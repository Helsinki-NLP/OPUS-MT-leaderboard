Members of the Galilor National Assembly are concerned about the fact that they might appear to be "marionites"
More members of the Galilor National Assembly are confused because they were suggested to change their title, respectively, by MWP (members of the Galior Parliament).
This problem has been caused by the plans to change the name of the meeting within the framework of the Irish Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly of Gallers present on the political scene are afraid that this would lead to radicalisation.
A member of the Labour Party of the Galior National Assembly is concerned that "he's staying with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Galiles: "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "fecal matter".
A member of the Gallers Party of the National Assembly of the Gallers stated that the group "is not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party stated that the group had an "open" attitude towards the change of name, but that it also observed that "MWP" was similar to "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in the Galior region as "u" in the English language spoken in Yorkshire.
The Customs Commission, which is currently preparing the legislation to introduce the name change, stated: "The final decision on how members are named will certainly depend on even the members concerned."
The Law of 2017 on the Government of the Galior Countries offered the Adjunari an opportunity to change their name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which led to the fact that many of these wish to use the "Galilor Parliament".
With regard to the title of members of the Galilor National Assembly, the Commission preferred "members of the Galilor Parliament" or "WMP", but the option "MWP" received the most votes in the public consultation.
It appears that the members of the National Assembly of Gallers have suggested alternative options, but the attempt to reach a consensus could lead to Elin Jones, the Chairman of the Steering Committee, who is expected to send the bill on amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the meeting works, including the rules on decalination of members and the structure of the Committee's system.
Members of the National Assembly will have the last word on their title when the law is discussed.
Macedonians voted in favour of the referendum on the change in country name
This Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their opinion on the change in their country's name in the "Northern Republic of Macedonia".
The popular vote was organised to resolve an old debate with Greece for several decades, the neighbouring country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Government of Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia 's accession to the EU and NATO .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opposition to the debate on the change in the name, said he would not take this vote into account.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is only a compromise that will enable them to join the EU and NATO.
The bishops of St. Martin's church stopped fighting as a result of the problems facing the churches in Harlem
"From a historical point of view, the veterans of the place I spoke with told me that you had previously found a bar and a church on every corner of the street," Adams said.
"Today, there are no bars and no churches."
He also said that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he said.
"The bars no longer play the day-to-day room for the whole career, where people usually run."
And with regard to churches, it is concerned that money obtained from the sale of goods will be spent faster than expected by the leaders and that, “more sooner or later, the unemployment will be the same”.
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condoms filled with people who would not support the remains of the cathedral.
"The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condoms in these buildings will be white-coloured," he said, "so this will speed up the closure of churches, as it is less likely that many people moving in these condoms will become members of their churches."
Both churches were built by white-colored congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of the Afro-Americans – the metropolitan community of St. Martin in 1870, after a decade.
The original methodological congregation, formed by white people, was moved from the area after 1930.
A congregation of Afro-American people, which carried out their religious activities in the vicinity, took over the building.
St. Martin's church was taken by an African-American congregation, led by the Governor John Howard Johnson, who condemned trades on 125th Street, a main road for Harlem purchases, which opposed the engagement or promotion of African-American people.
A fire that took place in 1939 affected the building very much, but Johnson’s jealous parents made plans to rebuild it and included the trailer in it.
Reverent David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father and successor to St. Martin's church, called the "sermen's clods".
The expert who put carilon into operation in July described it as "a cultural coumara" and "a historical instrument of non-replacement".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, further stated that he was the first American artist to be played by an Afro-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who spent 18 years in a major career in the Riverside church.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin.
What has been heard from St. Martin in recent months was a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought from church deacons, others from episcopal diocese.
The Holy Christ, the ruling entity of the parish, formed from diaconies, wrote the diocese in July to complain that the diocese "will seek to spend the costs" on the church, even if it was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the enormity complained of lack of transparency that proved diocese.
A river hurt a 13-year-old child who tries to catch men in California
According to the authorities, Saturday, a river attacked and wounded a 13-year-old child, while this one was trying to catch men in California on the day of the start of the home season.
The attack took place about 7:00 in the morning, near the beach Beacon from Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said for San Diego's KSWB-TV post that he spent about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy crying for help and then moved in with a group that helped him get out of the water.
Hammel further stated that at first he thought the boy was happy that he had caught a man, but then he realized that the cry “Must me!
He bit me!"
The whole key was broken, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I cried to all those who were in the water and said to them to come out of the water: "It is a river in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken with the helicopter at Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of the river responsible for the attack is unknown.
Salvamar, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a river in the area had been observed several weeks later, but it was concluded that it is not a species of river that represents a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma at the top of the throne.
The authorities restricted access to the Ponto beach from Casablad to Swami from Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security reasons .
Giles further mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area concerned, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Saninsbury Retaliator is planning to consolidate its position on the market of counterfeiting products and fashion in the British Sea
Saninsbury buys Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, placing radios with spray products in the style of a universal store, with specialist sales assistants.
As part of a consolidation of a position on the market for counterfeiting products in the British Sea, at 2.8 billion litres of esterline, which continues to grow, although sales of household and fashion products are not on the scale, the largest areas with counterfeiting products will be tested in 11 stores in the country and will be integrated into more stores in the following year if they prove to be successful.
Investment in the beauty industry comes in the context where supermarkets are looking for a way to use the previous space for televisions, microns and home products.
The representatives of the Saninsbury retreader said that the number of counterfeiting products he offers will be doubled by up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybeline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, like those of Boots stores.
The supermarket also relaxes its range of machinery products, Boutique, which means that most products are intended for private persons, a request from which young buyers are most likely to meet.
In addition, the products of the French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two magazines of the Saninsbury chain, for testing purposes, the first being opened last week in Croydon, in the south of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy less food each day from the nearest food store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of the Saninsbury dealer, said that the outlets will show more than universal stores, as supermarkets are trying to deal with large retail stores with cuts, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more services and non-food products.
Saninsbury has included both products from Argos outlet in hundreds of stores, as well as Habitas, since it bought both sales in two years, which means it recorded increases in food sales, as well as increased profits.
The former supermarket attempt to re-examine the pharmaceutical and infringement compartments has failed.
Saninsbury tried to merge with Boots early in 2000, but negotiations stopped after a difference on how to share the benefits of Boots stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Saninsbury sold the pharmaceutical business that included 281 stores, Celesio company, which holds Lloyds Pharmacy for 125 million sterline lires, after three years.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four magazines.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of the Saninsbury retailer, said: “I have transformed the aspect of our radios with counterfeiting products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized instruction of our colleagues, who will be available to offer you advice.
Our range of brands can be adapted to all needs, and the attractive environment and suitable locations turn us into an extraordinary location to buy counterfeiting products, revolutionising the old way of making purchases."
Peter Jones is angry after Holly Willoughby retired from a contract of 11 million pounds.
The television broadcast protagonist "Dragons' Den", Peter Jones, is furious after the TV presentation Holly Willoughby retired from a contract worth 11 million sterline litres with his life-style company, to focus on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time to engage in their project referring to Truly brand, which includes accessors and household items.
The couple's company was compared to Goop's brand, held by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning, at the age of 37, announced to Instagram that it will be withdrawn.
Holly Willoughby has generated Peter Jones's anger, the protagonist of the "Dragons' Den", withdrawing from their business that offers life-style services to focus on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became angry when one of the most expensive people on television acknowledged Tuesday, during a tense sitting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that their new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds of sterline, no longer allow them to dedicate their brands, Truly, including accessory and household items.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and almost doubled Willoughby's wealth, with an estimated 11 million pounds of sterline.
After Willoughby, at the age of 37, announced Instagram that he would give up on the contract for Truly, Jones left the British Sea to flee one of his holiday homes.
One source stated: “Truly was one of Holly’s priorities.
It would be her future in the long term, for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw has shocked everyone.
No one came to believe what happened last March, it was less until the launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at Marlow's headquarters that's ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the present "This Morning" issue, which is counted among the best sold from the British Sea, could lead to millions of losses, as a result of investments in products such as paints and lamps, clothing objects and household items, as well as the possible additional delay in the launch.
It can also represent the end of an extended friend.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, are friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby placed Truly brand bases together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as director in March.
Couples spend their vacations together, and Jones has 40% of Baldwin's TV production company's shares.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the master of the "I'm A Celebrity" broadcast from ITV.
A close source of Jones said last night: “We don’t want to talk about his business. ”
I was very hard, and then "we loved"
He made a joke on the basis of the criticisms he will receive from journalists because he made a comment that some would consider "not a president" and on the fact that he has such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
Trump said by imitating a voice from "the news presenter".
"I didn't take a step back."
He said Kim is interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a huge step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have stopped.
More than three months after Singapore's summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea had not noticed a "responsive" response from the United States on the previous demarcation of North Korea.
Instead, it noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to impose pressure in this regard.
Trump had a more optimistic point of view in his motivational speech.
"It's all going well with North Korea," he said.
"We must be heading towards a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his efforts to improve Kim's relationship had positive results: halting missile tests, support for the release of hostages and the return of American soldiers.
It also appeared to you the unusual way to talk about Kim's relationship.
"It's easy to behave like a president, but if I did, instead of 10,000 people outside, who are trying to get into this endless arena, there would be about 200 people," Trump said, pointing to the crowd that is in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island causing hundreds of deaths.
After the collapse of Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of the island of Lombok has been displaced, a national disaster has not been declared, a condition necessary for the proclamation of aid actions at the international level.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear about the fact that they do not require international assistance, so it is a very difficult situation," said Sumbung.
Although the foundation "Salvati children" is trying to form a team to travel to Paul, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies can contribute to aid efforts.
Given Indonesia's constant support, it is unlikely that the country will continue to be insufficiently prepared for the anger of nature.
Although adaptations to tsunamis have been built in Aceh , they are not met very soon on other costs .
It appears that the lack of a warning siren in the case of tsunamis in Palu, although a warning has been issued in this sense, could have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, travel between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
The natural disasters are complex and more so.
A hospital that has been stationed in Lombok to deal with the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place where the new disaster occurred.
President Joko Widodo proposed that improving adequate infrastructure in Indonesia be the central point of its electoral campaign and allocate money for roads and roads.
But the lack of funds has affected Joko's administration, which will take part next year in a new electoral campaign.
Joko is also faced with persistent pressure from the sections of Indonesia, as members of the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes because gangs of Christians and Muslims were burned on the streets, using cats, bows and arrows, as well as other weapons of mass destruction.

Cromwell's status in Parliament becomes the most recent monumental monument affected by the "recording of history"
Their departure would represent a poetic justice for the destruction in the Taliban style of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts made by its fanatic Puritans.
But Cromwell's company described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "a crazy" and "an attempt to re-repetitate history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, said: “It was inevitable in this debate on the disappearance of states as Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Westminster Palace to become a hostage.
The icononclass of civil war English was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe a wrong Cromwell would have sacrificed for the actions of his dear Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many believe deserves to celebrate.
Goldsmith stated for The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as Parliament's advocate against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Regardless of whether it is about an accurate representation, this is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
But certainly, the conflict from the mid-first century has determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual identifiable figure, which is part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector deserve also celebrated and remembered."
A pig caused the death of a farmer in China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local press agencies.
The man, identified only after the name of the family "Yuan", was found dead after he was split into an art and was covered with blood, near a pig farm located on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou, according to the daily editor of Morning Post in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs vaccines at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It seems she came with her cousin from Yunnan's nearby province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his wife found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby cottage was open.
This said there's a lot of a man with a big blood in his mouth in his pocket.
Lawyers confirmed that a pig of about 300 kg caused the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My husband's bones were full of blood and cut off," said the truth, whose family name is "Wu", for Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance rooms recorded Yuan entering the market today at 4:40 a.m. to feed their pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the man's death was not part of Yuan, nor was it true.
A market representative said for Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent him from attacking someone else, while the police kept evidence from the crime scene.
It seems that Yuan's family and the authorities negotiate compensation for his death.
Although it is rare, cases of pigs that have attacked people have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a 300 kg pig, a man from Galior country was blocked in his tractor until his wife came to scare and kill the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not aggressive in a normal way, but that the taste of blood could declare such reactions."
"Just play.
They like to move, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them respect," he said.
Rosa's hurricane, which has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rains in the southwestern United States
As predicted, the Rosa hurricane loses its intensity as it moves to the most recent waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring rain that will cause floods in northern Mexico and in the southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosa records wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a category 1 hurricane on Sunday from 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will arrive in the north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it began to form a depressed area over the Pacific Ocean and move east, along the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula, the moon, in the form of a tropical storm, will begin to push intense tropical moisture from the north to the south-west of the United States.
Monday, Rosa will bring precipitations up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical humidity that will interact with the depressed area will generate abundant rains in the south-west in the next days.
Local, precipitations between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid floods, floods of habitats and possibly land flooding in the desert.
The intense tropical humidity will cause rates of up to 5 and 8 cm precipitation per hour in certain areas, especially in some parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitations covering between 5 and 10 cm are expected in the south-west, especially in most Arizona.
It is possible to have rapid flooding due to rapid deterioration conditions as a result of the nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to adventure in the desert below, given the threat posed by tropical rain.
The strong rain could cause the canyons to be transformed into violent rivers, and the storms will bring local winds into the raffles and dust.
The depressive area near will bring torrential rains in areas off the southern coast of California.
Nearly 2 cm precipitations are possible, which could determine minor flows of habitats and alumni routes.
These will be the first precipitations in the region, in the weed season.
Tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on the second part of the Sunday and on the first part of the month, before the rain will spread over the next few months and Tuesdays.
The intense precipitations will spread in the so-called "four crops" March and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes will be recorded in the U.S., as the Arctic region will become warmer, but tropicals remain quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature on short distances.
Sunday, dramatic temperature differences are encountered at the central area of the United States.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the long heat of truth will try to form and expand again.
It is expected that a large part of the central and eastern U.S. area will be faced with a hot start of October, with temperatures up to 27 degrees in outer areas, from the south to some parts of the north-east.
March, New York City could reach 27 degrees, with about 4 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high temperatures in the middle of the United States until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people followed Brett Kavanaugh's audition
More than 20 million people have followed the press statement supported by the candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual attack that was alleged to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, political confrontation continued, TV posts interrupting the normal Friday program for a recent hour: an agreement concluded between Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona to conduct an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford said in front of the ruling committee that it is 100% sure that Kavanaugh earned it while it was in the state of Hebrews and that he tried to throw it out at a school party.
Kavanaugh, as part of an intense witness, said it's 100% certain that this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have followed the hearing on Friday.
The company counted the average vision of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems with confiscating people who see it from the office.
To put this thing in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a football game in play-off or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's number, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the day-to-day hearing.
ABC was on second place, with a number of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was followed by 3.1 million people, 2.14 million NCBs, 2.89 million MSNBCs and 2.52 million CNNs.
The interest remained at a high level after hearing.
Flake was in the middle of the winter drama.
After the Office of the moderate Republican has issued a statement to vote in Kavanaugh's favour, he was filmed by CNN and CBS's chambers tomorrow morning while the protesters were shouting at it and he is trying to move in a lift to a sitting of the Judicial Committee.
He's been looking down for a few minutes while people beat him, and everything was delivered directly to CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling us the truth?
It was said to them: "You are strong, while such women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator, that he would have more to say at the Commission's seat.
Televisions later released the vote directly within the Judicial Committee to advance the nomination of Kavanaugh for the Senate's vote.
But Flake said he'd do this only if the FBI would agree to analyse the charges against nominalism next week, which is requested by minority democracies.
Flake was largely convinced of conversations with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and more senators after that.
Flake's election was important, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes necessary to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accused the "political games" of Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with the future of the British Sea and subsidizing national interests in an interview for Sunday Times.
Theresa May, Prime Minister Marii Britanii, participated in the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to his photo accompanying the newspaper's first page, former prime minister Boris Johnson launched an attack on their plan for Brexit, so-called Chequers, saying that the proposal for the Great Britain and the European Union to collect their rates was "irradiated".
Wade Sims' shooting: The police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected he shot the LSU player fatally
The police arrested a suspect in case of the death shooting of Wade Sims, the LSU basketball player at the age of 20.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and closed, accused of crime of grade 2, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published the video of the encounter between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the raid.
The police recovered the cover from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, according to WAFB, CBS affiliated.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police say it recognized the fact that he shot Wade fatally.
His bail was fixed at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Legal Medicine Office Baton Rouge published a preliminary report yesterday, saying death was caused by a head shot through the throat.
The Department agrees with the police force of Louisiana, the state's criminal police lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area concerned, for the aid offered in the investigation, which led to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for "diligentity and the search for rights".
Sims was 20 years old.
The attack with a height of 1.98 m grew in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball for LSU.
Last season, it marked, on average, 5.6 points and had 2.6 recovery.
Tomorrow morning, the coach of the LSU basketball team, Will Wade, said that the team is "damaged" and "evicted" by Wayne's death.
"This thing bothers me all the time," said Wade.
A volcano threw a colony of cenus beyond Mexico City
The census from the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern cartels of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens to keep their distance from the volcano after crater activity was declared and 183 gas and gas emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre monitors more sights and vibrations.
The images on socialization networks presented below-censorship layers on machine parbrills in Mexican City's maps, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians observed an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km south of the capital, after an earthquake with 7.1 magnitude exploded in September 2017 in the center of Mexico.
The well-known volcano "Don Goyo" is active in 1994.
Interpolation between the Catalan separatists before the vote of independence
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after the pro-independence protesters burned down with the yards, on the first anniversary of the vote for the Catholic section, throwing thousands of protestors behind.
A group of masked pro-separatists held at the distance of yards bombed it with eggs and powder, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets which were usually flooded by tourists.
The effort was intensified later, the police using their own strengths to control the situation.
For a few hours, the self-dependence groups have scandalized "We don't look, we don't forgive," while the Union's protesters have shouted "Living Spain!".
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during protests, according to local press.
The tensions remain at a high level in the region that wants to become independent one year after the referendum on 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters have chosen, in a overwhelming majority, to become independent, although participation in the vote has been reduced, and those against the section have voted in large part.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting at the regional voting centres, with violent harassment.
The Pro-Independence Groups campaigned last night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, aged 68, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of gaining independence from Catalonia.
"Last year I lived some of the most beautiful moments of my life.
I saw my parents crying with joy that I can vote, but now we don't have what to do," he said.
Despite the acquisition of a vital but firm victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independent parties have tried to keep progress this year, many of the most famous leaders are either in exile or in detention, waiting for judgment for the role they played in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded his protest on his phone in support of the police, said that politicians from both sides have fed the conflict.
"The situation becomes more tense," he said.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the new Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced that he will apply for elections for the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for European elections, it is the best way to express regret in the democratic values and the repression I have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: More men were arrested after entering a house with a car

It seems that at a given time, an anti-car was used.
Menga's hit helped the team Livingston win with 1-0 in front of the Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston has ensured victory
Livingston left the Rangers team unrepealed, Steven Gerard reaching the second launch in 18 matches, as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to make the difference while Gary Holt's team played at the same level with the Hibernian in the second round.
Gerard's team remains without a victory in moving to Premier League this season and faces Hearts leaders, behind them with eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers finds Speed Vienna in Europe League joi.
Meanwhile, Livingston is still not involved in the division until six matches, Holt's main trainer still feels the taste of French because he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston gives his chance against the cruel visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead long before writing, and their orientation caused all kinds of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to land and try to jump on the port space, and then Alan Lithgow managed to jump wide after he entered by studying to intercept the mine sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The bosses were pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could make visitors trouble with their free shots.
And that was the way the crucifix came.
Rangers accepted a free strike, and Livingston succeeded in opening up, Declan Gallagher and Robinson working to pass on Menga, who jumped and marked from his center.
At that time, Rangers dominated the possession, but he faced the impensable defense of the master, and porter Liam Kelly was no longer deeply disturbed in the rest of the game.
This game model continued in the second round, although Alfredo Morelos strengthened a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman did not succeed against Allan McGregor of Rangers, and Lithgow gave a long shot from another player of the Livingston team.
The diagonal steps continued to come into which the team of Livingston, but without success, and the two applications of the penalty - after Halkett broke Glenn Middleton and after a while - were not accepted.
"Fenomenal game" offered by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotch on Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to go beyond the expectations of an ascending trajectory.
Their game style and team didn't change any more since they returned to the top, but Holt had to agree on how he had trained his team since he took it.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble during the entire party.
But the Rangers weren't too inspired.
Although they had good performance since they were led by Gerard, they didn't meet the same standards.
The goose steps have been unsuccessful, they have succeeded once to catch the gate of free opponents, and this should be a warning signal for Rangers, which is located in the middle of the class.
Joint reactions to Erdogan's visit to Köln
It was Saturday (29 September), when the Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin to take breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to remedy the relations between NATO alliances.
These are unmistakably due to problems such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Köln to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 in front of the mosque, but enough supporters gathered near to see the President.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, the majority of the Kurzi, heard the vote, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it with the arms open in the country.
The controversial protests reflect the division of a visitor considered to be a hero of some of the Turks of Germany and an autocratic of others.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies after a collision with a car
A biker died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place at the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeastern town, about 10:15.
The car driver stopped, and the paramedics were present at the scene of the accident, but the man died outside the scene.
The accident took place only a few months after another biker died after an accident that took place on Childers Street, where the driver fled from the spot, which is about a thousand of the place where the Saturday accident took place.
The metropolitan police said the officers were trying to identify the man and inform him of his duties.
Access is restricted in the area concerned, bus track is due and motorcyclists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured after an arrest
Six prison officers were injured after a high-security prison for men, a prison representative said.
On Sunday, a break at HMP Long Martin from Worcestershire at about 9:30, this being underway.
Specialized offices have been brought in to take care of heating, involving eight detained persons, isolated in an aripe.
The officers were treated outside the place for minor injuries to the front.
A prison guard stated: “The assistance of the prison staff was requested to deal with an incident at the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical attention after they were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules regarding responsible persons, who will be transferred to the police and may spend a longer period of time after grace."
There are more than 500 detainees in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last year, in October, the ill-treatment officers were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, the staff being attacked by billiards.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are at risk of being flooded because of Rosa's hurricane (sectous areas can enjoy benefits as a result of this)
It is rare to have a tropical depression in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because the remaining energy resources of the Rosa hurricane will be used in the south-west desert, presenting a rapid risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings of rapid flooding for months and years in the clothing zone of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, southern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will have a direct trajectory to Phoenix on Tuesday, and on the second part of the month she will cause prepitations.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service announced in a message on Twitter that "only ten tropical cyclones kept a stand of wind or tropical depression on a distance of approximately 320 km to Phoenix in 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane acting on a distance of about 60 km across the border with Arizona."
The most recent models of the National Centre for Uragane predict precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated quantities up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the desert in the south-west, including in the centre of the Stancoși and the Basin Mountains, there will be recorded quantities of between 3 and 5 cm, with total quantities of up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, since the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, in some areas torrential rain will be beneficial because the south-west is facing drought.
According to the U.S. Seed Monitor, less than 40% of Arizona is faced with at least one severe drought, according to the second largest category", information on weather.com.
First, the Rosa hurricane will lead to landslides in the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who still has the power of hurricane in the morning of Sunday, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north, 19 km per hour.
The storm will meet the most recent water in the Pacific and will therefore decrease.
Thus, it is expected that it will produce field studies in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or the evening of the month.
Many torrentials in Mexico could be significant, presenting a high risk of floods.
"We are waiting for torrential rains covering between 8 and 10 cm" from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, and can reach 25 cm," according to weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north, in Mexico, as a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the morning of March, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching south of Utah on the night of March.
"The dangerous capital represented by Rosa or her remains is the extreme torrential rain in Baja California, northern Sonora and desert in the southwestern United States," said a representative of the National Centre for Uruguay.
It is expected that these floods will produce massive floods that will endanger people's lives, and will bring floods of habitats in deserts as well as earthquakes in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested as a result of a murder attempt after a 16-year-old man was found with injuries caused by incineration in Somerset.
The teen was found wounded in the Great Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday, about 04:00.
He was taken to the hospital, where he's in a stable state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested tonight in Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The officers asked for help from citizens who might have material on the phone, respectively, to appear in the police section.
Trump declared that Kavanaugh faced "unmoving and hands" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the negative and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump further stated that Kavanaugh faced "unmoving and hands" of the Democratic Party during its nomination.
Joi, Kavanaugh filed testimony before Congress, denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that she had been sexually abused ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also filed testimony in court concerning her claim.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage that day."
"A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best minds of this generation's legal domain," he said to many supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the nomination of Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the Republican presence in the inter-elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our life.
I'm not a candidate, but, somehow, I'm a candidate," he said.
"For this reason, I am expressing over all my positive opinion on candidates whom I consider to be non-memorial."
Trump argued that democracy is in a mission to "resist and obstruct".
It is expected that the first procedural vote key to the Senate since Kavanaugh's nomination will take place late Friday, a GOP driver for CNN said.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia, the number growing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being taken by the red values that hit the beaches, when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawese in Indonesia, the authorities declared Saturday.
Hundreds of people stayed at a beach festival in the city of Palu, when values with a height of six meters hit the beach at the amurg, people were taken from the water and destroyed everything along their way.
The tsunami was followed by a quake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the tsunami threat was released yesterday, people still saw their activities on the beach and didn't get away immediately, becoming such victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, BNPB spokesman for the disaster relief agency, said at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami has brought its own cars, ports, houses, hitting everything on its way," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami has travelled at a speed of 800 km/h before the earthquake struck.
It added that some people had to go to the cabins to get rid of the tsunami and survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The photos published by the disaster agency present more destroyed buildings and stores, damaged and damaged doors, as well as a waterproof mosque.
Saturday, the remains continued to rustle the city found on the coast.
The cut-off series has been felt in a zone of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy generated by the strong winter drought was about 200 times greater than the power of the Hiroshima nuclear bomb from World War II.
The city's geographical structure, which is at the end of a long and pleasant golf course, has probably intensified the expansion of the tsunami, has added its representative.
Nugroho described the damage as being "extended" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of victims were found under the walls of damaged buildings, he said, along with 540 injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that the victims and the payments could be larger than the coast of 300 km north of Palu, a area called Doghara, which is closer to the border epicenter.
The communications were "completely disturbed, without any information" from Doghraha, Nugroho said.
There they live more than 300,000 people," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers are moving to the affected areas.
He added: "This is already a tragedy, but you might be disappointed."
Saturday, the agency was criticised for not informing the fact that a tsunami would hit Palu, although the authorities stated that the values had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In socializing networks, a man found at the top floor of a building may be heard warning that the tsunami is approaching people on the street.
Within a few minutes, a water wall falls off the ground, carrying these buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major interruption of electricity, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate the efforts of the authorities to save.
The army began to send freight aircraft from Jakarta and other cities to the authorities, but evacuated persons still need food and other basics.
The city airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the Palu evacuation centres for Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia goes up to 800 people.
The situation is extremely serious.
While the Word Vision staff from Dothra arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are trapped in improvised shelters in the court of the office, they passed by devastating scenes, Doseba said.
It added: "They told me they saw many destroyed houses."
The situation is very serious.
Even if aid groups began to delay aid operations in case of disaster, some people complained that foreign workers with comprehensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to the regulations of Indonesia, financial resources, the delivery of materials and personnel can only be achieved at the place of production of a charity if a national disaster zone is declared.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"After the government says, "Yes, this is a national disaster," we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has yet been announced."
After the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the missing hope that their dear ones will be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
Saturday, a boy was taken out of a canal.
Sunday, the rescue staff released a woman who was under two days' ruin with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subbandono, the coach of the national team of parapants, trained for Asian Games, which were completed early this month in Indonesia, two of the parapant pilots disappeared.
Other people at Roa Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandige, were her students.
"In view of the experience in the field of parapet activity, I have my own emotional poverty," she said.
Gendon told how, a few hours after spreading news about the arrival of the Roa Roa Hotel in the community of sports practitioners with parapanta, he sent desperate messages on WhatsApp to the Palu competitors who participated in the beach organised festival.
But at the right of his messages, there appeared only one grey bee, and not two white beers.
"I think this means that the messages have not been transmitted," he said.
A group of hostages stole $26,750 while feeding a Newport banknote on the Levee
Tomorrow morning, the hotels stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who fed a banknote in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Department of Police in Newport.

Kanye West: The rapper changes the scene name to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West changes the scene name to "Ye".
This Saturday announced the change in Twitter: "The person officially known as Kanye West".
West, at the age of 41, is called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of the album's optical album, launched in June.
This change comes before his appearance at the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
This comes to the issue at the site of the song Ariana Grande, which has canceled "for the sake of emotional nature", said the producer of the issue.
In addition to the fact that it is a summary of the current name of the scene, West stated earlier that this word also has a religious meaning for it.
"I think "ye" is the most commonly met word in the Bible, and in the Bible means "you," said West at the beginning of this year, during the discussion on the title of the album with the master Big Boy radio.
"So I am you, I am us, it is about us.
Everything started from "Kanye", which means only, and got to "Yes", this being a reflection on our good, bad, unclear and whole things.
The album is more a reflection of what we are as individuals."
He's one of many rappers who have chosen to change their scene name.
Sean Combs had countless names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
And a former West co-laborator, JAY-Z, has changed his name sometimes with shorts, others without, as well as with great letters.
Mexico's President promises not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised he would never use military forces against civilians, once the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against students.
Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to stop the Mexican people".
The troops withdrew from the market on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when students' left movements were being pushed into Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has been committed to supporting young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who study and by opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attracted young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for IA
While China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it costs for research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and the user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after more U.S. government members made announcements about IA even though there is no official strategy for artificial intelligence in the US.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it proposes to be the first place on IA innovation by 2030.
"Dublining the IA research budget would be a good start, given that all the other countries are far behind the U.S. and that we are looking for the next IA discovery," said Lee.
The duplication of funds could double the chances that the next major implementation in the IA area would be carried out in the US, Lee told the CNC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "IA Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most prominent companies, Face+.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that won American player Othello, which was the best in the area at the time, and later was executive director at Microsoft Research and the head of the Google branch in China.
She appreciated the previous competitions of the US governments in the field of technology, such as Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects, and asked when it would be next to help identify the following vision.
U.S. researchers have to work hard many times to get government funds, Lee said.
"Not China puts bees in the hands of academic leaders, but the corporations," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired significant graduates from universities to work at IA in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. to intensify its IA efforts.
"I think it should be offered automatically to doctors in IA," he said.
The State Council of China issued a Plan for the Development of New Artificial Intelligence Generations in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to persons from academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations offering money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, says Lee.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defence of the United States established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, with a view to involving partners in the field and academics, and Casa Albá announced the formation of a selection committee in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced an investment of $2 billion for an initiative called "AI Next".
At the same time, NSF invests more than 100 million dollars per year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, no changes have been made in the legislation of the United States aimed at creating a Commission for National Security in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote on the referendum if they want to change their country name
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they want the name of the country to be changed to the "North Macedonian Republic" a change that would solve an old debate with Greece, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which covers a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments reached agreement in June with regard to the new name proposed, but the opposing nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the slave majority population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum and that a polling campaign had raised doubts as to the vote, since it was possible not to reach a minimum of 50%, necessary for the referendum to be validated.
The question on the referendum ballot will be: "Do you agree to join the EU and NATO by accepting the agreement with Greece?".
Supporters for the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that has resulted from the breakup of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted in entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia live free under the shadow of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old, said in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, quite a number of Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
In order for the name to be changed, there is a need for a two-thirds round in Parliament.
The State electoral commission stated that the irregularities were not reported by 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% at the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of voting rights persons were present in the vote.
"We have come to vote for my children and our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, a voter from Skopje, the capital of the country.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, voted for the referendum on the change in the name of Macedonia, which will allow them to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, at 54 years of age, prepared a small-scale scene and set up a seat in front of the high courts of those who would vote for the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with the top front and not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted with Macedonia's name, we can move to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev stated that NATO accession will bring so much needed investments in Macedonia, which has a higher unemployment rate of 20%.
"I think the majority will be in favour of the change of name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of NATO and the EU," Zaev said after the vote.
This said that an outcome in favour of the change of name would be "confirming our future".
According to a survey published last month by the Policy Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of eligible citizens will participate in the referendum, below the number of participants required.
According to another survey conducted by Telema TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour of the change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
The example of the referendum would represent the first serious hit at the level of the pro-vest government policy since the government was launched last month.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City is able to cross the entire defense of the Brighton team and march a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to cross the defense of the Brighton team and gain Saturday victory of the Manchester City team with 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Looks like Aguero's been incredibly easy to walk in about 65 minutes.
Argentinian attack took place in the middle of the ground at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly between three defense players from Brighton, before he reached the free end of the field.
Then Aguero woke up by four players of the opposite team.
He managed to get through a defense, and then he went over a lot of other adverts on the edge of the Brighton team.
After that, he gave a walk to the left, the balloon coming to Sterling.
The English attacker sent Aguero's balloon back, which hit the right leg of the ball, successfully avoiding it on the bridge from Brighton, Matthew Ryan, with a seat on the right side of the port.
"Aguero faces some problems on his feet," said the reporters Pep Guardiola, the manager of the Manchester City team.
"I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he wrote a hole at that time."
But Sterling is the one who got their initial advantage for the Azuri in the Premier League game.
The ball came in 29 minutes.
Aguero's got a deep passage on the territory of the Brighton team at that stage.
Then he gave Leroy Sane's left arm.
Sane broke the balloon several times until he sent out a Sterling pass, which sent it in the direction of the port.
The Azuri attack hit the balloon to the spot right before moving out of the ground.
Manchester City will meet Tuesday, at 12:55 p.m., with Hoffenheim in the group phase, on Rhine-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make the raids in the game against Rockies.
With the national team removed from the game in play-off, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday in the match against the Colorado Rockies team, but only if there are still stakes in play-off for Rockies, which have an advantage with a game in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies got at least an unlikely place, with a 5-2 win against the national team this Friday night, but he's still trying to keep his first division title.
"Even if we don't play for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere from here, from Denver, along with many, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in these circumstances?"
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the game on Sunday, but according to sources, it is intended to let Scherzer take the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would have been on the launch of the game with number 34, had a hot session and will be released in normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington Environment has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2,53 and 300 ratings in 220 and 2/3 matches this season.
Trump expresses support in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation regarding a decision by the Supreme Court in relation to Brett Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of the Republican presence in the intermediate elections.
"All our efforts are in play in November.
There are five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the great, not candidate, but actually candidate, so I try to support the good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, radical group of democracies, you see what is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any necessary means, you can see their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to heal to get power and control, that's what they want, they have power and control, and we won't give it."
It further said that democracy is in a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"And you can see this in the last four days," he added, describing democracies as "frust and wicked, arrogant and liars."
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party and who is part of the Senate's Judicial Committee, which has been strongly defeated by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Excuse me?
No, um... I'm... I'm... I'm just--it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Laburist party no longer tolerates people with a different view.
People who express their opinion are no longer tolerated
It didn't surprise me at all that the Momentum activists from my local party supported the censorship movement in my case.
After all, I am just one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who was told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received a similar treatment because he was concerned about anti-Semitism.
As far as I am concerned, the censorship campaign represented a criticism to my address because I didn't agree with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
With regard to the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar problems, ironically, regarding which Jeremy had no common opinion with previous leaders.
The communication for the Nottingham East Winter Meeting of the Labour Party states that "we want our seats to be inclusive and productive".
In most of the eight-year period as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC's evening sessions were like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are not conducted in this way today, and the promise of a political environment "better, better" has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever been respected.
It has become more evident that the different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of what is accepted by the party's leadership.
Things have started to be like this since Jeremy became leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common vision on politics began to expect me to change my thinking and agree with some things I would not have agreed before, including national security or the EU's single market.
Every time I speak in public, regardless of what I say, it follows a wave of abuses on the dissociation networks that demand my removal from the party, accusing me of central politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person facing this.
In fact, I know I'm happier than my colleagues, because comments about my person tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by professionalism and the determination to prove to my colleagues that they are faced with sexual or racial abuse, but I keep their level of involvement in this sense.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this political crisis is the fact that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different points of view within the party, and with each motive of censorship or change of the selection rules, the party becomes less flexible in this regard.
Many people have recommended me in the last two years to put my head down, not to be so loud, and everything "will be fine" like that.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, I was motivated by the fact that the ignorance that has shown that government Thatcher has led to my class failure, I wanted to fight for better public services for those who need them most, as local councillor or minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including the last elections.
No person from Nottingham East can say that I am inconsistency with my views on politics and aspects that are not in agreement with current conduct.
Those who have supported the movement of the winter can only tell them that, in the context of the country's approach to Brexit, which will affect our local economies, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to grow time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to deliver is not for the Momentum group of Nottingham, but for citizens whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat to the removal of the party or political opportunity will stop me from making the decisions I consider to be in your best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr football team reaches the top of the classics
Despite the fact that two late attempts have influenced in some way the final result, there is no doubt about the fact that Ayr deserves to win the extremely interactive game from today's Tennt's Premiership.
It's now at the top of the classroom, being the only team without any break in the ten.
Finally, everything was summarized in their best defense, as well as in the fact that they benefited more from the chances, which helped the host team and thanked coach Peter Murchie.
"We have been subjected to more tests during our encounters up to this time and we continue to be uncertain, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "The merit of the Ayr team has benefited from more than us."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute trial, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave him an advantage to the Ayr team, but a Cartoonist received by Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, this playing at the Warriors, allowed the Melrose team to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an untransformatted attempt.
Climo got a pen for Ayr and, right in half of the game, he managed to write, and then he managed to convert an individual trial, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at break.
But Melrose started the second very good rehearsal, and Patrick Anderson's ex, Baggot's transformation, reduced the margin to five points.
The game has been suspended for a few minutes because of the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was removed from the field with the flag, and since the start of the game, Ayr has been detached through the experiment of player Stafford McDowell, transformed from Climo.
Captain Ayr's team, Blair Macpherson then received a Galben cardboard and again, the Melrose team made him pay for Bruce Colvine's untransformatted attempt at the end of a complete press.
However, the boss team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a gallonian cardboard because he liked Climo without coins, MacPherson managed to march, offering the advantage of the Air team.
Climo transformed the test, as he did again almost since the beginning of the game, after Kyle Rowe performed a "box kick" movement and sent the extreme Gregor Henry deep for the fifth attempt of the team.
View of the Still Game site prepared for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the site of Still Game, seems ready to move into the hospital industry after he found out he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The man, at 56 years of age, plays Jack Jarvis' role in the beloved BBC show, writing his scenario and playing with his long-term partner, the comedy actor Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that the next series, the new number, will be the last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official register, this is the director of the company Aposimorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to be involved in "the restaurant development industry".
"The sea is ours": the island of Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a ship's seat full of macaroles in La Paz.
Public buildings are wooded by the white stage, such as the ocean.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is our right.
We have to get it back."
From Bolivia, which is not large, the memory of a cost lost before Chile in a bloody conflict of the resources of the 19th century is still alive – just as the desire to re-ship in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are likely at the highest level in the last decade, as Bolivia is waiting for a decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the necessary progress, a spirit of unity and maturity and, of course, looks forward to the outcome with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will make a decision in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intensive discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to the sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who is faced with a war that is controversial for the re-election of next year – also has many winners since the month's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts think it's less likely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that it would change too little if it happened.
The United Nations body within the Netherlands is unable to agree on the territory belonging to Chile and has provided that it will not determine the outcome of the possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes only six months after the final pleas have been heard indicates that this case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law.
And not only that Bolivia didn't succeed, but it's possible that the last four years would be given back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been caused by current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' blessed rhetoric weakened any Chilean residual well-being, suggested it.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at a given time, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not replaced Ambassadors since 1962.
Vice-President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making process of the court was not used quickly.
The day of the month will bring Bolivia "a wonderful opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance "to end the 139 years of mutual disagreement," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – one of the most beloved presidents of Latin America – used maritime problems as a political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go through the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place if it cannot be trusted in the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, said his country would never disarmament its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to respect the promises made during a Singapore summit with rival leaders.
Its comments come in the context in which US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be at the point of relaunching diplomatic action on nuclear threat after more than three months from the Singapore meeting with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri stated that it is a "real vision" such as the continuing sanctions and the United States' object of the declaration on the end of the Korean war to make the northern territory ever surrender.
Washington has reticences to agree with the statement without the Phoenician taking first significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there are many exceptions that don't believe that the Phoenician has a serious intention to give up the arsenal that the country considers to be the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo intends to visit the Phenian next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion presentation from Paris presents the latest trends in hairdressing and will be available in recent magazines
If you are looking for shoes to extend your collection or to protect you completely from the sun, you must not search any more.
The fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne were looking for participants at the Paris Mode Week, launching a series of oversized and extravaganced haircuts for their spring-to- spring collection 2019.
The almost practical walls have dug the Instagram platform in this summer, and fashion designers have sent out creatures that are blind to the podium.
The piece of resistance of creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagance, well-coloured hair, with a large bar, similar to a pen, where the heads of models were buried.
Other oversized accessors have included pears that are wrapped with mares, a wet coat and even a pineapple, but they are not created to protect your head against the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of beavers, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had worn lips and brought more of Hannibal Lecter's choice accessory, and did not modulate high corners.
One of the creatures seemed to be a washing equipment, having an oxygen tube and glasses, while another seemed to be a frozen baby.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a style of dress, with oversized clothing articles, you are lucky.
Stylists predict a return of huge beads in luxury stores.
The above-sized walls come back after the appearance of the La Bomba hair, the wall with a large bar, seen all over the world, from Rihanna and to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the nearly practical haircut which appeared on all socializing networks caused the appearance of another oversized creature on the podium, respectively, of beach people, with a size as large as the model of bathing as it wears.
Genta portocale of Rafia, with raffles and a white leather handle, was part of the resistance of the spring-war 2019 collection "La Riviera" by Jacquemus in the Week of Modei from Paris
Visualist Luke Armitage said to the FCCC: "I expect to see hair and beach people oversized in luxury stores next summer, because the fashion maker had such a powerful impact that it will be difficult to ignore the application for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills, essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland hold a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results for examinations, which is supported by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other Community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students from Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scots Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to provide services at the highest level to their students and parents.
Independent schools propose to prepare their students for higher and higher education, their choice of career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak in his own tongue, the words reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot only base ourselves on English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
On the basis of the recent results of this year's competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the classes, with the highest promotion rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have obtained a Higher degree A certificate.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students obtained a High degree A certificate in Mandarin; 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish received such a certificate.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills for which children and young people will need, certainly, in the future.
Now, foreign languages, such as matter, are treated as STEM subjects (Scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school courses and in other fields.
A survey carried out by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17% of the reason employers gave them for the struggle for job creation was a lack of linguistic skills.
Thus, more and more, linguistic skills become imperative for preparing young people for their future career.
With more opportunities for jobs that require foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such skills throughout life.
The ability to communicate directly to people from foreign countries will automatically place a multilingual person before competition.
According to a poll by YouGov of over 4,000 adults in the British Sea in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
Therefore, investment in learning foreign languages is important for children today.
With more languages, especially in developing countries, children will have greater opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, there will always be more choice languages in independent schools, with educational frameworks that are specialized in this area.
Independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of their future.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so that it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it well (Trebuie made).
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will start at Lakers Sunday in San Diego.
Waiting is almost over for the fans who want to see LeBron James as he starts for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers team coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening of Sunday's jail against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
But in a few minutes, it'll still be fixed.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James will probably play a few minutes.
Following the training from the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers program of six games in the press.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need games in the press to prepare me," he said.
Time of Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign meetings this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five tunings of Trump programmed in the following week, including stops in places where the electorate is favorable to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote of confirmation for his election candidate for the place free from the Supreme Court is suspended temporarily, Trump wishes to consolidate support for future elections from the centre of the mandate, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
At what hour will Trump's election meeting take place in West Virginia tonight and where can I follow it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00, East Coast time, Sunday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's electoral meeting online in West Virginia via the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearing by Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, hearings that have become tense because of sexual misconduct, while the Senate's expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week in order for the FBI to investigate the charges.
But the main objective of this series of encounters is to help the Republicans, who face difficult elections in November, win a bit of land.
Thus, President Trump's campaign stated that the role of these five meetings next week is "to empower volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority held in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The control over Congress is so important for its programme that the President will travel as many states as possible before entering the highly agglomerated campaign season," a spokesman for Trump's campaign said to Reuters, who did not want to be named.
Planned to take place in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the meeting tonight could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be presented in the media in Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won the elections at a 40 percent difference in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is conducting a survey.
"The fact that the president came to try to promote him in the survey is not a good sign for Morrisey," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Ryder 2018: U.S. team gives evidence of determination and continues to fight to keep the chance for simple tests that start Sunday
After three clearly-dominated sessions, it is possible that the exercise on Saturday afternoon would have been exactly what Cupa Ryder needed.
The always oscillating pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the sports world, but players really believe in it, as much as in competitions like this.
So where's their motive now?
"We were driven by six points, now the difference is only four points, so we are based on this down for a little bit of motivation," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point advance, while there are still twelve points in the game.
Americans, says Spieth, feel that the game is starting to change in their favour and that there are enough reasons for encouragement, of which the most important is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and won every few of the four points.
Spieth sent miles to the green area with a lethal precision, being an example for her colleagues.
Those wedding gulps became more and more amusing as they ran forward, especially when he entered a crucial point by which he re-readed the score in the fourth game, after he and Thomas were driven by two points after the first two holes.
The hit by which he won the game at 15 was celebrated with a similar urlet, a urlet that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
"You just need to concentrate and worry about your own game," Spieth says.
That's how these players are left.
18 guys to leave a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of the Ryder Cupe.
The strange but adorable husband of Europe won four out of four matches and it seems I can't make a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only reason they didn't need any extra hit Saturday afternoon, but this statement is valid for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, even for the new points of Friday morning.
This performance and the way their energy appears to run around and within the public enthusiasm reinforces the idea that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if it would lead to the end of Europe's potential victory when the sun falls over Le Golf National.
preferable, both at the same time, to different gloves.
The debate on the glory of Europeans remains premature, however.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson passed quickly by Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning at the fourballs trial, when it made a party with Alex Noren.
An additional hit and two double at the first nine holes they threw it on the Spanish and Swedish in a cave so deep that they weren't even close enough to get out of it.
Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
The samples of furballs and furzom are fascinating and worthy followed by almost due to the interactions between parties, data and unknowns and the way in which a strategy can be changed at the place.
Europeans have played better than teams so far and have a significant advantage at the end of the day, but this exercise session has shown and that the US team has reason to keep fighting, something some, especially those in the United States, doubt.
Europe runs with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will start the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after it has completed its four-ball matches and Saturdays with an advantage of 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspiration of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led offensively with two winners in front of an exhausted Tiger Woods, which has increased their score since now at Le Golf National at four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to recover the trophie he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made a lot of mistakes in the morning's fourballs trial and won the series with score 3 to 1.
THE U.S. opposed a more serious resistance to the exercise, where it won two matches, but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points of the 12 simple Sunday matches to keep the trophie.
Fleetwood is the first European news that wins four points along the line, and together with Molinari, a pair called "Mollwood" after a sensitive weekend, are the second ones that wins four points of the four opening matches throughout the history of the Ryder Cupe.
After they threw Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs test, they were superseded to break the Woods Decorator and the American News Bryson Dechambeau with a even more clear score, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two Saturday mixes, had occasional genius slips, but so far he has lost 19 of the 29 matches on fourballs and foursomes, of which seven were consecutive explosions.
Justin Rose, who was retired during the morning fourballs session, returned with his partner Henrik Stanson in a foursome test and faced him with 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, positions one and three in the world.
However, Europe did not have a course without obstacles on this pleasant and rich day in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a triple winner of major tournaments, and Justin Thomas became the season for Americans, winning two Saturdays.
They succeeded in winning with 2-1 a match against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs test, then came back and faced Poulter and Rory McIllroy with 4 to 3 in the foursome test, after losing the first two holes.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup team managed to recover a four-point deficit in simple tests, though, because they are the current owners of the trophie, Furyk's players need only one equivalent result.
However, after they were on the second floor two days later, a Sunday contraction seemed unlikely.
North Korea says there is no "no chance" to disarmament unilaterally as long as there is no trust
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions would deepen mistrust in the United States and that it is impossible for its country to abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho stated the annual General Assembly of the Global Council that "significant measures to prove good faith" have been implemented in North Korea last year, such as the end of nuclear tests and the testing of missiles, the detonation of nuclear testing site and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we see no corresponding answer from the US," he said.
"If we can't trust the US, we won't trust our national security capabilities and, in such circumstances, we can't defeat the first ones unilaterally."
Although Ri has rejected North Korea's family objectives about the opposition of Washington to a "exhausted" approach to denuclearization, as North Korea would have been rewarded if it had taken steps, its declaration seemed significant because it did not directly reject unilateral denuclearization, as it did the Phoenician in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in a preliminary summit between a U.S. President and North Korea's leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim was committed to making progress towards a "nuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea sought an official end of the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the United States stated that the Phoenician must first abandon his nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington did not apply for relief from the heavy international sanctions imposed by North Korea.
"The US insists on the option "first denuclearization" and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coherent manner, which is actually aimed at "the declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
"The impression that the sanctions can poison us is an illusion that only people don't know us.
But the problem is that the extended sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump referred to by the U.S. leader to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, South Korean President, in the last five months, adding: "If the issue of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to this end."
Even in these circumstances, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from that of last year's speech, when he declared to the United Nations General Assembly that it is inevitable to hold the US territory with rockets from North Korea after "Mr. Malefic" Trump called Kim a "major" in a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, which threatened North Korea last year with "the total destruction", commended Kim for her courage to start the disarmament process, but pointed out that work is just beginning and that sanctions will remain valid until North Korea is denuclearized.
Wednesday, Trump stated that there is no planned period for this and added: "It doesn't matter if it lasts two or three or five months."
China and Russia say that the Phoenician should be paid by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo stated to the United Nations Security Council: "The application of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be valid and without interruption until we obtain complete, final and confirmed denuclearization."
The Security Council has consistently increased the sanctions imposed by North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block funds for the nuclear programmes and for the Palestinian ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri on the colours of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit again the following month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit didn't work too well.
When he left Phenian in July, he said progress had been recorded, but after only a few hours, North Korea reported that it had done "gangsteristic threats".
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has committed itself to building a missile launch band and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "relevant measures".
This said Kim told them that "the appropriate measures" she was looking for were the security guarantees that Trump promised Singapore and that she wanted to normalise her relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking courses on how to get enough rest
A new course from Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the macho culture in growth that makes them subject to learning sessions “all night”, energyed with a lot of caffeine.
One scientist found that, sometimes, students of the most prestigious universities in the world do not even have the basic concepts of the kind in which they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of this type in the United States.
This was inspired to create the course after a conference on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning capacity.
"At the end, a girl came and said to me, 'Why is this to me just now, in the last year?'
She told me she never talked about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she said for The Telegraph.
The course, introduced earlier this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance as well as general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding out that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The course that lasts an hour may involve a series of interactive tasks.
A section presents the picture of a walk room, and students can click on coffee beds, losses, sports pants and books to tell them that these are the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants have been told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily program.
"We know we can't change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that these have the right to know, just as everyone has the right to know what are the effects of smoking on health," adds Professor Czeisler.
The culture that makes students proud to have learned all night is still there, it says, adding that modern technology and pressure imposed on students have transformed sleep into a problem of growth.
The dream, of a good quality, should be a "secret weapon" of a student for combating stress, stress and anxiety, said it, even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain believe that the body is hungry, which makes students feel that they are hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course, after participating in one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
This said that the course opened her eyes and inspired her to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all post-university students to complete a similar study programme before joining this institution where competition is difficult.
Professor Czeisler advised students to program an alarm to know when it is time to sleep, as well as for an hour of wake up, and to know what are the harmful effects of the "white light" emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which may harm the circumcadian rhythm and cause difficulties when it tries to fit in.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's bullet wins Gerrard's team
Rangers suffers from another case of depression moving because Dolly Menga's attack condemned Steven Gerard's inconsistencies at a 1-0 strike in Livingstone.
Ibrox's team wanted to get the first victory in moving from the triumph with 4--1 won in February against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team succeeded in administering Gerard's second 18 games as coach, which put Rangers with eight points after Hearts, the author of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga wrote seven minutes before the break and the uninspired players from Rangers didn't appear in any moment to be equal.
Rangers fell so on the sixth position in class, while Livingston went on the third place, in the Hibernian back, to a difference from one goal.
And Rangers could also face other problems, because the Calum Spence key archipelago had to be treated for a wound at the head level after an object seemed to be thrown into the back of the visiting team.
Gerard has changed eight players from the battalion that has won easy against Ayr in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get a match with Hearts last week and has all the reasons for being proud of the way his ball was well-trained and facing opponents during the game.
Even if Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston used the miles they had.
He should have walked in just two minutes after the game started, when Menga's first step led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's defense gate, but the middleman missed a very good opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free strike found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her to the bar.
Rangers took control, but they left the impression that they hoped more than they believed in their game in the last three years of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed that he should have received a penalty when he kissed Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but the judge Steven Thomson ignored the request of the Colombian.
Rangers just succeeded two hits on the front door, but the former porter from Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was not nearly disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak attack.
Although the 34-minute goal of the Livingstone did not respect the trend of the game, no one can deny that it was worth it, or just for the effort.
Again, Rangers failed to prevent Jacobs' deep center.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent Scott Robinson's mine, which kept her calm and passed on to Menga, who ended up with a simple hit.
Gerard acted on the break when he changed Ryan Kent to Coulibaly; this move almost gave him roade immediately, when the extreme centered on Morelos, but the impressioner Kelly came out of the holes to block him.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors exactly the same type of game he prefers with Lithgov and Halkett who intercepted centers after the center.
Holt's team could've extended the advantage in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' strike, and then Lithgow sent his head over the neck.
Glenn Middleton, booked at Rangers, asked for a penalty at the end of the game, when he hit Jacobs, but again, Thomson didn't agree.
Almanah: the inventor of Geiger's office
And now, a page from our Almanahul Sunday morning: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago (and count count...), is the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that ultimately led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
An essential provision for science since then, Geiger's office has become essential for pop culture, as it happened in the film "Clopotes of San Coronado" (1950), in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played in the role of cowboys with unlikely science trends:
Man: "What else is this?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger account used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you bring these particles, you can hear the effects of radioactive atoms emitted in the minerals."
Evans said, "Yes, I hear a lot of lies!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before he was 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new anti-cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells
A new anti-cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells and destroy them
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
Method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, their transformation into a laboratory
These can "detect" a common protein of many cancers and then are re-injected
A test vaccine provides promising results for patients with cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the harmful ones has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory in such a way that it can "detect" a common protein of many cancers called HER2 and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we make a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "determines the growth of more types of cancer", including blood, ovarians, pulmonary and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, to remove immune cells from patients and to “learn” them to control cancer cells, has also worked for the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a support diaphragm for Trump while wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance at SNL.
He didn't get out too well.
Kanye West was murdered in a study during the Saturday Night Live exhibition after a disillusioned show in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he intends to vote in 2020.
After he played the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Mace American Great hat, the artist was disappointed in a speech against democracy and reaffirmed support for Trump.
“Many times when I talk to a white person, they are asked, ‘How can you like Trump? He's racist’
Well, if I had been worried about racism, I'd have been moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a scene where Matt Damon played, where Hollywood star took over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee on sexual assault charges made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's diatrip film was loaded on the social media of Comrade Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock is trying to take him over the West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems in the basement because of his hat.
"I tried to scare me into college.
They said, "Don't go out wearing this hat."
I've been attacked!
They told me we got very low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how far down I got?" then he said, "I'll get Superman's mansion, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to evolve?
Try with love."
His comments drew Jews from the public at least twice, and SNL team members seemed to be absent, reported Variety; one of the team said to the publication: "In the study a complete silence has been removed."
West was invited as the last hour's replacement for the solitude of Ariana Grande, whom he was loved, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West raised a lot of springs when he played the song I Love it dressed as a Perrier glass.
The West was supported by the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most courageous spirits among us: YOU'RE FRUITED GLOATE."
Karen Hunter, the master of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that the West, simply, "was himself and that's great".
"I choose not to reward anyone (by buying music or clothing or by supporting art) who I think is wearing and expressing a negative ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, declaring that since now it is "the officially known science of Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name; West beat him after Didy, previously known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, was the legend of music, Prince, and changed his name into a symbol and then into "the artist known as Prince's right".
Auxiliary of attempted murder for an incineration in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after another man was shot in a restaurant east of Belfast, January.
The incident took place in Ballyhackmore, the police said.
The defence lawyer is waiting for months before the Belfast Court.
The allegations will be analysed by the Public Prosecutor.
Kit Harington, the star of the thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for Jon Snow's role in the series of violent medieval horrors, produced by HBO.
But 31-year-old actor attacked the macho hero's stereotype, saying that presenting these roles on the screen makes boys think they need to be hard to be respected.
In an interview for The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said it seemed to them that "something went wrong" and wondered how toxic masculinity problem could be managed in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague from the Tournament Office, Rose Leslie, who is 31 years old, acknowledged that she is "very determined" to talk about this problem.
"Personally, I'm very determined to talk about this now: where have I been wrong with masculinity?" he asked.
"What have we taught men about how to be adults, given the problems we are facing now?"
Kit believes that television could be part of the responsibility for increasing male toxicity through very male characters.
He continued: “What is born and learned?
What does it teach young men on TV and on the street, making them think they should be some kind of guy?
I think this is one of the great questions of our times: How can we change this?
'Cause it's clear that something wrong with young people has happened."
In the interview, he recognized that he would not play in any kind of series based on the Tournaments Urseala after the series ended in the spring of the next year, saying that "it ended with war camps and horses".
In November, Kit will play in a new production of the true West theatre by Sam Shepard, who presents the story of a film producer and his brother, who's late.
The actor recently discovered that the best thing that happened to him because of the Orzeala Thrones series was that he met his wife, Rose.
"I knew my wife when I made this series, so this gave me the future of my family and my life before," said Kit.
Rose played in Ygristte's role, beloved Jon Snow, the character played by Kit in the winning fantasy series of many Emmy prizes.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in the number of new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this disease in China, says the authorities.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of the new cases have been transmitted on sexual grounds, especially in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to zero, says the Chinese health authorities responsible for a conference in Yunnan Province.
From one year to another, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered to be very widespread.
Because of the country's conservation values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually get married with a woman.
Many cases of transmission of diseases stem from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs, as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has disclosed the data of the Republican Party's senators, speaks of "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
The representative of Maxine Waters filed on Saturday the charges according to which a member of his team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat in Los Angeles claimed that the charges are made by analysts and websites of "extreme right".
"Miracles, lies and other malicious lies," Waters said in a post on Twitter.
The information published included the addresses and phone numbers of the senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesdays, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as a judge at the Supreme Court.
The leak of information took place shortly after the three senators addressed Kavanaugh's questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was associated with Waters' office and presented information to a member of Waters' team, reported Hill.
"These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie," Waters continued.
‘The member of the team whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false charges was not in any way responsible for misappropriating such information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie."
Waters' statements were criticised online shortly after they were made, including the former Secretary for Press of the Albe House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that he does not have the necessary time to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
It should not be subject to the question of the cause of the accused.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh, criticised by Democrats, who said he seemed a little upset during the March hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican who is running against Waters in the elections from the middle of the mandate, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
"It's important, if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said her office warned "the appropriate legal authorities and entities on these false charges.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be discovered," she continued, "and that they will respond to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any member of my team."
Johnny English Reviews Resuscitate: Paraody without the desire of spy movies, with Rowan Atkinson in the main role
It has become a tradition to look for the meanings associated with Brexito in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film from the series of action films that he has as the main character of Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English.
Could this zeflemishing satire be as strange as we are to become the new opportunity to export the nation?
Anyway, Johnny English, the incompetence spy with the blind eyes and the caucus face, has been renewed for the second time for the license to delete everything. The name of the person means, firstly, that it is a general comical creation for the cinematographic public in the troubled English language countries.
He is, of course, the secret agent who, despite his claims for luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a picture of Mr. Bean and a poem of the type that contributed with a single note on the music theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony from London.
The person is based on the explorer and the mysterious man without the country Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard commercials for TV, which left chaos behind.
This last adventure of JE has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in an environmental armor and the wheels of the rotor hit his suitcase easily.
The gift that Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but the murder is quite weak and, strangely, superfluous, especially because the "serious" films, such as the 007 series or impossible mission, offer reliable comedy moments as an ingredient.
The murder seems to be more directed to children than adults and, to me, Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson's moving movie games when playing in Bean's role.
As usual, the premise is that the Great Britain has serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the British Supersecret Spy Network and has revealed the identity of English agents undercover, to the public service agent's discretion, a minor role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last thing for a prime minister of pump and under-season, who has already suffered a serious crisis due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything he can with his character like Theresei May, but the scenario does not give him a chance to shine.
His consultants in the field of secret information inform him that all active spies have been compromised, so that he must activate an agent found in the reserve.
This is Johnny English's own experience, now working as a teacher in a school for the upper class, which also gives lessons about how to be a cover-up agent. Here are some nice games, because English conducts a spy school in the school of Rock style.
English is brought back to Whitehall, for an emergency seat, then it's together with its weather partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, the role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a little irradiated.
So these Batman and Robin have created their own careers in the Secret Service of His Majesty, they return to action, facing the beautiful dead woman Ophelia Bulletova, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister falls behind a billion-year-old charismatic of the technology industry who claims to be able to solve the IT problems of the British Mari: leftover Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough are starting in a dream of Burleish adventures: buried in caves, fires a French restaurant in fashion, creates chaos when they cross the edge of Volta's luxury vehicle, then English proclaims anarchy in form only when he tries to use a set of glasses for virtual realities to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but regardless of how beautiful and colorful it is, it looks like a television production for children.
A pretty medium-crowd movie.
Like in other movies with Johnny English, I can't stop asking: can't even the British cinema industry give Rowan Atkinson a role to his talent?
The workers deny they're planning to work four days a week, but they're paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would have a radical plan, according to which British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
The party seems to want the heads of companies to benefit from the possible economies due to the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) while giving employees another day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the pay wouldn't have been changed.
The sources say that the idea would "conform" with the party's economic programme, which would lead to a balance in favour of workers.
The four-day work week is supported by the Trade Union Congress in a way that employees can benefit from changing the economy.
A source from the leadership of the Labour Party stated for The Sunday Times: “The announcement of a political review is expected before the end of the year.
It will not happen during the night, but a four-day work week is an appropriate aspirations for the economic rebalanced party in favour of the worker as well as in the overall industry strategy of the party."
The Laborist Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day work week was one of the Green Party's promises in the 2017 campaign for general elections.
However, this ambition is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party stated: "The four-day work week is not a party policy and is not taken into account."
The head of the shadow cabinet, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week's labor conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell stated that it was decided to take back the power from "offside directors" and "professors" from the utility companies.
The master's plans of the shadow cabinet also refer to the fact that current shareholders of the water supply regions could not recover their shares in general because the labor government could understand "deductions" due to identified offences.
It has also confirmed plans to appoint employees in company management councils and to create property funds by which it allocates as much as 10% of its own capital from private-sector companies to employees, which will receive such annual dividends up to approximately 500 litres.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in the "60 Minutes" show if Kavanaugh's investigation by the FBI would make him reflect
The FBI's investigation of the charges brought by Judge Brett Kavanaugh has doubled the final vote on his candidates as a judge in the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the Republican senators might be convinced that he no longer supports the findings of the FBI.
In a broadcast interview on Sunday, the "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make him reflect.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said this from the beginning of the hearings; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges appeared and I asked him, "Are you guilty?"
The answer was decided, immediately, without fault."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be on the rock.
"I am determined with regard to Brett Kavanaugh, so there would be some explosive charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejects the charges with a decision," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘None of the persons named by it has confirmed the report.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt something's gonna change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has succeeded in doing something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that will be attended by an impressive group of stars, with a mission such as an impressive: the eradication of world poverty.
In addition to the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will attract tens of thousands of people on Central Park Square, not only to follow artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to increase the level of awareness of the real meaning of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international legal group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket at the event (except where they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the spectators had to buy from a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, making phone calls or other significant things that would help increase the level of awareness of global poverty eradication.
But what happened to the Global Citizen Festival when I am only 12 years old to reach the goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism", a concept that refers to people who feel they have done something by signing an online request or by sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, more than 19 million "actions" have been recorded in 2011 by its supporters, which have promoted different objectives.
The organization says these actions have inspired world leaders to announce commitments and policies with a value of more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group spoke of 390 commitments and announcements due to its actions, which at least $10 billion had already been spent or abroad.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership with the headquarters in the British Sea of investors and intermediaries who have committed themselves to "help children grow up to their full potential", which has promised Rwanda $35 million to contribute to the elimination of malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4700 messages on Twitter from global citizens.
"With the help of the British government of Mary, donors, national governments and other global citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in the history book," said Tracey Ulman, Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, in front of many during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it will finance the The Power of Nutrition project, which will ensure nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most common questions on their website: "What makes you believe you can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and make mistakes.
However, as great movements for civil rights or anti-partids that took place before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae is among the artists who will sing this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the ship forces for a "block" to gather Russian energy exports, says the Secretary of the Interior.
Washington may, "if necessary", appeal to the shipping forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, revealed US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's commitment to Syria, in particular where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why I am in the Middle East is that I want to interfere with the sale of energy, as I do in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe," she said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways and means of managing the situation.
"The United States has the ability, through our ship's forces, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade so that energy does not go into the market," he said.
Zinke is addressed to participants at an event led by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that states "the voice of the energy consumer" in the U.S.
This continued by comparing how Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practical.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels," he said about Russia, saying "it knows one trick" because of the fossil fuel-dependent economy.
Statements came at a time when the Trump administration was trying to increase exports of natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the most efficient option for European consumers.
In this sense, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "independence" project of North Stream 2, which, according to Trump, would transform Berlin into a "prison" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed the fact that the 11 billion-dollar North Stream 2 project will double the capacity of the existing pipeline, 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin stated that the fierce opposition of the US towards the project is promoted for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we see things the same way: energy cannot be a pressure instrument and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, Minister of Energy in Russia after a meeting with Rick Perry, Secretary of Energy of the United States in Moscow in September.
The US position drew critics from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The principal industrial organisation of Germany, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the fact that a third state is involved in matters of our energy," said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "thinks seriously" to apply to the 2020 presidential elections, says Senator from Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, said Saturday that he must "think seriously" if he can vote in the presidential elections after the election from the middle of the mandate.
During the first meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he took into account a candidate.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our tight government, and for that there is a need for a strong woman," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously think if I can vote in the presidential elections."
Warren had something to say about President Donald Trump during the first meeting, saying that it "adjusted the country in a wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate named by it for the Supreme Court.
In a message posted on Twitter yesterday, Warren said "we normally need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a survey published by Joi showed that most of Warren's voters do not think they should apply in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters from Massachusetts said that the senator should not apply, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirteen and two per cent of respondents support such a candidate.
The poll showed more support for an ex-governing candidate, Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidate and 48% are against.
Other names of well-known democracies that could be applied in 2020 are those of Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Biden said he will decide officially until January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post traumatic stress syndrome she suffers from Track Palin at a meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after she was born in September.
Last night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
"The things that pass through my own son, through which he passed after he came back... I can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress syndrome and the consequences of the injuries our soldiers are returning," said the public gathered for a meeting of support from Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest of this "capital elephant" and said that her son and other war veterans "are back a little different, harder, wondering whether there is more respect for what they and their troops from the armed forces and aircraft, as well as all the other members of the Army, have done for the country".
This was held in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of domestic violence and the possession of a fire weapon in Hebrew status, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman of the Department of Police in Wasilla.
18 states and the Colombian District answer a new asylum application policy
Eighty states and the Columbia District support a legal challenge to the new US politicians who refuse to grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape from the violence caused by finding or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and District have completed a friendly Friday's petition in Washington to support a policy challenge on asylum seekers, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions process which the American Civil Liberties Union organisation launched in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and her violent sons, members of a find", abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The so-called State attorney representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produced a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, to nations facing a generalized problem with domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has rejected a 2014 Council Decision on the Call for Migrants, which has allowed immigrants without acts that try to escape domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine stated yesterday that the new policy " ignores the decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"The Federal Law states that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such limitation violates this principle," writes a friend curiae.
In addition, lawyers argue that the policy that refuses immigrants affects the US economy, saying it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "give the necessary labour force".
Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney General, ordered in June the judges for cases of immigration not to agree with the victims who are trying to escape abuse and violence.
"The asylum is granted to those who leave their country under persecution or fear because of discrimination based on race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or because of a political opinion," said Sessions on 11 June, when he announced policy.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems facing people in the world every day, or even all the serious problems.
Save operations unexpected in Palu, where the number of dead has doubled, in a run against timeframe to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become increasingly serious.
"The situation seems very tense," said Risa Kusumuma, a 35-year-old mother, who has been putting her baby away in February at an evacuation centre in the city of Palu.
"The ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is not enough."
The residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their wells, trying to save everything they could save.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude of 7.5 on Richter scale, were overstated.
Some of the wounds, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures in the vertebral and ummeral column, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients are treated in free air due to strong and continuous responses.
It has eyes full of tears when she remembers how she felt the violent shock blowing up the hotel room from the fifth floor that she shared with her wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the ruins of the wall, I think," said Haris for Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a bride.
"I heard my wife crying for help, then just calm down.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope I'm safe."
U.S. Ambassador accused China of "abuse" of "propagandistic advertising"
A week after an official newspaper from China published a four-page statement in a US daily praising the mutual benefits of trade exchanges between the US and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American press to distribute advertising material.
US President Donald Trump referred to the supplement paid by China to Des Moines Register, the best selling newspaper from Iowa, after he accused China of joining the 6 November Congress elections, a charge that China rejects.
The claim that Beijing is trying to join the US elections marked what U.S. officials have said to Reuters that it is a new phase in a Washington scale campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a growing trade war, which involves increasing import tariffs.
The prices imposed by China as a result, at the beginning of the commercial war, were created to affect such exporters as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, experts from China and the US said.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States of America in China and was governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing has hurt US workers, farmers and business people.
In a Sunday edition published in Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China "keeps this abuse by publishing advertising advertisements in our own free press".
"When spreading propaganda by publishing a statement in Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect the tradition of freedom of expression and free press in America," says Branstad.
"In exchange, at the street newspaper shop in Beijing you will find few voices of the dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent views that Chinese citizens have about China's worrying economic traction, since the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," she writes.
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what paper is about.
The Republicans align sex female voters before the election from the middle of the mandate due to the Kavanaugh scandal, warn analysts
Because many of the top republicans support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, from more sexual abuse charges, analysts have warned that there will be a conflict, especially among women, during the next elections from half the mandate.
The emotions created by this scandal were extremely powerful, and most of the Republicans who have discussed this with the public intend to continue the vote.
"So the reactions will not be forgotten," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he has doubts that the recent initiative of Senator Jeff Flake (the representative of Arizona) on a FBI investigation will calm the angry electorate.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday, will not forget tomorrow and will not forget in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and spokesman for the national group, according to Washington, D.C.
Tomorrow morning, the protesters were scanning "Come November!" while they demonstrated on the Senate halls when the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Ethnosis and the motivation of democracy will be very great," said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst who is not involved in the news site.
"People say they were already very big and that's true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the six-month-old women's indigenous voters from the suburban and the young electorate, between 18 and 29 years of age, who, although not joining the president, still does not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed allegations of sexual abuse brought the nominalist to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that it might be counterproductive if the Republicans continued the confirmation process.
"This has been transformed into an excuse for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, who was president of the National Committee of the Republican, at the beginning of last week, according to NCB News.
"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote or the opportunity for Kavanaugh to be confirmed, but also how the Republicans dealt with this situation and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities, an electoral support group for the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be relatively divided about the party that should believe it after Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony: a bit more likely to believe it later.
A new survey conducted by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents believe with courage or believe it is likely that Ford's testimony was true, while 35% said that she believed with courage or that it is likely Kavanaugh's testimony to be true.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh lied, probably or safely, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made an oath before the Senate's judicial committee that Kavanaugh abused her in her Hebrew status at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nomination to the Supreme Court exposed the genital organs in front of her when she participated in a party while they were students at Yale in 1980.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to create a new Internet to compete on Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launchs a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest legend project in the field of technology, Inrupt, is a solid-based company, open-source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "global domination".
"Now we have to do it," he said about startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal data archives" or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional instruments.
It is also like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available in one browser, all from one time.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this "personal data-consolidation".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea is to contribute with adequate resources, processes and skills, in such a way as to make Solid available to all the world.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM purchased security platform, a team of developers working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team do not speak with "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce or not a complete change when their business models are fully given over once.
"We won't ask permission."
In a Saturday post published on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even after Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this being the next Internet," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: the clergy who won the Victoria Cross in World War I is celebrated
The only cleric of the Church of England who won a medal Crucea Victoria right to fight in World War I was celebrated in its homeland after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack from Bellenglishe and Lehacourt.
It was killed by a lunarist four days later and never knew it was the highest military honor of Brittany.
A monumental stone was erected on Saturday by the two of you during the Rushden paradise in Northamptonshire.
One of the nepots, Michael Vann, said it's "symbolicly past" the fact that the stone will be developed exactly 100 years after the fact that its grandfather won the medal.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led the battalion over the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very high hour and under the intense fire of artillery and metals".
Later, he quickly arrived at the line first and, with "a fantastic bravado", opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked a single box of artillery and managed to eliminate three of the weapons of destruction.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German lunarist on 4 October 1918, only one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said his grandfather's actions were "a thing I know I will never be equal to, but that makes me feel bad."
This, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a post-paradise crown, which was led by Orchestra of Lieutenant Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said "it feels very honored to play a role in the paradise" and added that "the value of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that many people agree with".
The MMA fans stayed all night to see Bellator 206, but they got animated drawings with Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine that you've been following Bellator 206, an event with many old ones all night long, just so you can't follow the main event.
The San Jose event program contained 13 wars, including six on the main panel, and had to be broadcast alive all night in the British Sea on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi was preparing to meet Rory MacDonald, British spectators were surprised when the transmission was replaced by an episode from Peppa Pig.
Some have not been very grateful, because they've been three all night looking forward to the fight.
A fan described Twitter's transition to the animated drawing for children's right "a kind of stupid joke".
"The government regulations say this content is not appropriate for 6 a.m., so they had to change to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, vice-president of Bellator for marketing and communication when he was asked about transmission.
"The Percussion Peppa, yes."
Scott Cooker, president of Bellator's company, said that in the future they will program their events in such a way that they can be followed by British spectators.
"When I think about the clocks, I think we could probably solve," said Cooker.
"But it's 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday day here and we won't be able to do this until Sunday, our hour, or the month, their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, I thought it was a technical improvement.
But it wasn't about this, it was about a government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to sum up five wars instead of six, as we usually do, and we've tried to offer more fans and we've gone beyond the limit.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of sexuality
Olympic explorer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling that he is inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sport said it only happened when it arrived at school that "not everyone is like me".
Invited to the first exhibition Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, she said she was talking about gay people's rights to give them another "hope".
The sport also said that when he became a parent, he missed less than the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the usual presentation of traditional emissions, will be missing a few months because of a disease.
In the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child he felt "lower" to others because "he was not socially acceptable to me to like boys and girls."
He said: "To date, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different have been the real things that gave me the strength and resilience to achieve success."
He wanted to prove he's "someone," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when he finally finds out about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympic Games became a well-known supporter of the LGBT campaigns and took advantage of this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to request more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
This said she decided to speak because she felt lucky that she could live free, without any trace, and because she wanted to give the other "hope".
The World Championship trip said "was taken by surprise" because she loved a man, American Dustin Lance Black.
Darley married last year to the Oscar award winner, who is 20 years older than he was, but he said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a fragile age," he participated in the first Olympic when he was only 14 years old, and his father died of cancer after three years - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who would have passed through the same good and bad times.
The two became, in June, the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, who, says Daley, changed his "all-seeing" perspective.
"If I had been asked last year, I wouldn't have been interested in anything but winning a gold medal," she said.
“You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympic Games.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with cerebral cancer.
Daley said his father didn't agree that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted to find out if he received tickets for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, because he wanted to be first.
"I couldn't tell him "You couldn't be first," he said.
"I held him by hand when he stopped breathing and soon after he stopped breathing and died I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that I had dreamed of a whole life, going before my country's spectators at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired him in his choice of music, Proud de Heather Small, which encouraged him before the Olympic Games and still stirs him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 p.m.
Mickelson, out of shape, was transferred to the savings bank on Saturday, in Cupa Ryder.
American Phil Mickelson will set up a Saturday record when he will play in the fourteenth and the seven games of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to return to a good shape so that it will not be an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who plays in the binary event for the second time, another record, was transferred to Captain Jim Furyk's reserve bank for fourballs and Saturday's fours.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as was many times for the United States team, the winner won the major tournament and shared the day between being larger for the crew and having their successes, with the hope that he will correct what was wrong.
The 48-year-old player never had the most right drivers, not even in the best period of his career, so it's not the best choice for the Le Golf National field, where the long-distance roughs sometimes bring the wrong hits.
And if the land is not a major provocation, in the ninth game of the Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the British Open championship methico, which has joined the news Tommy Fleetwood and won all the four matches of the week.
Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial for Americans, led by four points at the entrance into the 12 simple mixes, which must start in force at this stage.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player's ability, but he couldn't have said anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, beat me on the shoulder, dressed me and told me he'd be ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
"There are many confidences in him.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play in two matches.
I thought more, but that's what happened, and that's the way I thought we had to go.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
Tomorrow, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for most of the games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the end of his career in Cupa Ryder, which has no longer risen to the level of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 winning matches, 20 lost and seven percent, although Furyk said his presence has brought some inestimable advantages to the team.
"It's fun, it's tough, smart, she likes to play with players, it's a great guy in the team dresser," he explained.
"I think young players are having fun playing with him, it was fun to see them doing this during the week.
His role is more important, not just at the game."
Captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that considerable progress could soon disappear
Mr. Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that the considerable progress made before the first day of simple trials in the Ryder Cup can easily be transformed into an unpleasant journey.
Danes started in the 1997 Valderama game, when the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans with five points, but only if he managed to face them with a minimum difference from 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
"I remember having a considerable advance in Valderram; I had a great progress in Brooklyn, where I lost, and in Valderram, where I almost won," said Bjorn (in image) after following the 2018 team, who won 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, and now runs 10-6 on Le Golf National.
"So history shows me, me and my team, that it's not ready yet.
We have to play at the maximum speed tomorrow.
Let's get out of the field and do everything perfect.
The game is not ready until the points are pasted on the table.
We have a purpose and this is to win this trophie, this must remain the target.
I've always said, we have to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we know what's waiting for us on the other side: the best players in the world."
Impressed by the way his players worked on a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I don’t rush to draw conclusions.
It's all different tomorrow.
Tomorrow are important individual performances, and this is different.
It's great to be on the ground with a partner when things go well, but when you're on your own, then you're tested to the maximum, like a golf player.
This is the message you have to send to players, that it must be in the best form tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and they have to play as well as I can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, captain of the opposite team, hopes that his players will play better on the simple test than they did with the partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was from both sides of the same return on the last day: he was in the Brooklyn winning team, then in the desert when Europe succeeded "the miracle of Medina".
"With every word in mind," she answered when she was asked how Ben Crenshaw, Captain of 1999, managed to encourage players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick victories, such as at Brooklyn, like at Medina.
When the tension develops in a direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those mixes from the middle.
We created the appropriate battalion and ordered the players as we wanted, you know, we're trying to create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the war: he will face Rory McIllroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans from the second half of the programme.
"I have chosen this group of players, in this order, because I think it covers all the subjects," Bjorn said about the battalion for simple proof.
The new German war vehicle, re-commenced
The newest task of Germany's shipping forces should have been put into effect in 2014 to replace the warships of the Red War, but this will only happen in the year, due to the weak systems and growth costs, has reported local pressure.
The entry into operation of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship, a ship of the new Baden-Wuertemberg cargo class, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, who reads a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been introduced into the maritime forces in 2014, but after delivery problems affected this project ambitiously.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuertemberg class that Marina Military ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class cargoes.
It is expected that these will be provided with a strong tone, with a range of anti-air and anti-vasive rockets, as well as steel technology, which ensures a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic pressure.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for new requirements to be able to leave missions for two years without returning to the original port.
However, the delays continue to mean that these weapons of war of the last generation, which is said to increase Germany's maritime strength, will be already ageed before entering service, notes Die Zeit.
Ghinionist F125 was discussed in the press last year when the German military Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the port of Blohm & Voss from Hamburg.
This was the first time Marina Military returned a construction car after delivery.
There is not much information available about the reasons for refusal, but the media in Germany have quoted a number of "software and hardware defects" that would have made the weapon of war useless in a war mission.
The software defects were particularly important because the Baden-Wuertemberg class vessels will be operated by a team of about 120 sailors, only half of the teams of older crews in Bremen class.
In addition, it has been shown that the vessel had too much weight, which reduced its performance and limited the capacity of the military Navy to add future equipment.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton vessel "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as difficult as the German vessels used in the Second World War.
Alongside the failed mechanisms, and the whole project price, including team training, has become a cause for concern.
It is said that this has reached the latest figure of EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), from the original price of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of the new ones are of particular importance in view of the latest warnings that say Germany's maritime power is declining.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the military Navy "has begun to remain empty which could be sent to missions".
The officer stated that the problem has grown steadily over time, as old vessels have been removed from function without being replaced with some of us.
This has led to the fact that none of the requirements of the Baden-Wuertemberg class have entered into force within the Military Sea.
National Trust spys on the secret life of the bears
New research carried out on a property in Scottish Highlands will reveal how to use the surrounding environment to win the prize.
It is hoped that the discoveries will reveal new things about the behavior of these flying mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study of National Trust for Scotland's scientists will analyze the common smallpox and pigment lilacs, as well as the eardrum and water lilacs from the Inverwe Mountains of Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be extended to key locations around the property to monitor the activity of the lichens during the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will carry out mobile studies using manual detection.
The specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by lilacs and what species emit certain sounds.
A map of the apartment and a report will also be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour in the environment.
Rob Dewar, an consultant on conservation of nature for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitats are the most important for lilacs and how they are used for each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of the housing management work, such as the creation of gas, which is the best way to keep forest landscapes and other associated species.
The populations of lilicas from Scotland and throughout the British Empire have fallen considerably in the last century.
These are dangers of construction and development work that affects the backyards, but also the loss of the apartment.
And oil turbines and public lighting are risks, as are muscle caps and some chemical treatments for construction materials, but also domestic fish attacks.
Actually, the wolves aren't Orbits.
However, due to the fact that they're spending the night, the ears are more useful than the eyes when it's about taking the breath.
They use a sophisticated ecosystem technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight route.
NTSC, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is very serious about lily.
These have ten trained experts who carry out periodic studies, control their backs and sometimes carry out rescue missions.
The organisation has created the first and only spare spare parts of Scotland, on the Thareve bridge in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of lilac are found in Scotland.
The husband's manager, David Thompson, says that this is the ideal area for lilacs.
"Here, at Thrave, the area is wonderful for the lily," he says.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old kids and a perfect apartment.
But there are many things we don't know about lilaces, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need to multiply."
This underlines the importance of looking for lilacs before performing maintenance work on property, since simple unintended destruction of a maternal cow could kill up to 400 women and dogs, which can destroy the entire local population.
The lieries are protected, and killing, killing or stopping them, as well as destroying their bodies, are prohibited actions.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer in Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the audience to help him.
It said: "We still have a lot to learn about lilacs and we don't know how populations evolve for many of our species."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers are preparing to give the German magazine in court
Christian Ronaldo said the charges against him are "fake news" and that some people "will complain" using his name.
Her lawyers are determined to give the German newspaper Der Spiegel in court, which published the charges.
The attack by Portugal and the Youth team was accused of violating an American woman, identified by Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the football player paid her $375.000 to not talk about the accident.
A few hours after the charges were published, in a video clip broadcast on Instagram Live for 142 million of her followers, Ronaldo, aged 33, said they are "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today are fake news," said the winner of the Gold Balloon in front of the video room.
"I want to make a complaint using my name.
It's normal.
They're gonna get me famous using my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to give trial Der Spiegel because of these charges, which they have called "an unacceptable report of suspicions of private life," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player will demand disadvantages for "equivalent moral damage with an adequate amount for the seriousness of the fact, which is likely one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009, in an apartment from the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a club, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's room, where it violated anal, according to documents from the Clark District Court Committee in Nevada.
Majorga claims that, after the incident, Ronaldo fell in his face and said he was "a good boy" in proportion to "99%", and that he was betrayed by that "a percentage".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the defendant, but that they were consensus.
Majorga claims that she was addressed to the police and that her injuries were taken to the hospital, but she later accepted an understanding outside the courtroom because she was "territated by the possibility of a confrontation" and was concerned that "will be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to cancel that understanding because she continues to be traumatized by an accident.
At the time of the attack he was accused, Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain "will regret the loss of car manufacturers"
Britain's Great "will regret it" if it loses the status of the world's leader in the production of cars after Brexit, Secretary for Business Greg Clark said.
It added that it is "frequency" because Toyota UK has declared to the BBC that if the British Great comes out of the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border in case of an unaccompanied Brexit could cost jobs.
The company from Burnaston, where Auris and Avenis brands are manufactured in Toyota, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My advice is that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston, said.
Other UK car producers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they were afraid of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the factory from Oxford where the Mini model has been produced for a month.
The main concerns are what manufacturers consider to be risks associated with the supply chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line works on the basis of the "fix in time" principle: for machines manufactured on the command, the pieces arrive at an interval of 37 minutes from the suppliers of the British Sea and the EU.
If the British Sea leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be problems at the border which, according to industrial producers, could lead to delays and loss of share.
It would be impossible for Toyota to deposit more than the inventory for one day at her Derbyshire factory, says the company, so the production would be stopped.
Clark said that the May Cheese Chequers plan for future EU relations is "calibrated precisely to avoid these delays at the border".
"There must be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will enable us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence from Toyota not only shows that we must continue to use what was a successful supply chain set."
Toyota could not specify how long the production would have to stop, but warned that increased prices could reduce the long-term competitive capacity of the factory and ultimately lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who works at 24-year-old Burnaston and is responsible for the United Union trade union, said that members are increasingly concerned: "The experience has taught me that, after disappearing, these jobs will no longer return."
A government spokesman said: "I have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein might be breakfast yesterday, says Casa Alba.
The high-level meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could be "more than one week" because the battle for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, continued, declared the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who invests Russian interference in the elections, links between Trump's and Russia's aid and the potential to obstruct justice by the President.
The calls about the possibility that Trump might grant him to the Deputy Attorney General, thus endangering Mueller's independence, circled in Washington's monthly circles.
At the beginning of the month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through Amendment 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last month he went to the White House, and the reports say he was about to give up.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced for Joi at the United Nations headquarters at the time.
Trump said he "would rather not" grant Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the Senate's legal committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, filed witnesses.
Friday, Trump asked for a week's FBI investigation regarding the charges against Kavanaugh, which repeated the vote in the Senate's plenary.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It has not been established once in this sense; it may be this week or it may be a week, taking into account all the other things that are now being done at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll always like to keep the press on the current."
Some reporters would answer this claim: Sanders no longer had a press briefing at the White House on September 10th.
Mr. Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that reducing the number of briefings was not caused by antipathy against TV reporters, which they liked to do in the show, although he added: "Don't deny that they like to be in the show."
Then he suggested that the direct contact between Trump and press be increased.
"The Presidents participate in more questions and answers than all previous presidents," she said, adding without saying any evidence: "I have analyzed the figures."
"I want more briefings," Sanders said further, "but I think it's much better that the press have the opportunity to address the questions directly to the President of the United States, not me.
We are trying to do this many times and you have noticed that we have done this many times in the last few weeks, and discussions with the Presidents of the United States will replace press briefings when this is available."
Normally, Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open meetings or press conferences with the protesters who visit him.
The only agreed press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, having an improvised appearance on church halls in front of the reporters assembled.
A State Secretary of the Ministry of Health addressed in a letter to EU employees from the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland on Brexit related concerns
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their appreciation for the country's name and the wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Parliament of Scotland, sent the letter under less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to support the costs of applications for permanent residence status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter Freeman wrote: "In the course of the truth, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, waiting for decisions to be taken in this autumn.
But the United Kingdom Government has begun to prepare as much as possible for a different scenario, in which there would be no agreement on EU exit.
I know it's a very stressful period for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Members of the European Union, but also outside them, have a valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also bring benefits to patients and the communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is subjected to an emergency surgery after she suffered a head stroke
The Foundation of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after a Saturday attack, in which his team lost him in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores team, with the score of 31-27, declared Mike Organ from Tennessee.
The main trainer of the Tennessee State team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the strike took place shortly before the break.
"It's reached the roof line and it's just gone off," Reed said.
Abercrombie has been given an oxygen mask by physical manufacturers and medical personnel, on the roof line, before sitting on a market and transporting it from the ground for a detailed assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV from Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of the operation that she was subjected to at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no details about the type/extension of the accident" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a student in the second year, is in his first season in Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
Saturday, it managed to make five total games before leaving the game, reaching a number of 18 games throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will receive a higher legal tax on the purchase of a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will pay a higher legal tax on the purchase of property in the United Kingdom, following the use of additional money to help people without delay, in accordance with the new plans of the Conservative Party
This change will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young people with a right to vote
Court of First Instance shall apply to persons who are not tax-paying and who are tax-taxed in the United Kingdom
The treasure is expected to stretch up to 120 million sterline lires per year for the help of people without help
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher rate of court tax for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help people without delay, as announced today Theresa May.
The change will be considered an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's successful efforts to attract young people with a right to vote, promising homes with more favourable prices and seeing people with large incomes.
The higher court rate will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not taxable and taxable in the United Kingdom, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the Government's efforts to help people without delay.
The ceiling, which is added to the current court rate of stamp, including the higher levels after two years for the second property and the properties purchased for the purpose of rent, could reach a 3% value.
The treasure is expected to bring this change to a plus up to 120 million sterline readings per year.
About 13% of new properties built in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which leads to price growth and makes it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
More prosperous areas of the country, especially capital, have become "fangoma villages" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend a large part of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks ago when Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the court tax to help young people buy their first home.
This accused large construction firms that they maintain high property prices as a result of land purchases without using them and asked Theresei May to give up tax rates for affordable houses in order to solve "house problems" in the British Sea.
Corbyn announced a series of attractive reform proposals in the real estate area, including control over the rents and halting unmovable evacuations.
He also wants to offer them stronger advice on building new houses.
Theresa May stated: “Last year I stated that I would devote my first mandate to the fulfillment of British life, a better life for every new generation.
And this means remedying existing problems on the real estate market.
The Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign-owned companies, to be able to buy homes as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a house has become a very distant one, and life under adverse conditions is too real."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to be the head of Scotland's national team"
Jack Ross, manager of the Sunderland football team, said that "his final goal" is to become, at one point, the national team manager of Scotland.
The Scottish, at 42 years of age, enjoys the "reinvia" of the North-East Club, which is currently located at 3rd place in the First League, with a difference of three points in front of the first place.
This evening he moved to the Luminian Stadium team after he succeeded, last season, the return of the St. Mirren football team to the first Scottish Premiership division.
"I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
I got to National B team and about that," Ross for Sports Sound at BBC Scotland said.
"But I spent a lot of childhood following Scotia's matches at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will only have part of this opportunity if I succeed as the club manager."
Among Ross's predecessors, as manager of the Sunderland Club, is Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt and Paulo Di Canio.
The former director of the Alloa Athletic Club said he did not feel like he was the successor of such dedicated names and at a club so important, after he rejected offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"The only thing I care about and that could affect my success is the question "Can I help this team come back to Premier League?"
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow it to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to contribute to the return of the club to the Premier League."
Ross has only three years of experience in driving, after a period in which he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the Hearts training staff.
Then he helped the Alla club come back after he was retrograded in Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from retrogradation, helping the team win the championship title in the following season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a decisive moment," he said about taking the lead in the Allaa club.
"I really thought I deserved the manager's role more than the player.
It may sound strange, because we had a good time, we won well and we had some success moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I'm faced with situations like manager, with regard to stress and pressure, but I feel it's a proper role for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I can do this, I feel it's the best thing I've ever had in my adult life."

The ideal time to drink a half beer is Saturday, at 17:30, according to a Sunday
The heat value of this summer led to an increase in the revenue in British villages, but there was more pressure on restaurants.
According to figures, villages and bars have recorded an increase of 2.7% in July, while restaurants' income dropped by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a representative of the CGA, who provides business consultancy services and conducted the survey, said: “The constant heat and participation of England in the World Cup for a longer period than the predicted has contributed to a type in July, similar to the previous month, when the population recorded up to 2.8% more customers, while restaurants had a worse period.
The number of customers decreased by 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June and more in July.
Flowers and bars that serve only drinks have recorded a much larger benefit than restaurants.
And the people who serve food have recorded heat loss, but not as large as the restaurants.
Looks like people got out of town just to consume drinks.
Drinking sales at all levels of bars and pipes increased by 6.6% this month, and food recorded a fall by 3%."
Paul Newman, a representative of RSM who provides services in the hospital industry, said: “These results continue to be the trend I have observed since the end of April.
The meteorological conditions and impact of the sporting and social enlargement events remained among the most important factors contributing to the sales of the OOH advertising market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to record losses, although the decline in sales of 4.8% per year will add to current cost pressures.
The long canycular barrier could not come at a much lower point for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news."
The increase in total sales of flowers and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the low number of newly launched sites.
The company that monitors the sale of beans, bars and restaurants from the United Kingdom, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over 9 billion pounds of esterline, being the official standard of the industry.
One of the five children has a secret account on a socializing network they hide from their parents.
According to a survey, one of five children, some even up to 11 years old, has a secret account on a social networking network that is hidden by parents and teachers.
A survey conducted at the level of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "insta's false accounts"
Knowledge has increased the fears of sex-containing posts
20% of students said they have a "principal" account that shows parents
One of five children, some even up to 11 years of age, creates an account on a social networking network that keeps him hidden from adults.
A survey conducted on a number of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the “insta fake” accounts, referring to the Instagram photo sharing platform.
Knowledge has increased the fears of sex-containing posts.
20% of the students said they had a "primary" and "kult" account shown to their parents, but they also had other private accounts.
A mother who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account noted the post of a teenager who asked for "violent".
According to research conducted by the Digital Awarenss company of the United Kingdom and the HMC – Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference of Independent Schools, 40% of young people aged between 11 and 18 have two profiles and half of them have recognized that they have secret accounts.
HMC's director, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers don't have access."
Elidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in the Committee of the Athletics of Scotland
Elidh Doyle was elected as director, without executive power, of the Scotland Athletics Commission, during the annual general meeting of the steering body.
Doyle is the most beautiful field and track in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, President, described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions about sports to benefit from the vast experience it has gained at international level in the last decade.
"She is enjoying respect for the entire association of athletes from Scotland, the British Sea, as well as around the world and we are sure that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits once they are included in the Commission," Beattie said.
Doyle added: "I am happy that I could represent the athletes and hope to have a real contribution and to help the way sports activities are carried out in Scotland."
The American Nationality Championship, which won the 200- and 400-metre samples at the Atlantic Games in 1996, along with the four gold medals won at the Olympic Games, is now a frequent commentator at BBC, has become invalid after a transversive schemic attack.
It wrote on Twitter: “A month later, I suffered a brain attack.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will decide whether or not I'll recover.
It was a titanic job, but I recovered completely, I learned to go back, and today I'm doing my agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Advertisement on blood pumps comparing women with cows divides public opinion online
A blood pumping company has caused public opinion to be divided online with a advertising that compares mothers who are dealing with cows' mulging.
In order to mark the launch of a pump that wants to be "the first silent and portable pump in the world", Elvie's consumer technology company launched an ironic advertising, inspired by a music video clip, to present the freedom that the new pump offers to mothers who adapt.
Four real moms dance in a room full of beds for cows on a melody that includes verses such as "Yes, I am tired, but I don't have a code" and "If you haven't noticed, these are not candles, but my blood."
The reference goes on: "I pump, pump, catch the baby, pump, pump, extract the milk from the girls."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has eliminated controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video clip was held with mixed reactions from those who had seen it, many of them saying it was thrown out of the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and be born to produce milk, except that children are stolen only a few days from birth," wrote one person.

Another person commented: “It is understandable how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why don't we use them to promote a blood pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "It's an extremely inappropriate complaint."
Other people have appeared to the ad, a person claiming to have appeared to them a "silar" ad.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if we were still hunting.
The pumping really made me feel like a wolf.
The ad is a bit inappropriate, but I took it like that.
But the product is great," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “It’s an amusing announcement to mothers who use pumps (often at work or in toilets) and who feel like ‘ cucumbers’.
It's not a commercial that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video clip, the group of women reveals that they have danced with discreet pumps introduced into the suite.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use pumps say they feel like vaccinators.
But Elvie pump is completely silent, does not have horns or tubes and fits discreetly in a shelter, offering women free movement, the possibility of holding their children in their arms and even going out of town while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, a partner, consultant and developer in Mother’s project, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a ridiculous and provocative launch.
Compared to mothers who are lactating and milk cows, we wanted to highlight what it means to use a blood pump and the challenges in this sense, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible sense of freedom that will give him the new pump.
It's not the first time Elvie's pump gets on the first page.
During the presentation of fashion creator Marta Jakubowski on the London fashion week, the mother of two children appeared on the platform while using the product.
Hundreds of children have been transferred to hiding in a refugee camp at the border with Texas.
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although the number of persons crossing the border each month has remained relatively similar, mostly because the rhetoric and difficult policies introduced by the Trup administration have caused the confusion of the procedure for placing children in sponsors.
Usually, many sponsors are themselves immigrants without documents and fear that they will endanger their country's seat if they are asked to take children.
The risks increased in June when the federal authorities announced that sponsor potentials, as well as other adult members of the family, must register their printers and that their data will be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement officer, announced before the Congress that the agency arrested ten persons who requested the sponsorship of minors.
Furthermore, the Agency confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no previous penalties.
"About 80% of the sponsors or members of the sponsors' family live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign offenders.
Which means we'll continue to look for the individuals in question," Albence said.
In order to accelerate the procedure for the processing of children, the authorities have introduced new rules, which require children to be present at the time of one month of detention, and not 60 days as provided for by the previous standard, in accordance with the requirements of adaptive workers.
Many will plead for the case through a video call, and not personally before a judge of immigration, to request the status of legal residence.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The more children stay in custody, the more they may become indifferent or depressed, which may lead to violent or attempted eviction reactions, according to the employees of the appointments and reports issued by the system in the last few months.
Lawyers have stated that these concerns are accentuated at a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is the possibility of signs indicating that a child has problems are not observed, due to the size of the unit.
They added that the transfer of children to the refugee camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to take good care of their friends could cause them trauma, which many of them already suffer.
Syria asks US, French and Turkish military forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam asked Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria was in the war for eight years.
Moulalem, who is also the prime minister of the interim, said that foreign military forces are illegally located in a Syrian territory under the pretext of combating terrorism and that "the situation will be properly managed".
"This must be withdrawn immediately and without any condition," he said during the meeting.
Moulalem insisted on the fact that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of people have been displaced from their homes.
It further stated that Damascus will continue "this holy war until we abandon terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories".
In Syria there are about 2,000 military troops in the United States, which are particularly involved in training and consulting the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
There are also more than 1,000 French military troops in the country affected by the war.
With regard to the refugee problem, Moualem stated that there were good conditions for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading ironic fears", as it determined refugees to maintain their distance.
It added: "I have asked for the support of the international community and of humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return."
"I have brought political influence into a problem that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war is established.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to expand the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has contributed to the avoidance of a large-scale asylum with the help of the Russians, supported by the Russians, over the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed the fact that the agreement has a "clear deadline" and expressed the hope that the military action will target the Jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, who have links to the Al-Qaeda network and who "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, United Nations emissary, hopes to meet soon in the first sitting of a new committee formed by government members and have the opposition to drafting a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the field for election.
Moualem presented conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, stating that the Committee's activities should be limited to "review of the articles of the present constitution" and issued a notice of interference.
Why will Trump win the second mission?
If we were to follow this logic, Trump would be real in 2020, except in case the reviction procedure or the scandals would end its presidential mandate earlier, which a large part of the free hearing is expected to take place.
In this case it would be, without a doubt, "the most dramatic end of a presidential mandate of all ages!"
Until now, it seems that the hearing is still interested in subject.
Since 2014, first-time hearings have doubled to CNN, reaching 1.05 million and nearly tripled to MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News television post has been followed, on average, by 2.4 million people, four years ago when it was followed by 1.7 million, and the release "The Rachel Maddow Show" from MSNBC recorded an audience record, with 3.5 million people who followed it in the series where important news was broadcast.
"This is a subject that attracts the public, because we cannot understand it," said Neal Baer, the producer of the ABC's drama series "President of Reserve" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the capital building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and authorizing the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote with Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, "Because it makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
In haos, fun is appreciated.
Of course, except for anything that is broadcast on TV, the action carried out in Washington could determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case if immigrant families can be complete and about the state of the global economy.
Change of position is a luxury that only the privileged public can afford.
However, you are not only a citizen informed when you arrive at the sixth hour of the debate by a panel of experts using "deep background" (confidentially) sources for his book, "Fiar", about Paul Manafort's hair jacket worth 15,000" (a "opposing vesting object", according to The Washington Post) and the implications of the recent descriptions of the Stormy Daniels actress's "anatomical parts" of Trump.
For example, I will never again look at Super Mario in the same way.
"A large part of what makes you feel like you're looking at a reality show and feeding you with subjects every night," said Brent Montgomery, the executive director of the medium Wheelhouse Entertainment and the issuer of the "Amateur Ass", about the constantly changing distribution and the daily situation returns caused by Trump (declaring a certain US football league, the praise brought to Kim Jong-Un's address).
Don't let you lose an episode, 'cause you'll feel like you're back.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week in his home on the north coast of the island of Kauai, there were 27 degrees and it was sun, and he sat inside looking at the MSNBC and recording from CNN.
He could not get out of front of the television, especially when Brett Kavanaugh was following up with the Senate's legal committee and had to decide on the future Supreme Court.
"I remember we're doing some kind of general emissions in the past, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it seemed like I was right."

Complementary external financial resources for the fastest inter-elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realisation of electoral districts, which resulted in two holders of the mandate in an electoral course for the same function, it is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania enjoys combined financial resources.
Thus, the new suburban of the Pittsburgh district has brought him in the course of the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won, in another district, the special elections of the past spring.
Lamb applies against another mandate holder, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now represented by the 12th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania, which is significantly superior to the 17th.
The electoral papers were re-configured after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were not constitutional, manipulating districts in favour of the republics.
The 17th electoral district course announced competition in the financing of campaigns between major funding agencies of the parties, the Congress Committee for the Campaign for Democracy (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a lasting victory in special elections, with maximum hearings, which took place in March for the 18th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania.
For over a decade the function was occupied by a republican, and President Donald Trump won this district with a difference of 20 points.
According to political commentators, democracy enjoys an easy advantage.
The United States took into account the penalization of El Salvador because of its understanding with China but then gave up
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a preliminary meeting with the President of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the management team of the Trump Organization.
The officials of the State Department decided to call American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of "the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the spokesman of the Department in a statement early this month.
But they were taken into consideration only against the state of El Salvador, which received US aid of approximately $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial assistance and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the country in Central America and the high rate of unemployment and crime.
Since internal meetings have recorded progress, North American and Central American officials have held a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in the prevention of the treatment of migrants to the United States.
But until mid-September, officials from the administration's front made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively completing any review of the sanctions for El Salvador.
It is now planned that Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, in order to highlight the importance of the administration of a meeting agreement, the diplomats have declared.
And the three U.S. ambassadors returned in silence in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or hard sentences from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if their anonymity is maintained.
Their relations have been co-operated by an external analyst, who is close to the administration and has also spoken on the condition that the anonymity is preserved.
History Study
The next thing that could happen is the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible prohibition of justice by President Trump, about which there are now strong public evidence.
It also appears that Mueller is focusing his investigation and on investigating the existence of an interface between Trump and Russia's campaign with regard to the attack on the US elections.
In the event that Congress will change, Trump will face the agreed response within the body, even when he is prepared to appear before the voters and may, if possible, a jury of his colleagues.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that a "frame" of Trump is inevitable, valid and for its counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that we all have to make on one side and on the other of the Atlantic and which will determine the duration of the investigation.
In 1938 the German officers were prepared to give a coup against Hitler, only if the West were against him and he would have supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
I failed and lost this opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexhaustible march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans face some of those critical moments right now.
What do we do if Trump is going to send him to the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein is in a difficult position since it was reported in this paper that last year it suggested the Secretary's secret registration and speculated about its incompatibility with the President's role.
Rosenstein said the report of the Times was incorrect.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in relation to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court in the face of credible allegations of sexual assault and false witnesses?
And above all, will we vote in the inter-elections for a Congress that will bring it back to Trump's answer?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long iron.
But I don't think we're gonna make it, after the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-born Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied me with the ambassadorial residence.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, he sent me to open Sunday candles on the whiskey table.
With such dignity, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Player Graham Dorrans from the Rangers team is optimistic about the game with Rapid Vienna
Joi, Rangers will be a host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory in the Austrian game, after Spain's impressive match against the Villareal team from the beginning of the month, will put it in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European Union.
An accident on the knees didn't allow middleman Graham Dorrans to play in this season until 2-2 equals Villarreal, but he thinks that the Rangers team can use this result in its advantage to achieve better performance.
"It was a good point for us, since Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We started the game thinking we'd get a good result and we won a point.
I've probably been able to write at the end, but, in total, I think the equation was a correct result.
I think they've been better in the first place, and we've noticed better in the second.
Joi, it'll be a big evening for Europe again.
At least we'll get three points, but it'll be a hard game, because they've had a good result in the last game played. However, with support from the players, we'll certainly feel and more motivated and have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a challenge, taking into account my accidents and changes from the club, but the situation is better at this time.
The team is good and the boys really like to be here; the training goes also well.
Let's hope that we will endure, that we will leave the events in the last season and that we will have good results."
Women have dreams of pensioning economies
Despite the clear knowledge of how they would be cared for, few people spoke to family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the study conducted by the Nationwide company said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of them said they were able to talk to their children about this subject.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't start this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Company.
Here's how you can start.
Discuss with your spouse and children: You cannot prepare a family to provide you with the care you need if you do not know your needs from time to time.
Work with the consultant and with the family to discuss where and how you will get the care, since these choices could represent a significant factor for setting costs.
Take part in the financial adviser: and the financial adviser may be of real help with respect to the payment of these costs.
Your long-term financial choices may include a long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy, to help you cover these costs or to ensure your own well-being – to the extent that you have money.
Please refer to the legal documents: come to the discussion of legal issues.
Get an authority on medical decisions, to appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical care and to ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes if you cannot communicate them.
Consider also the exercise of power over your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions in your name and to make sure that you have the facts, if you do not have the necessary capacity to do so.
Do not look at the details: Imagine that a parent of yours with an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about her medications and her allergies?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"And it's not all on the financial side. Can you tell me who the doctors are dealing with it?" Martin asked.
"What are the medicines?
Who'll take care of his dogs?
Edit a plan for all these things."
A man was shot more than once with an air-compressed gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot more than once with a compressed-air gun as he walked home after a night in town.
The victim, 40 years old, is in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police officers described the incident, which took place at 02:30 hours, as being “an accident shooting”.
The victim couldn't see his attacker.

Cuttlefish and tuna in Indonesia
At least 384 people died because of a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu, Indonesia, according to the authorities, and is expected to increase the number of deaths.
As a result of the interruption of communications networks, the disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Doghera Regengene, a zone in the north of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was produced.
Here are some key information about Palu and Doghera, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of the centre of the island of Sulawesi, located at the end of a frozen golf course on the coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The town celebrated 40 years of existence when it was hit by tsunamis and earthquakes.
Dothra is a regenital that covers a coast with a surface of more than 300 km in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regenzia, an administrative region located in the south of a province, has a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture activities represent the central point of the economy of the province of the island of Sulawesi, in particular in the coastal region of Doghea.
Mining activities for the extraction of snow are also important in the provinces, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite of the island of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dodha were hit by tsunamis more than once in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused the death of over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donghaa.
Also, in 1996, a tsunami hit the garment part of the Doghea regeneral, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Circle of Fire, an area of intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of the island of Sumatra, declared a tsunami that hit 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean, more than half being in Aceh.
2005: a series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of the island of Sumatra at the end of March and at the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: a 6.8 degree earthquake struck the south of the most popular Indonesian island, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: a 7.6 degree earthquake near Richter's scale took place near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: a 7.5 degree earthquake struck one of the Isles of Mentawai, along the coast of Sumatra, declaring a tsunami with a height of up to 10 metres, which destroyed ten hours and killed about 300 people.
2016: an earthquake with a low intensity occurred in the Pydie Jaya Regengent in Aceh, causing pay and panic, as people remembered the earthquake and devastating tsunami in 2004, which had taken place with a large number of casualties.
So this time a tsunami wasn't declared, but more than 100 people died because of the damaged buildings.
2018: More powerful earthquakes took place on the island of Lombok, causing the death of over 500 people, most of the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily blocked under walls.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the Vice-President, Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, aged 29, from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence claim and in opposition to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the police in the state of Alaska.
According to the police report, when a knowledge of this sex woman tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, she took her phone.
Palin is in police custody at Mat-Su unit, waiting for the process, and is held on the basis of an unencumbered gay, worth 500 dollars, according to KTUU.
This was presented on Saturday in court, where it stated "100% innocent" when it applied for a petition, according to the network.
Palin is faced with three allegations of Class A offences, which means he could be imprisoned for a period of up to one year and amended by $250,000.
They were also accused of a Class B offence, which is punishable by one day in prison and an amendment of $2,000.
This isn't the first time Palin was brought to charges like this.
In December 2017, it was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce alleged aggression.
The case is pending trial at the Veterans Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 it was accused of domestic violence, involving a claim for domestic violence and possession of a weapon while it was in the position of Hebrews in connection with an incident.
According to his love statement, it gave him a bow in front of him.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was associated with post-traumatic stress syndrome that she suffered after she became part of the Iraqi military forces.

The earthquake occurred throughout the central province of Sulawesi, which is in the northeastern part of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On socializing networks circle video clips that present the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people are at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the ground.
The federal prosecutor wants the capital punishment for the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City
New York's federal prosecutor wants the capital punishment for Sayfulllo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City following which eight people were killed, a rare one that has not been applied in the state for a federal offence since 1953.
It seems that Saipov, at the age of 30, used a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike track on the West Side road in the lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on his track in October.
In order to justify capital punishment, prosecutors must prove that Saipov has killed the eight victims "intendedly" and caused "intendedly" serious bodily injuries, in accordance with the intentional opinion on the capital punishment application lodged in the South District of New York.
Both prosecution heads may receive a capital sentence according to the court's document.
In a few weeks after the attack, a major federal juror accused Saipov of 22 counts including eight criminal charges in support of organised crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried out the right to "absolute, cruel and unjust".
“Sayfulllo Habibullavic Saipov caused injuries, suffering and loss for families and friends of the following persons: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci”, according to the intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a case of capital imprisonment in the South York District.
The mayor, Khalid Barnes, was accused of killing two drug dealers, but finally he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a federal case in New York occurred in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two of whom were executed after being charged with conspiracy to the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Rosenberg's wives were executed on the electric seat on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regret in the days and months of the attack.
He testified to the investigators that he seemed good at what he did, according to what the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he felt compelled to execute the attack after watching ISIS video clips on his phone, according to the opposition.
Also, according to the police, he asked to wood the ISIS stage in the hospital room.
He complained innocently about the 22 chiefs of the charge.
David Patton, one of the defenders of the office that represented Saipov, said that they are "evidently disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the capital punishment, instead of accepting a life imprisonment offender, without any possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all the persons involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defence team previously asked the prosecutor not to apply the capital punishment.
A member of the Parliament who is part of the Conservative Party claims that NIGEL FARGE must be in front of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today that he would "mobilize the civil army", during a protest at the Conservative Party's conference.
The former leader of Ukraine said that politicians should "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics, following a statement by a member of the Theresei May Parliament who suggested that this should be in front of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Party, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be "out" until now if Farage was Secretary in the Brexit campaign.
However, the challenge faced by May in relation to the extreme dividends was stressed by members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest against the exit of the European Union organised in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to address such challenges as its compromise plan, namely the Czechs plan, to deal with attacks by those who support the European Union leaving, who want to remain in it as well as by the European Union.
The Allies stressed that it will continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, regardless of consequences, and will strengthen the Euroscept and the Labour Party to choose between its offer and "haos".
Good said in the event of the Pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "reject to the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If things had been done by him, we were no longer in the European Union," she said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, the representative of Wellingborough, added: "You will support Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers plan."
Referring to its opposition to the European Union, it said: "We have not fought in the world war to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Good rejected the suggestions on changing public opinion to the 2016 vote: "It's not quite true that the British have rethinked and that they will remain in the Union."
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told the reporters: "I just want to say so: Prime Minister, listen to people's voices.
"The public is not in agreement with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party is not in agreement with him and our activists who come out on the street and who support us in the first place in the elections.
Leave it to the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message referring to Theresa May, she added: "The ministers who maintain their role are those who respect their promises."
During the meeting, Nigel Farage stated that politicians should be in a position to "feel the pressure" if they are willing to give up the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"He's trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them that "we won't let him do this."
In a letter of appreciation, he added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
"We mobilize the civil army of the country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who support the stay in the European Union traveled through Birmingham before a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners written by "Conservative Party is against Brexitulu" after the group was launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the members of the Conservative Party and the security problems encountered in the application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that I can implement IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the digitization of customs procedures, for free and unlimited trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a farce.
Brexit doesn't bring any benefits," he added.
Warren's planning to think seriously to apply to the president.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said he would think seriously to apply to the presidency after the November elections.
According to the Boston Globe newspaper, Massachusetts's democratic senator spoke on Saturday about her future during a first meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is calling for the November elections against Geoffrey Diehl, a member of the House of Representatives of the Republican Party, who was co-chaired by the 2016 Donald Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was at the center of the speculation that could defeat Trump in 2020.
The event after Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the meeting with 36 voting citizens using the primary format since Trump took over the presidential role.
A participant asked her if she was going to apply for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come for "the women to reach Washington to solve our serious problems affecting our government and that includes finding a woman in his face".
A suspect was arrested in case of death that caused the death of player Sims from the LSU team
The Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested in case of death that caused the death of the LSU basketball player Wade Sims yesterday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced Dyteon Simpson's arrest at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They published a video material at the time of the shooting of winter, asking for help to identify the man in the picture.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near the campus at Southern University, Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday for 247sports.
Wade tried to call his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and recognized that he was in front of the place, that he was in possession of a gun, but also that he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken to police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a young player with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 matches, being 10 times in the initial score in the last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 recoverys on games.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time Valtteri Bottas was qualified before Lewis Hamilton Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team will play an essential role in the course.
Standing in the first position in the classroom, Bottas had a good start and almost won Hamilton, defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his coach.
Vettel was the first one who stopped at the box and left Hamilton at the group's code, which should be decisive.
Mercedes stopped at the box later and came back from Vettel, but Hamilton managed to move forward after some schemes that forced the chief Ferrari to leave the inside free, after he made a double move to defend himself against the third man.
Max Verstappen started running around the back of the truck and is located close to the end of the first tour, even on the day he was 21 years old.
Then he found himself in front for a large part of the course, looking forward to a quick final and trying to pass over Kimi Raikkonen and take place.
Finally, he stopped at the box on the tour with number 44, but couldn't make progress in the last eight races, Raikkonen staying on four.
"It was a difficult day. Valtteri did an extraordinary job all week and behaved like a real gentleman, letting me go ahead.
And the team did a great job to get victory over the Ferraris and to do this double," Hamilton said.
A huge body language
President Donald Trump ironized Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday, during a meeting on her insistants as she did not facilitate the "suckling" of Christine Blasey Ford's letters, which accused Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court of sexual aggression.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are "bad, immoral and liars".
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last days in the Senate, when you see hands, when you see people who are angry and bad and immoral and lying," he said.
"When you see that they published and spent information and then I say they didn't.
They're not responsible.
Do You Remember?
When did I ask Dianne Feinstein if she's been able to "suck" the document?
Do you remember her answer?
Aaaa... no.
I didn't do this."
Well, wait a minute.
No, I didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Fenstein was sent to him by letter detailing his charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "courned" in September, but Feinstein denied that "sucking" was done from her office.
"I didn't hide the charges against Ford and I'm not the one who has facilitated the "distortion" of her report," said Feinstein to the Commission, according to the Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep my privacy and that's exactly what I did."
But her refusal does not seem to be well - received by the president, who commented during the Saturday meeting: “To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that democracy use accusations to reach its own ends.
"I am determined to take power in any way possible.
Notice the evil, immorality, it does not care who is hurt and who must destroy in order to gain power and control," said the President, according to the Mediaite website.

An air traffic controller died after ensuring the decoupling of a plane with hundreds of passengers during a crash
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered to be hero, dying after ensuring the safe landing of an aircraft with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are disappeared after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi, declaring a tsunami.
There were more powerful replications in the area and many people were blocked under the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, Antonius Gunawan Agung, aged 21, refused to leave his post at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, which was being held strong.
This remained in place to ensure that the 6321 Batik Air flight, which is on the track at the time, will be safe.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed that it was about to collapse.
He died in the hospital later.
The spokesman for the air navigation service provider in Indonesia stated that it is possible to decide to save hundreds of lives according to ABC News Australia.
I've prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpan to Kalimantan to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, it died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We are patient with this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths could reach thousands of people, the national disaster management agency stating that access is limited in the cities of Doghara, Siggi and Butung.
"We believe the number will increase, as many victims are still under damage and we have not had access to many of them," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The values of an altitude of up to three feet [6 m] destroyed the city of Palu on Sunday followed by a common funeral.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusumuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings victims.
It's almost impossible to find reliable water.
All the minimarks are broken."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to the CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to offer help to survivors, but we don’t know what to find in front of the place.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and said to the national army: "Please work day and night to complete all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?" announced CNN.
Indonesia was defeated at the beginning of this year's bombing in Lombok, which has been fought with more than 550 deaths.
A plane accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a person is gone after a plane landed in a lake
The Air Company holding the aircraft which landed in a lake of the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now declared that a person is missing, after it stated earlier that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that collapsed.
Air Niugini declared in a press release that a sex passenger is missing after Saturday afternoon.
It further mentioned that she was trying to find the man, along with the local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to additional passenger details requests such as age or nationality.
Local ships were used to retrieve other passengers and crew after the aircraft struck water while trying to land on the island of Chuuk.
Friday, the authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The air company said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The U.S. Air Company and the United States Naval Forces have declared that the aircraft has missed the landing track and reached a lake near it.
Some witnesses believe the plane has crossed the end of the track.
American national passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very small distance from the sun.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which reached the bridge, and reach the emergency exits of the plane that collapsed.
He also said that the crew were panicking and panicking and that he suffered a minor wound on his head.
The United States Naval Forces said that mariners working near to refurbishing a ship were helping, using a golf course to transport people safely before the plane sank 30 metres below water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people died in the accident of some airlines registered in PNG in the last two decades, but none of them included an aircraft from Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the time of the night in which a woman was burned alive
Saturday, the prosecutor closed her complaint regarding the reopening of the trial for a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, has submitted testimony for more than an hour as an expert witness in information analysis.
He presented to the jury the way he used his cell phone records to lead Quinton Tellis' actions, at the age of 29, as well as his victims, Jessica Chambers, at the age of 19, on the night that he died.
Rowlett said he received localization data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he was killed, this being in contradiction with his previous claims, according to the paper Clarion Ledger.
At the time the data were taken out of his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called in the witness box and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck the other night, Sanford said he "had lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
Mobile phone records indicate they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that, shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis spread the text messages, calls and contact data of Chambers on his phone.
"He threw it out of his life," said Hale.
According to the clock, the defense will begin on Sunday's final anniversary.
The judge stated that he predicted that the jury would decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: what is the hip-hop known?
A trio who sings hip-hop music wants to change the negative mode in which this kind of music is seen, using positive tunes.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip-hop has stopped sending political messages and addressing social problems, as it did at the beginning.
They want to return to their origins and make the hip-hop known to be popular again.
A recent renaissance of artists such as The Refugees and Common in the United Kingdom has been observed through such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
Another color person?!
A New Yorker judge a couple because they let her after she received a "rasist" text message
A New York judge gives a couple a reason for granting discrimination after she has received, in error, a text message from her mother, in which she complained that she was "another person of color".
The husband rejected the fact that they were racist, claiming that she had given her judgment for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed surprise when she found out that her new grandmother, Giselle Maurice, was of color when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"NOUUUUUUUU! NOT A CULOARE PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent him to Maurice twice.
After taking note of the gauze, feeling angry, Plasco-Flaxman granted Maurice a grant, claiming that her grandfather, who is an African-American, did not properly fulfill her duties and that she was expected to receive a pledge of Filipino nationality, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for the day of work and sent home with Uber.
Now, she judges her husband to agree to grant her leave and seeks the amount of 350 dollars a day for six months, the period in which she had to stay with her and carry out her activities, although this is done without a contract concluded.
"I want to show them not to do this," she said to the Post newspaper tomorrow, adding, "I know it's a word of discrimination."
The husband rejects the statements about being racist, saying it was a normal thing to grant Maurice her because they were afraid they could no longer trust her after they hung her.
"My wife sent him an error message.
He's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco, their husband, for the Post newspaper.
"But did you leave your children in the hands of a person whom you had wronged, even if it was a mistake?
The newborn child?
Let's be serious."
In view of the "extortion" process, Plasco stated that his wife would be born in two months and that she is in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you really want to punish someone in such circumstances?
There's nothing like that," added the bank investor.
While the process is in progress, the public opinion has accused the couple of socializing networks, judging them for the behaviour and logic they have demonstrated.
Paddington's story editors feared that readers would not be able to identify with a bear that speaks according to a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the letter was accepted, said: “It’s hard to put yourself in the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's very funny now, after I saw that Paddington had a terrible success."
It further stated that his father, who was a cameraman for BBC before he was inspired by a playbook to write the book for children, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his work, adding that the anniversary of the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was a "dark-amber" after he died last year.
About Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father had a discreet pride about the success she had enjoyed later.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he didn't like to praise himself," she said.
"We, because Paddington was so real to him, it was as if he had a child who had a success: you are proud of him, although it is not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, it was always used to accord Paddington's honor."
My daughter was dead and I had to get off my phone.
At the landing, her daughter was transferred quickly to Nisa's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where the doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad often calls to tell me that it's very serious and that he doesn't think he'll survive," Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad telling me she's gonna die in the next two minutes and I have to get some rest from her
And that's exactly what I did.
I told him: “Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medicines administered to keep her heart pumping blood began to decrease and get out of her body.
In time, walls were destroyed and organs began to no longer function.
I needed to stay there and wait, aware of everything that was going on.
I couldn't laugh or shut up because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, being down after his daughter's death, was on board, along with other passengers, who didn't know what happened.
"No one knew," she said.
"I kept my head down and the tears didn't stop running.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had a complex feeling of compassion towards Nad.
I realized he needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two pregnant women spread various messages on a post to prevent suicide
Two women who lost loved ones because they killed themselves tried to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys spread several messages on a post from the Galilor country, many of which are motivated and including telephone numbers where people can call to get support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and died at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, at 45 years of age, lives in Lydney and says his son is after being a promising cook with a mollusc cell.
"Everyone appreciates the smile.
They've always said his teeth change your mood."
However, he gave up his job before he died, since he had arrived at a very unhappy time in his life.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after he took his life.
David said: "I think everything will have a dominant effect on you."
It created messages “to communicate to people that I can call someone or that I can talk to someone, even a friend.
Externize yourself, you need to talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' oldest friend, lost Mark, his 15-year-old life partner, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he wasn't feeling well or he's depressed," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, I noticed that her attitude changed.
He was in a state of despair on Christmas, when the children did their gifts and he didn't even look at them."
She said that his death had been a tremendous blow for them, but she had to overcome it: “It caused great pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we must go further and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in play, as a result of the initiation of the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
"I thought that if I could get something similar to what he asked – a limited period of time and limited expansion – I could have a small unit," said Jeff Flake Saturday, adding that the Commission is about to "disintegrate", at the bottom of a party block.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his supporters want a FBI investigation?
Their reticence is due to the entire time factor.
There are only five weeks until the 6th November elections - if, as it is expected, the Republicans have produced bad results, their attempts to place the one who wants to win the elections for the highest court in the country will be significantly weaker.
George W. Bush has all called the senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI finalizes the report?
There will be a vote in Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently present.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to make the difference in case of equality and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea falls under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong came into power seven years ago, a South Korean MP said.
Park Byeong-seug, reading data from the South Korean Union Ministry of Unity, said last year they fled about 1.127 people in the country, compared with 2.706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were the stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates perceived by those who carry people illegally across the border.
The Phoenician did not make any public comment.
A large majority of North-West refugees are finally offered to South Korean citizens.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
The most often fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the powerful protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers illegal migrants to be more vulnerable than refugees and often repatriates them strongly.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still, in practice, in the war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenian for some of the discussions that had been entitled to the negotiations on denuclearization.
This took place after the historic meeting between US Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong from Singapore when they agreed, in general, to collaborate for a Korean pendulum without nuclear weapons.
But Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States sanctions of lack of progress since then.
"If we can't trust the United States, we won't be able to trust our national security and, in such a situation, we won't be the first ones to be unilaterally disarmed," Ri said in a speech addressed to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as being "staric", saying it's impossible to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court for "steric" and said his temper was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made Saturday's comments during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think that if there was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared "sterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's judicial committee, which took place today.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that she would have raped Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost stopped and lost his voice because of the emotions, while he discussed his family and school years.
He also explicitly condemned democracies within the Commission, calling charges against him "a gross and coordinated killing of the character", organised by angry Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said it is in the opinion that Kavanaugh's testimony has shown that he cannot serve the Supreme Court, because it has shown that he has a partner character against the democracies.
"I think he is disqualifying with the statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and democracy," she said.
Pelosi owes it to the subject when he was asked whether he will try to stop Kavanaugh whether it will be confirmed and whether democracy will win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I just want to say this: if you don't tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate, not only for the Supreme Court, but not for the court in which it is now," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the Court of Appeal of the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, he is concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh against the laws available to care or the Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question whether he would postpone certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the right time for a woman, a partner, to go to court and wait for us to say "wow! what a wonderful one!" Pelosi said.
And women have to put their hands on her.
It's a justified diet, it's months and years of accumulated anger and it can't talk without crying.
"We cry when we are upset," said Gloria Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, does it?"
She continued: “I received a significant help from a woman who took an executive position, who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique according to which, when she was upset and began to cry, she told the person she was speaking to: “You may think I am sad because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then it goes on.
It seemed like a great thing to me."
The tears are allowed to exonerate anger, partly because they are fundamentally wrong.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a man-dominated office, where I began to cry because of an unexpressed rage, is that I was stabbed by a woman older than I was, a direct cold towards which I have always felt a bit of fear, and she took me to the stairs house.
"I must never see you crying," she said.
"I don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be glad that they caused you this feeling."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Congress in Colorado State, worked with Gary Hart at the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Hart was arrested for having an extraconjugal relationship on a ship called Monkey Business and retired from the course, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, was thought that he had no reason not to apply for herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a very well-thinked decision," she says, laughing 30 years later.
"There are already seven other candidates in the course, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone referred to the situation as "White as the White and the Seven Dogs".
Because the campaign was at the end, she was behind the fund-raising and she swore she wouldn't get in the race if she couldn't get 2 million dollars.
It was a lost war.
He found out that some of her supporters who gave them $1,000 to men, they only gave him $250.
"Do they think I'm getting cuts?" she asked.
During the speech in which he announced that he would not launch a company officially, he was so affected by emotions – as a result of recognition for the people who supported him, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult for him to throw money and see the voters in the place of the delegates, but also the anger caused by gender discrimination – he lost his voice because of the emotions.
"You said I had a nervous crisis," remembers Schroeder about the reactions of the press to her.
"You said one of my sponsors was Kleenex."
I remember thinking about what they're writing on my funeral stone.
"A plan?"
How can the trade war between the United States and China benefit Beijing?
The greetings that announced the beginning of the trade war between the United States and China have been convincing and, although it seems to be longer until its completion, the arguments between the two countries may be useful for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning at the beginning of this year, by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important scaling took place this week with new taxes, which have affected products worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds of sterline), applying, in fact, half of all goods from China that reach the United States.
Beijing has been reimbursed every time, the most recent tax tax of between 5 and 10% for US products worth $60 billion.
China has warned that it will respond to every hit by the United States and is less likely that the world's second largest economy will take a step back in the near future.
In order for Washington to withdraw, China must be in line with its requests, but publicly surrendering before the United States would be too humiliating for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that, if Beijing plays its books well, US pressures on trade war could support China positively in a long term, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to economic deterioration in both countries would in fact be more dangerous than what has been predicted so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia at the Centre for New American Security, a group of experts.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, Minister for Foreign Affairs says
Syria claims it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding the country devastated by a war that lasts longer than seven years.
During his speech in the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam said that the situation in the country improved.
"Today, conditions on the ground are more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made towards combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the devastated areas of terrorists so that things will come back to normal.
The existing conditions allow the voluntary return of refugees in the country where they were required to leave it because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at everyday life and their lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011, when the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem stated that the Syrian regime would be pleased to receive assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, it stressed that conditional assistance and assistance from countries sponsored by the insurgent will not be accepted.
European team winning Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 after winning the American team with a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National from the Paris, France.
The United States has now registered the sixth consecutive victory in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned to the first place after the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn team got 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mikkelson, who has made incredible efforts in most of the tournament, has sent the first shot in water on May 3rd, 16th, leaving Francesco Molinari's game.
The Italian golfer Molinari had an incredible performance in all the races, becoming one of the four players with a 5-0-0 result since there was the current tournament format, from 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5 and 4 in front of the player at the latest in the European team, Thorbjörn Olesen from Denmark.
The player from the first place in the world class, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 in front of Ian Poulter in England, this is probably his last game from Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, who participated in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the player of Europe with most winners, recording an average of 25.5 points throughout his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he chose me and that he believed in me.
I'm extremely happy I was able to win the cup again.
It's a team job and I'm glad I was able to help," said Garcia, excited after European victory.
This gives him the title of his consonant, John Ram, who won Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at the 2nd and 1st games on Sunday.
"I'm very proud that I beat Tiger Woods. I used to follow the matches when I was a child," said Rahm, at the age of 23.
Woods lost all the four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 on Ryder Cup.
A weird statistics for one of the best players of all ages, who won 14 important titles, being just Jack Nicklaus.
All weekend, the American team threw a real effort on the golf course, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played outstandingly throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after his team's humiliating performance: "I'm proud of them, they've even tried.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've been fighting cancer.
Take the ball for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
I'll work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go further.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to agree to respect the word.
They played better than we."
News about the Red Sea: the concentrations dropped in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report of the Florida Fauna Protection Commission shows a general decline in the large red concentration for certain areas of the Tampa Gulf.
According to the Commission, non-formal conditions of inflorescence are reported in the areas of the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier committees – which suggest lower concentrations.
This large red inflorescence extends on a surface of about 210 km, from the north of the Pinelas Committee to the south of the Lee Committee.
Bethel may be located about 16 km across the Hillsborough Committee, but in less places than last week.
The red sea has also been observed in the Pasco Committee.
The mean concentrations in or around the Pinellas Committee were reported last week, as well as the low to high in the Hillsborough Committee, the low to high in the Manatee Committee, the low to high in the Sarasota Committee or its scope, the low to medium in the Charlotte Committee, the low to high in the Lee Committee and its long and low in the Collier Committee.
The irritations of the breathing pathways in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier committees continue to be reported.
No cases of respiratory irritation have been reported in the northwestern United States of Florida last week.
