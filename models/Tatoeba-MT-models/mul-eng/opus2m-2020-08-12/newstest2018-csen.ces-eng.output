Citizen law enforcement issued a travel alert for Missouri
The National Colour Assessment Association (NAACP) published warnings for people travelling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory State principles and racist attacks.
“The NAACP travel recommendation for the state of Missouri, with effect from 28 August 2017, calls on African American travellers, visitors and people of Missouri to pay increased attention to the state as a result of a series of controversial racially motivated incidents currently occurring throughout the state,” says the association’s statement.
NAACP indicated that this step has been taken on the basis of the current laws of the State of Missouri, which facilitate the pursuit of racistly motivated acts before the Court, as well as by the conduct of the criminal authorities which are not targeted at minorities.
‘It is a violation of civil rights.
People are arrested by police only because of their skin color, they are attacked or killed," he said to Kansas City Star President NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel.
"We still have the greatest amount of difficulties."
It's about the first protection of its kind, which the U.S. organization has issued.
Among the incidents that the organization quoted were racially motivated contributions directed against students of black platitude at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a man of black platoons from Tennessee.
Sanders died in the disputed circumstances at the beginning of this year after he got gas on his way to the state when he was travelling, and the police dragged him into a relationship without charge of breaking the crime.
The travel recommendation also warns of a recent declaration of the highest state representation of the state of Missouri, which states that the blackout drivers have 75% higher chance of stopping the police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to warn people and protect their families, friends and colleagues from what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be prepared - they should take money with them on a case-by-case loan or warn their relatives that they are going to travel to the state."
According to the current figures of the FBI programme for reporting hate acts, in 2015 in Missouri there were hundreds of hate cases, reaching the state in the sixteenth place of all States.
The travel threat is also a response to the new Missouri Act, which facilitates complaints of discrimination against companies when providing housing or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona following the adoption of an immigration law allowing state actors to retain people on the basis of a violation of this law which, according to ACLU, is to improve racial profile.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for foreign countries, but have recently turned to this measure in response to specific laws and trends in the United States.
The model was killed by the chief of police.
Her family doesn't have any rest after 12 years!
The Sally Anne Bowman model is murdered.
A girl from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by Chief of Staff Mark Dix at the restaurant where she was working.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana and then kill her.
He then sat down in a nearby coffee shop and followed a vicious criminal work looking for a place to do.
Dixie, former chief of police, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years' imprisonment for murder and rape of Sally's model.
The judge only admitted the young man's attack and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a girl dead lying on the street.
Three years later, the police gave him a witness.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-friend Lewis Sportson were arguing on the night of the trial.
The Queen said: "He was very angry, and a girl cried after his attack."
"Doncce drew attention to the taxi driver," he said.
According to his statement, the girl was supposed to defend herself, but she could, rather, be crazy.
Lewis was supposed to hit her on the street.
Dixie's version was proved as a lie and blamed him.
After Dixie's confession, he talked about his endurance and kissed the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt comfortable and had to burn marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was with his ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, he told Dexie himself.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started crying for help, so he attacked her back and put his hand over her mouth," added the Mirror Linda.
And after twelve years, the family faces other attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
In the last half year, he was injured four times.
There are so many people in freedom who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the Mirrrr's mother told Linda's mature girls about the loss of urine with the pop.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to get stuck when she left the cemetery.
The design vibrators are worth tens of thousands.
"They're not clever or conservative," says Martin Raž, who runs the Prague Intimity Butterfly.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic aids.
Including those from the Czech designer Anna Mares.
It's started in an accident, it's broken 12 years ago.
Martin Raž and his friend went out on a bike after Moravia.
Not only did one of them drive, but also the bugs were full of watching vibrators.
"The various jeans and dolphins and all of them were green and yellow and simply different," she tells me about lunch.
His friend also decided to work with a German designer of the design erotic help Fun Factory, which Martina was interested in, so he offered to help out with marketing.
When his partner went out to hire another profession, he rewarded him.
Today it runs in the Prague Benedict Street buttik Intimity, where it sells erotic aid in a way that is usually offered by luxury cables or boots.
And why not?
It's also about design items.
Wait, wait, that's what you're having for dinner, you're saying?
But come on, don't be such a puritan!
The Berlin Fun Factory, which proposed a well-known designer Karim Rashid, served for the business of Intimity as an inspiration.
He was opened in 2010 and was completely different from the concept of erotic commerce that all are used to.
No hidden exhibitions, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products displayed rather than in perfume.
Martin began to consider with his business partner Zdeček Shebelka how to take the market where he should be and how he should be named.
The name Intimity liked both of them.
"It's related to intimacy recently and it's also, it can be said, gentle," she says.
She followed the purchase of Internet domains and search for suitable space, which went in parallel with various visualizing interiors.
Finally, she won the variant, which spread the trade into the garden of the kitchen and the bedroom, which led her to bed.
She's been preparing her for the Dagmar Stépán from the Forma Fatal study.
We found space in 2013.
First, he didn't seem perfect because he's not on the main street, but he's been sitting on the name of intimacy.
It's intimate.
She's in the street next to the main street, so no customer's watching," says Martin Raž.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to do a trade that would be different, with a brand-new beautiful product, in the middle where women who are mostly our customers feel good.
And not to be ashamed of getting into such a business.
When I got into the Intimacy bottle about half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Besides, I shouldn't even feel like I'm going to trade with erotic help.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion shops.
Even if there is only female service in the store, so that women do not hesitate to ask for help, it doesn't mean that they don't have a man's leg here.
Most of the gentlemen here are going to buy gifts for their friends.
"The majority of men are unable to determine the right size and prefer even greater," Martin laughs at the frequent mistake.
These are such predictions, these living clichés that women need some great help, and that's not true.
So a man in good faith may choose a very large vibrator.
Similarly, a man likes a particularly black bed, where a woman makes her way into a pink color.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product called satisfyer.
From an expression in my face, it must be clear that I don't know what's going on because Martin suddenly explains how it works.
It's such an indefinable clitoris stimulant.
Pere needs an adolescent in me to look forward to the important tone I've been given with.
It'd be like it wouldn't work.
And that doesn't really make sense.
It's for a good price and has a perfect user reference.
We didn't believe he'd be so welcome.
It's about some last revolutionary news.
The first revolution caused a vibrator in the form of a sea horse.
He made sure that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The other one was a We-Vibe couple vibrator.
He completely collected a tab that some men can endure and that he sees competition in erotic aids.
"There are different options," she continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
It's a favorite category.
A woman may have control of her hands and determine the intensity of her vibration.
On the other hand, a certain throw is the category of charging vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to give priority to multicellular assistance and buy classic vibrators, although they only need to use it externally.
In Western Europe, especially in young customers, it is very popular.
What about the man?
It's hard to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It'd have to be a little bit different.
It's a question of what men are to offer," Martin thinks.
"We also have aid for them, but to a limited extent." Most of them are sold primarily by the masturbater, in this case by the manufacturer of Tenga.
It doesn't look like anatomic like vaginal vaginas, but "it's like a spray gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
Much is focused on the function and benefits of use.
It's completely different in Japan.
That's what makes me wonderful.
I was worried that the Japanese would be very patient with erotic help, I mean.
"This is the reality of the Internet," I've been told.
This whole thing is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aid is more related to the use of women.
In Japan, they are quite normal for men, but they are taboo for women." Only for the sake of interest - what the Japanese sign of Tenga, which is represented in the Intimity bottle, is sold worldwide, still creates half of what is sold only in Japan.
In Our Waters
The Czechs and the Czechs are not so smart.
On the contrary, we're a total hostile people.
It's definitely different from the country, such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical customer of business is moving between 35 and 50 years and "has a certain experience with sexual life, however with some benefits.
It'll come for something nicer, better than a partner's life, or for herself."In order to get back, Martin Raž with his business partner Zdenek Šebelk is trying to convince each product that it's perfectly functional.
We also don't want to go to special type of bandage and latex, because we don't have room for it, but it's definitely not happening here.
Such things could affect those we're trying to target.
Which are people who always had to go to a sex shop because they were afraid they'd look something like that.
The composition of the products displayed on the police is really interesting.
This is also indicated by the selection of represented characters.
Some of them even got design prices, including Red Dot Design Award.
At least the first evaluation was mentioned by the sea horse "and it led to a change throughout the industry.
It started to get rid of cheap materials and instead work with healthy unusual ones, other designs, different colors...
It's good to see some of them design Chechnya and popular designer Anna Maresov.
I've got to say that I've been quite surprised how many people are buying those designers Whoop.de.do from Anne Marès, although they're relatively expensive.
They're customers who're going straight to Venice's girl from Anna Maresque.
It has led to a really huge turn of work because, within the Czech Republic and abroad, it has represented exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic aid is allowed to do something different, beautiful, with the story.
Ann's story started as a school job.
Now it's about a finished product that's more made for us.
I wanted to have the production process under control, and I wanted to know what materials and how to produce Whoop.de.do products.
Because it's not about big business, but a small series, it's definitely more expensive than a big series.
Maybe I'm going a little against the floods, but I think it's important to keep up with our development in the Czech Republic.
It could be easy to say that in a few years we will no longer be able to do anything," she later describes the situation of Anna, who agrees with Martin that our company is still more open.
A negative or negative presence is not affected.
They're at least people getting divorced.
"But then you start laughing." Currently Anna Marès has a vibrator on which you can make a personal presentation, and this year she also plans her own lubricant gel.
The next year, she should have a vibrating egg and other news.
Limits on sexual health
I'm wondering where the limit is what's right.
Is there something Martin Raj wouldn't sell anymore?
It's really hard to define.
Which one comes from normal, another may seem quite abnormal, so we're going to measure ourselves by the variety of sign manufacturers.
None of them will be allowed to go to some extremes.
Before we get divorced, I have the last question: What was the crazyest question they've ever had?
Just this week, he came by e-mail, where a woman asked for masturbating help for her friend, who was born 20 inches [28 cm] long.
So we had to write that we had no such regrets.
It's still a question of whether anyone's been kidding us," Martin thinks me suspiciously.
And it's been a while...
Morning for Karla Gotta.
Two letters of Alzheimer's!
His friend Karel Štèdry is fighting a serious weakness.
The best friend Karla Gotta is fighting with violence that steals people's memories.
"Yes, it's a pity of the truth," confirmed the sad information of Bleska himself.
I know about my disability, and I'm still fully able to control it.
"Berugs that have an initial liver failure," he added, thanking the neighbor for his support.
The whole developed family was struggling to simplify Karl's life.
Eva's wife is trying to be home, most of all, she comes to her father's house in the White Mountains and the daughters from the first marriage of Zuzana and Teresa, the son of Karel, named Karlas.
He fought cancer twice and gave Slavikov his experience to support him during his treatment.
He's got sixty chemotherapy for himself.
He was able to go back to work and to the tennis court and to the skirmish.
"I'm supposed to be here by the age of nine," said Karel Bleska.
He's a fighter.
He's still trying to sing.
"I'm still paying attention to the song so I don't forget it," acknowledged Karel.
With the same disability he is fighting now in the building and heretics of Kveta Fial.
Do you have a patient with Alzheimer's?
Look at how you treat him.
The Chilean Parliament has lifted a ban on interruption, the U.S. law.
In Chile there is still an absolute ban on artificial pregnancy, which should not be carried out for health reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators have made trouble with the Constitutional Court and that there will now be ten people to decide on what we have been meeting in Parliament for more than two years," said socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and at the end of August should receive a new president, who is under AFP's immediate opposition.
The law breaking the absolute ban on interruption, initiated by contemporary President Michelle Bachelet, adopted the Senate on 19 July.
The law opposition then announced that the law would attack the court because it says it violates the rights of an unborn child to live.
The votes cast on the proposal for a law last month were postponed until it was examined by the Joint Parliamentary Committee.
In the middle of the proposal, the messengers agreed and did so again by the Senate.
According to the new legislative amendment, there should be an artificial cessation of pregnancy in three cases: if a woman’s life is threatened, if the fruit has no hope of survival, or if pregnancy is caused by rape.
Similar exceptions existed according to the Spanish letter El País in Chile since 1931, so long before the women were granted a vote in 1949.
The absolute ban on interruption in 1989 was imposed by the legal dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the president's office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where it pays an absolute ban on interruption.
Other are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in El Salvador, there are now about 20 women in the network who have been sentenced to up to 30 years in prison for breaking up their pregnancy.
In many cases, it was followed by human rights defenders of the spontaneous use of which the court designated for murder.
Is there anything more sacred?
The map of the White House is now Socha Freedom
A false sign of change in the regime is criticism of soh.
The Americans could report it as well as all the others - see carefully illustrated collection of soybeans Saddám Hussina at the Firdos village in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trump regime, certainly knew what was going on when, during a recent debate with CNN reporter Jim Acostu on presidential proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigrants, he expressed his symbolic safety at the Soch Freedom.
It's worth adding that Miller didn't rely on the soybean.
To that end, he would be bound by the gift of the owner of the ship and the model of the Sochy Freedom.
However, he stressed its importance, in particular the fact that in 1903 the plaque was placed on the ground with the famous basilica Emmy Lazarus, which was 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller quoted Acosta as saying: “I don’t want to go to history here, but Socha Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that is rising light all over the world.
The pool, which was placed on the base additionally, and which you refer to, is not part of it."
Miller's actually right, but the way he introduced himself, this isn't about history.
This is especially about the shocking word Emmy Lazarus, who resolves today - calling them not only immigrants, but the poorest among the poorest: "Let me go, let me guess who is poor, who can breathe freely, who is poor red in the middle of the cities."
And even in modern times, we can be better able to track these "low reds" on our screens.
Miller didn't try to criticize poetry-- he wanted to explain that these people aren't welcome in the United States.
This conflict on the importance of soshia is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict on the significance of America.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends who, after her death, complained about putting up a poster on the ground of a couch, knew quite well that she was going to get into a high political game.
Socha should express the association of the French and American Republic government by representing a classical theme, so that women's body of freedom.
Emma Lazarus has changed this importance: in her garden there is not a woman's attitude abstract, but has her own voice.
It also has a very different name: Mother of Refugees.
Consistency with women is a brilliant feminist stage and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way as Emma Lazarus has changed the importance of soybeans, the right-holders of the right to return this value is long sought.
A well-known commenter, Rush Limbaugh - Jana Baptiste on Trump's move to power - in 2010 argued that Socha Freedom is not actually a country, but represents an early nonconstitutionalism, bringing the American flame to the rest of the world: "Socha Freedoms is going forward.
It issues freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The source won't light up the way to the United States."
Limbaugh's buying a doll's got an important thing in it.
The report of the sochies depends on the role of the view.
Emma Lazarus describes the drought from the look of exhausted and exhausted traveler, who sometimes comes in hopes of entering a new land after a long and terrible flood over the ocean.
It is a scripture about the world’s view of people who are looking for shelter and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, it expresses hope and satisfies their needs.
And of course it's a perspective that Miller and Trump certainly don't know.
Their origin is not to illuminate the path of hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championships in the Athletic 2017: Neil Black sings praise to the Scottish members of the British team
Elidh Doyle recalls the time when he had only two Scottish members
The director of the United Kingdom's athletic Federation Neil Black stated that the strong 16 Scots in the World's Mystery team will be "a major contribution to the team".
For MS in London, starting Friday 2017, a record number of Scottish athletes were selected.
Black believes that "something special is happening" in Scotland and British athletes could learn from Scotland.
"We're trying to understand and adapt - we're going to work on it," Black said.
"I spoke to people from the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The representatives of Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British athlete: He's got something to do with what they did.
They think they're on the streets too.
Whatever it is, it's really amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will be forced on medals, including Lauri Muir and Andrew Butcharta - who will compete with Sir Mo Farahem in the race for 5000 m, while Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the team.
‘It will be modest.
Her initial words were wonderful," Black said.
“Some athletes, whether Scots or other nationalities, left the rooms with a feeling of great pride and motivation.
The dignity and unbridled feelings that Elidh spoke to were irreparable."
A powerful communist medalist, who will compete during the 400 m barrier to his fifth world mission, stated that he is "unbelievably" that there are 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous records from 1983 and 2015 are seven.
On the Medieval Road, Muirova has only established five British and two European records in the last year.
The MS will take part in a run at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who runs the track at 1500 m. He won the British team races and the Year's Games in the annual season.
Doyle recalls his first experience, which was the only other Scottish member of Lee McConnell's team.
The captain told the team that it was "very proud" in the fact that not only many of their colleagues got into the team but in many cases they would also be affected by the finals and medals.
"The extraordinary thing about the position of the captain of the team is that I was elected by the other members of the team. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was chosen by the members of the team is a pleasure," she added.
“I am obviously very proud of all the Scots who have joined the team.
It proves where I moved.
They're athletes who're going to think about the front seats on the floor.
And my initial word?
Yes, I think she did.
I've just warned the fact that we can be proud of this year's mission because it's riding on the domestic floor.
It is important to use the support of domestic fans and to rejoice that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I've got a second chance at the race and I'm going to enjoy an ineffective atmosphere."
Blocking criticism on Facebook: don't worry about public function if you don't answer the voter's criticism
Our father knew about his criticism.
American George Washington loved it, but it didn't take the press long to start criticizing it for anything, starting foreign politics, and end up with his political views.
Yes, this criticism left her cold.
But he didn't try to keep up with criticism.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of expression can be taken away - and stupid and we will be taken as sheep for a defeat."
This leads me to Maryland is the governor of Larry Hogan, who needs to work to start acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and cleared contributions at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, the U.S. Union of Civil Liberties appealed to her for this action.
The government's employees rejected the application as unreasonable, and in comments on the Internet there were many views of the type "who cares about it".
"It's just Facebook," introduced many users.
That's what it matters.
Especially when it's about people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, it is about an indisputable popular republican governor.
It can be the second highest favorite of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not exciting.
As it is seen, its state is guided by its own safety and strictly adheres to its principles.
It has also been shown that it is useful to use Facebook as the main means of connecting with its volunteers - except for the publication of the first photograph with the head hall after the graduation of chemotherapy.
The blockade of people who welcome the government's website - which is a public forum, marked as official and edited by its employees paid from tax taxpayers - is excessive and ultimately dangerous.
In a speech for Washington Post Hogan's day, spokeswoman Amelia Chase defended the governor that blocking comments has taken place from a position of moderation of contributions.
However, using images of Internet trolleys, spammers or scattered people is too easy.
Washington Post told a couple of real people who had reduced contributions.
And that's exactly what they are -- real people talking to their chosen leaders; a teacher, a businessman and a shepherd, no trolleys.
As they all pointed out, their comments were frank and thoughtful, not rude.
In his comment, the pastor read the Bible, calling upon Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer of Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramieni, Md. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hate.
"I have just noticed that I have been disappointed by his inadequate response to hate crimes and other current reports," she wrote in the section with a commentary to the Washington Post newspaper.
"I don't like the idea that whenever a certain number of people comment on the same subject, some people are marked for the promotion of so-called collective efforts instead of being recognized as a large group of interested citizens."
What the government officials called "the central level" would probably also be called "the obbajobo".
Modern Facebook era allows us to easily edit contributions by blocking criticism or reducing negative comments.
It is much more comfortable than in the past when the same procedure would require the sending of employees to the streets where they would collect and burn all the pressures with criticism or arrest or silence the Protestants.
And that's exactly what's going on, just in a digital way.
Hogan is not the last public factor to be criticised for the denial of Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is in charge of a complaint by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The President, Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, according to District Judge James C. Cacherise, broke the first addendum in Alexandria, where she had access to one of the voters on her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also attended visits from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time Washington had a low post office price practically the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily printing was quadrupled and its leadership was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under the pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Vallerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote letters to the press and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by people under the online project Papers of George Washington Project, five of his offices gathered to criticize his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he didn't.
Freedom of expression, agreement and fear lies in the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader must accept it.
They've been using free roaming more quickly than home in foreign countries.
In the Czech border they need more from their tariff than from their home.
Most of them are moving to Rakouska, but the needs of data in the annual season are being introduced by Croatia.
However, they have more time to browse the web than most of them can access Wi-Fi under the sun.
The beach, the purchase and the smart phone in your hand.
In this way, it seems typical Czech allowed in Croatia after customers can use the services of local operators for domestic prices.
This is reflected in company O2's pure statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech passengers abroad have more data available within the passport than at home.
It is not surprising, therefore, that in Croatia, where there is a minimum nesting during the winter, data consumption has risen evenly in the annual season.
Italia then moved to the second place in the grid of data used.
Most of the minutes Czechs come from Germany, where many of them come from work and during the summer.
Croatia, according to the data Association of Czech Travel Offices, visits 800 thousand Czechs annually, is our most popular destination.
However, people here have changed the book about sharing experiences using mobile phones.
The record was on June 7th.
"To the data transmitted, tens of millions of photos would come," explained the details of the director of the mobile segment in O2 Silvia Cieslar.
Despite Croatia's data size, the highest number of Czech users is moving in neighbouring countries.
First place is Rakousko, followed by Germany and Slovenia.
Croatia is the fourth and Italy is the sixth.
To Rakouska we're going to express a faster tourist and active holiday, which we don't have much time to browse on the Internet.
"In addition to the Czech Republic, it is just going to Jadran," Cieslar explained.
As long as the operator noted the release of roaming charges for high mid-term growth, the phone is much lower.
The number of minutes allowed in the room increased around the length of time to double.
With a huge leap in front of other countries, Germany is ruling here.
"Romings use more business customers on work routes," Cieslarov added.
Ronan Rafferty trusts in domestic atmosphere at Renaissance Club
The former golfer Ronan Rafferty will be in the comfort of the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative area of East Lothian, which is hosted by the 25th year of Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year at the recent golf game Archerfield Links on the way to the final. This year will play the role of the tour ambassador in the role of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've been watching the Renaissance Club gradually grow in front of my eyes and the annual tour will show the world its beauty," said Rafferty.
"Players will be able to love the first quality of the game.
Jerry took a great job.
He's a hot fan of this game and he's proud of his success.
The annual tournament is in the right hands."
English Eales will first call the master title, although during his 32-year career he won the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"I have a good feeling of it," said the Southport golfer.
“I had no opportunity to appeal my victory to Extremadura Open, because the tournament was canceled the year after my victory.
Returning to this part of the country is ridiculous.
It's a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year when my wife Sharon and I had a really big win.
It was beautiful times I never forgot."
At home, Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from the country of the year.
This event will be his first part since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play at home," Orr said about Helensburg.
“You want it to happen to you and you feel a lot of pressure.
I'm really glad I played again, and I think I'm doing it.
I am at peace with the result of your efforts."
Three players are also joined by former Masters Ian Woosnam and winning senior tournaments Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty..
Orr and former competitor Ryder Cup Sam Torrence are among six Scottish players on the game; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
It is free of charge. Parking is 5 £ per car with one passenger and 10 £ per car with two and more passengers.
All benefits will be awarded to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian country of gold
When Bardina Degei's cooking dinner, he doesn't use his lunch.
In fact, it's only a rare use of tires.
In her wooden tent, which is located in the main town of Ms. Enorotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, the woman is usually simply walking with a sweet fragrance - in the words of the local "note" - straight into the fire.
He'll take out half an hour and feel comfortable with his hands.
Bardina sits on a blue land - home is not equipped with an apartment - where she does her daily work, such as washing her work in shallow water from a nearby move.
In the room without a shower, the toilet is filled.
As the youngest of four of her husband's wives, she was not assigned any fields to work.
Polygamy is common here.
Work in late nights presents a danger: most men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In the village there are more soldiers sitting.
“In the afternoon after five o’clock, no one will be allowed to walk around the village,” says Bardina.
This is a rare view of every day of life at the height of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was declared to be part of Indonesia in 1969 after the controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were brought to vote in the form of public suffocation before the occupying army.
The current wave of protests against Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the quay government, which ruled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enorotali is so far away and deserted town where you will get nine minutes from the main city of Jayapura to Nabire and then a five-hour train ride.
The mass transport in this place doesn't work.
The city of 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboos plates, with wooden ceilings hanging from the ceilings in the hundreds of seats and cuts of colors.
There were only a very few Indonesians, however, journalists, and virtually no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christians, local residents worshiped God by the name of Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We were not used to wearing these watches," says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-cuffed turban, dark shirt and pink dress.
"In the past, we only wore a list."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and the future child mortality is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, however, it is an Indonesian country of gold.
The largest and most famous gold mine in the world of Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from the American Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai - a scaled province about the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport spent $3.1 billion on gold and silver.
In addition, Papua supports the construction of wood at an estimated cost of $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of suffering and assurance of withdrawal from the mighty Indonesian army for Papua New Guinea.
A survey conducted in 2005 by the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid to local military actors and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
Papuanese calling for self-esteem jeopardise this gold bear and are therefore severely depressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuanians have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass killings in the rural areas of Papua have been equivalent to genocide during the past 70th century, as stated by the Asian Commission for Human Rights.
Just last year, the Indonesian police in the region arrested more than 3300 peaceful Protestants.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report of the British archdiocese, describes the cruelty that came last year, as a supernatural correction, torture - according to other reports, is particularly popular rape and correction of the electric current - and brutal harassment of the peaceful demonstrators.
“It’s difficult to calculate the number of victims because incidents occur every week,” said Andreas Harrisono, an Indonesian researcher on Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation has made it difficult for the Papal resources to adapt to Indonesia's colonialist.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are professing Christianity, but demography changes with the presence of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Jávy, Bornea, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The public canteens sell dried chicken and gado-gado or a mixture of vegetables with rice sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
"Immigrants started selling corn and vegetables at traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans," explains four-year-old Abeth You who was born in Spain and moved to the main city of Jayapura.
"The original people of Papuy - Mama (women) - lost their jobs."
The Indonesian President Joko Vidodo, who is represented by Yoko, under his presidential campaign in 2014, has pledged to address inequality and abuse of rights.
The former Tesseror secured his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Spain.
But in Papua it has changed very little and local people feel hurt.
"Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jopwi with the hope that he would hear our call for justice," You said.
In fact, only two months after Jacob’s opening in October, you were shocked.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children sang a night song at campfire in Enorotali, where two Indonesian soldiers were fired from the train from Friday night.
Two of the surprised kids told them they should turn off the lights.
One of the soldiers had this rash and tonne that was called touch and later returned with four other soldiers, local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in the subterranean state chased a group of children and beat them with their weapons, brought victims and witnesses.
One of the soldiers then set fire to a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Julianus Yeimo, was so badly killed that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the nearby electoral committee, and the next day things were still on display.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered at the football game before the local police station and the military leadership and sought justice.
They came with the official hunting lights and performed the dance of Waita - where it runs in the corner and resembles the song of birds - the populace Mee Pago.
A number of Protestants began to threaten the building with stones.
With pressure the soldiers were ordered through the radio: "If the tax tries to stop at least three times, you have a permit to shoot," reported the TIME in an official document, which was never published in local media.
Jeremiahas Kayam (56), the fourth chief of Enarotali Kego Koto, recognized the threat and urged the people to leave their homes.
But no one had his words on the table.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left arm," said the TIME weekly on the porch of his wooden house.
Kayam still doesn't know who was the shooter, but according to his word, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around here and there was a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the local residents, Alfius Youw, was arrested three times, according to his cousin, who was a witness to the shooting.
"I went to the body to convince myself that it is him," said the TIME weekly with John's mind-whispering voice, which, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I loved him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only "ensure" the station that was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," said a press officer of the Papuan police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistio in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch organization, five protesters were killed and many were injured.
The murder report ran through the quadratic media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jok presented his speech to Jayapura and expressed his understanding for the families of the victims and promised to stay violent in Papua.
"I call for an immediate solution to this problem so that he will never be able to come back," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of National Security Wiranto announced that he would introduce an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve the acts of violence that took place in the past.
Almost immediately, they started calling for an apology.
“The majority of acts of violence have been committed for a long time.
Some of these occurred in the 1990 ’ s and others at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we're going to decide on these violent acts, but it won't be a simple task," he said.
However, in a discussion on 5 June for the TIME week held in Jakarta, Wiranto argued that it was not planning to take any measures in Papua.
Instead, say that "all cases will be represented by the court".
Wiranto, who was charged by the UN with "crimes against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand dead during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, stated that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have been resolved, including the incident in Spain.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Spain welcomed his stand with distrust.
"In the last three years I have been asked four times, but I have never expected anything," said John.
"I'm tired."
As he says, several years later he's still alive in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many of your citizens who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to him, members of the army beat him after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After the funeral my body began looking for an army," he said.
And the gun doesn't stop.
The next day, he shot the Indonesian police at a neighborhood in the vicinity of Deiya.
To the fugitive who died one person and the other 17 were injured, came between the neighbors and the manager of the construction company who refused to provide assistance in the transfer of the man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Doww (24), who died on his way to the hospital while fishing in a nearby river.
Rozzlobing districts protested in front of the building.
According to the police's statement, the neighbors' houses were surrounded by stone and their responses were markedly explosive.
However, local citizens claim that the mobile brigade (the Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at a man and killed him.
"We were panicked, we were afraid to pay off," said the 29-year-old Doming Badi, who lives near the hospital and was a witness to the arrival of the wounded.
"I haven't gone home in two days."
The Deiyaski Parliament called for the arrest of the police involved and the arrest of a mobile brigade from the area.
Ladies were always blind to the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the decision-making of indigenous peoples Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in central regions.
Many of them joined in the hunt for the liberation of Papuai (OPM) - the armed forces of the builders who protect the rights of the Papuans by attacking and persecuting the Indonesian police.
Some of the leaders of OPM come from Spain. They are not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
As a result of the military attacks in recent years, thousands of Paniai's citizens have been arrested and detained voluntarily, all within the meaning of "ensure national welfare".
Some of them don't look any more.
Ladies and gentlemen, the people of Papua are known as "the tragic and forgotten place".
Oil brings poverty into the fire.
This little rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for locals.
And the bread is still inexhaustible.
Older citizens feed their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leaves.
Women work in the fields; each makes four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of them are exclusively intended for the needs of families, others are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sugarcane are only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since the opening of several air routes to Nabire airport and new immigrants to the country, economic inequalities between the native Papuans and immigrants have grown.
So little jobs are usually made up of more educated and rich immigrants.
Papuanans sometimes have the necessary capital and education to let themselves into business.
"Young people are moving away from the neighborhood because of the lack of employment opportunities and money," said John Gobai, President of the Council of Ministers of the European Union.
Because of isolation, the province of Papua is hidden before the world.
They also contribute to strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were welcomed from the pope because of "the lack of cooperation with the authorities", despite the fact that they received such a rare permission to film.
Phelim China, the representative of the Asian Districts of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi, in his election campaign, promised to break strict rules for journalists and for achieving transparency and development.
"For the marginal journalists working in the remotest regions of Papua and Western Papua, there is a great risk: the lack of visas and blacklisting," he said.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that international pressure on the Indian side of Papua is significantly limited.
In March six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - UN Human Rights Council on the investigation of “various and widespread violent acts” in Papua, including bombings in Spain.
These countries in the past also supported OPM.
A spokesman from the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Armanath Nasir complained to journalists in Jakarta that "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and the media are free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations."
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, in front of a human rights envoy Kees Van Baarem, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people called on the source that also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the word "we want freedom".
Other elections are planned in Indonesia for 2019, but the popes claim they will not like Jokwi.
"Jock is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people connected with the gun in Spain," said Gobau, the head of the tribal council.
He wants Jok to know that the citizens of Spain - besides living in constant fear of the armed forces - are fighting poverty, poor education and a health system.
Gobai claims that the people of the Lord, like the other Papuans, consider their voice to be “a debt”, which Jacob must pay.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite threats and threats from family victims of panic attacks, the last symbolic act continues: they bury the victims on the ground against police and military stations.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least it will not allow responsible persons to forget their crimes.
"He was killing a member of our family," said Yacobus with his head covered.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy has attracted a huge supply of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy maintained in Tichomore a yacht of 1,46 tonnes of cocaine worth $256 million.
The ship headed for Australia.
A four-member crew of ships, apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia, was arrested.
Another, named Afalina, emerged from South America and the police took her to the port in Nouméa, a metropolis of the French coastal area of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian Reporting Service stated that in cooperation with its international partners, it will work to determine exactly where and where drugs were directed and to remove the "Live Syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped a large number of drugs leading to Australia," her executive director Col Blanch said.
The drugs were destroyed this week in Noumea.
Australia is due to high street prices of drugs an attractive target for their feeders.
The country is also dealing with the growing problem of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current bond is not the first one in the last time.
Last month three men were charged with transporting a large number of drugs from the United States to Australia, trying to cross the Pacific in a small plane.
Seniors don't have to feel jealous, they need to be reminded.
The problem may be home to seniors, according to doctors from Geriatric clinics General faculty hospital in Prague Pavly Mádlö could be infusion of a physiological solution that is
But they still apply only to medical devices.
The older the person, the more the amount of water in his body.
"And also the loss of emotion is severe, so seniors generally take less fluid and are very quickly dehydrated," Mádlová said.
Two liters should definitely drink.
"But getting to an old man so much fluid is a big problem," she added.
In nursing homes, it is often not looked at by any doctor.
In hospitals, dehydrate usually resolves with infusions.
"I think that even there should be a step forward so they can get subcutaneous infusion," she said.
In one day, it says that older people can add up to two half-carcases of physiological solution.
A lack of fluid can cause nausea, headache and decreased performance.
Dehydration appears to be a simple loss of consciousness.
"One day that old man will say he can't get up from bed talking nonsense," she added.
In case of failure, it may even lead to brain damage.
The blood gets stuck and the tube gets stuck in the brain, it's also a threat to renal failure.
Sleeping patients should not be covered by peririne, maximum bacillus.
The problem can also be one-time lungs.
"It's more like a curer, but it would be ideal for a patient to open up sometimes and let the skin grow," said the doctor.
The Torch is already burning in Dubai.
In Dubai on Friday he saw one of the world’s largest residential blacksmiths. The Hasikhs had to evacuate all the inhabitants 337 meters high and 79 patrol buildings.
In the last two years, there has already been a second fire on this high building, which is called The Torch (The Torch).
They were evacuated by all the residents of the building, and there was no harm. The cause of the fire is unknown.
"We fell asleep and woke up the alarm. We heard a call.
It took us ten minutes before we ran down the 50th floor," he told Reuters Geroge, one of the people in the dark.
The Dubai Civil Defence indicated that fire was managed by fire fighters around four hours early (0:00 GMT), which continued to ease the building.
The government representatives added that they are providing a replacement accommodation for the citizens who have arrived.
The incident could again draw up a discussion on the safety of materials used to store high buildings around the world.
As a result of the investigation initiated by Torch after fire in 2015, it was found that the most damaged coatings and outer panels were used for decoration or insulation.
The British police indicated that the London Greenfell Tower system could contribute to the rapid spread of fire by red fire, where nearly 80 people were killed.
The results of the investigation showed that more than one of the five passengers to the United States is carrying out prohibited items on the deck of the aircraft
A survey among passengers showed that more than twenty per cent of them were deliberately or unwittingly passing prohibited items through the U.S. government agency Transport Security Administration on deck. At least six per cent of passengers entered the airport deck with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers claim to have found that they have been travelling slowly with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
As a result of the investigation carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - which responded to more than 1,000 questionnaires - it showed that there is a greater likelihood of breach of the rules in younger travellers.
Of respondents who admitted that they had tried to travel knowingly with the TSA-bound object, 19.7 per cent of those travelling with several thousand hours were compared to less than 15 per cent of the members of Generation X.
Among the most common items that have been ignored by TSA are food and alcohol.
More than three per cent of respondents were deliberately subjected to a serious threat, while 2.2 per cent of the women interviewed and 3.7 per cent of the men interviewed also admitted that they had deliberately taken drugs at the airport.
The company indicated that it carried out an investigation between passengers around the world in order to determine how many of them were duly subject to unauthorized air traffic control and how much it had done voluntarily.
It is not surprising that most people who have transferred unauthorized items - whether known or not - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what currents and how much they can fly into the plane.
It is not surprising, therefore, that TSA has played in the largest number of illegal liquids.
At some point, people thought that TSA would be loaded with books the same way as with pasta.
The transport of liquids is permitted within the framework of Turkish flights, no international.
Chief EPA Scott Pruitt on the reduction of planned guidelines to reduce the emissions of Obama Administrative
After the Agency for the Protection of the Living Environment was called upon by fifteen States, its Chief Scott Pruitt rejected its previous decision on the resurgence of the former Obama Administration’s plan to reduce CO2 emissions.
Pruitt has submitted changes to his plan. It responds as milder than previous governments respond to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge presented against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This concerns the last deadline set on 1 October when States should begin to comply with the 2015 Regulation to reduce the amount of terrestrial ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that the agreement will be postponed by one year and will order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "intentions with local decisions or threats to economic growth".
Pruitt, who, before he was appointed Head of the EPA, President Donald Trumpe, has been in the position of State Prosecutor General Oklahoma for a long time served as a reliable supporter of more stringent environmental regulations.
Since his stay in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly overrun or removed the regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industry.
The immediate middle office is the biggest legal failure for the Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month a federal appeal court in Washington decided that the EPA executive has been trying to remove the Obama administrative plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce their metal waste.
In a statement issued in the middle of the evening, Pruitt proposed its version of ozone standards and strengthened EPA's commitment to cooperation with States through complex processes and compliance with new standards within the time frame.
"The previous EPA administration has often failed to meet the deadlines and waited for a complaint from active groups and other groups to agree with the comparison and other plans," Pruitt, who submitted more than a thousand applications to EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in the regulation by means of a court dispute and we take it seriously.
We never complain about our Statute and the authority that comes from it."
However, the EPA declaration states that Pruitt may use in a particular paragraph "the possibility of transit and all other legally available authorities", in order to ensure that the regulations "will be based on sound policies and best information".
The Republicans at the convention are pushing for a broader list of ozone rules.
The budget of the White House, approved last month, shall be at least eight years after the implementation of the 2015 rules.
The measure has not yet passed by the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was standing in front of the coalition of states that complained this week by EPA, stated that the group did not agree to allow legal pressure.
"To look at EPA - following our trial - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly involved in air pollution," Schneiderman added.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
The ground area results when normal harmful substances are released by cars, electricity, oil refineries, chemical electricity and other sources react with sunlight.
The resulting drought can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health and environmentalists welcome the profound change in Pruitt's attitude.
"It is disturbing what pressure must be put on us to change the thinking of responsible people and to protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to deal with the ideological burden of the Trupo administration, which is trying to help polluters and special interests."
He's a man of oxygen, but he's not safe in court.
You never know what might happen to you.
One moment you're home with your family, and you're laughing, the other one suddenly changes your whole life from base.
And the worst thing is that you can't do anything about it.
A similar judge met Andrease Christopherose of Great Britain, whose face was covered with acid unknown attacker who was finally forgiven of his sin.
The information was introduced by the Web Reuters.
In December 2014, someone at Christopheros locked the door.
Andreas admitted he was going to open it.
He was worried that there was probably a cook at the door who was supposed to give a Christmas present for the family that day.
Instead, he was faced with a cruel surprise.
The man he never saw in his life, immediately after he opened the bottle of oxygen without warning, said: "That's for you, my friend."
That disease was irreprehensible.
My clothes broke like nothing and I felt just an ineffective skin disease," Andreas said.
His family rushed him to the hospital, but his relatives learned a terrible message - according to doctors, he had no chance to survive.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were continually afraid that their patients would be subject to infections that threatened to break into his wound.
His injuries were very serious.
Ninety percent of patients have been infected with a face that doctors have tried to add to their skin by using other parts of the body.
A great deal of trouble for Christopher has become the loss of the eye cells.
It's probably the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide in front of an unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he wrote his suffering.
Today, Christopher has twelve operations that are not far from the last.
Patients suffering from oxygen attacks may require hundreds of surgical steps and years of treatment according to plastic surgeons.
Even after accidental and long-term treatment, victims are severely exposed to the end of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't give up and they've been fighting for the rest of their lives against deformation and neglect," said Professor Peter Djeewulski, speaking the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic surgeons.
The fugitive's online.
With regard to the attack, Christopheros is sure that an unknown man had to deal with someone.
Pachatel also believed that there was a lot of men who abused his close friend sexually.
The whole case was thoroughly investigated by the police and the attacker was later excommunicated.
A man was originally sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison.
However, after a while, the value of Christopher’s family changed substantially.
"The three judges finally concluded that the sentence should be abolished, because the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
In recent years, the number of attacks on animal substances has increased significantly.
The Ministry of the Interior has expressed its intention to set out new guidelines for state representatives on the classification of raw materials.
You should be among the dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks do not agree to surrender.
They require the British government to impose more severe and more severe penalties on people who attack their environment with oxygen or other animal substances.
They also require precise controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often used to obtain in different trades, because it is a matter of different cleaning means.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai burned on the night of the famous Murakorap The Torch, which belongs to the world’s largest residential building.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence, the citizens of the eight-story buildings were allowed to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to the spokesman, the Dubai police fired a fire in the ninth floor and spread it up.
According to some residents of the house, however, it was the opposite.
"It started in the 67th floor, so we were told," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant, quoted by the Reuters agency, fire broke out in the highest floors and spread down with falling raindrops.
We're asleep.
He woke us up, people shouted.
"We were running down the stairs, it took us about 50 yards, about ten minutes," said the tenant George.
Another witness for CNN estimated that the flames had captured about 40 apartments.
At least two cars were destroyed on the ground when they were hit by the burning parts of the building.
About two hours later, according to a civil defense report, the fire came under control.
The cause of his origin is still unknown.
According to the witnesses in the surrounding buildings, there was a flood.
The Torch also destroyed over a hundred apartments in the summer of 2015.
There are about 680 apartments throughout the building.
Even then, nothing happened to anyone because it was done to evacuate at times.
Mrakokorrap The Torch was established in 2011 and then became its 352 metres tallest building world.
The record was prepared immediately next year by another dubian blackhead.
The culturist was in the body of incredible 14 doping substances.
He didn't win anyway.
According to the list of Corriere della Serra, in the example of Ippolita of thirty-year-olds, there was a clear collection of illegal means - from steroids through diuretics following Parkinson’s disease or anorexia.
Even this strange mix didn't help him with his title, ended fourth.
Now, culturalists are at risk of four years of distance and criminal continuance.
The record was 11.
Loni was an Italian rapist Davide Vasta positively tested on 11 doping materials, which was at that time the record quantity of the arrived athletes.
A third player started taking steroids a year ago when he lost his culture.
Lucka Vondračk in Czech Republic.
She's been dealing with an ex-Millian!
Sovva Lucka Vondračková stepped into the territory of Česka, he's in one wheel.
And he's also paying attention wherever he comes.
The last time she got caught was her ex-Michael Michal Longy, with whom she lived for three years.
Herec was 12 years old at the time and had been charged with family.
Lucía was only 19 years old at the time, and she didn't have to take up her career at the funeral.
So they left, but friends stayed here today.
This was also demonstrated at a TV Prima press conference where they met for a long time.
They've both been in a good mood for the blue color.
At first they didn't notice each other, but then they got closer, and Lucie laughed at Michael's cousins when she fell asleep.
Then they've already met, and they've been willing to call the photographers.
However, their meetings were not an accident, they are playing together a couple of miles in the new series of Prime Minister Exner.
Islamists have gained life in Great Britain for the preparation of the attack.
On Thursday, the British court sent four members of the Islamic cell who said three men were planning a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
Four men, two of whom participated in the training camp in Pakistan and were already sentenced for similar effects, were arrested in August.
At the time, the authorities thought they were going to get caught immediately.
In one of the men's cars, security agents found part of a bomb bomb ready for launch, knives with letters that mean "unbelievers" in Arabic and a pack of guns.
It happened at the time when an MI5 Secret Service agent was stationed in the car with the listening device.
"Recent attacks have shown what a threat the complainant could have caused if they were not stopped," said Sue Hemming's prosecutor.
Three evaluations aged 28, 25 and 33 may apply for release after twenty years.
The fourth judge, who is 38 years old, can do it after 15 years behind bars.
During the process, men in London announced that they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were planted by an agent MI5.
The court also listened to her, but then rejected the claim of the defendants.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
For Hodoninska, 38.3 °C was intended.
The internal temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained on the spot for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees of Celsia, which was recorded in The Watch Tower of Hodoninsk, she won the fourth day, which has become the most intense day of the year.
They confirmed it by the workers of the Czech hydrometric institution.
On the other hand, on the other hand, there were not many hot records on Thursday.
In the afternoon, records of 35 of 145 meteorological stations were over 30 years old.
In the fourth quarter, recorded record temperatures were only nine long-term measuring stations.
Perhaps the fourth temperature in the Watchtower was the same as the previous record in 2013.
In the Netherlands on Thursdays 37.4, the original maximum of four decades was exceeded, and in the Netherlands, the current 37.1 level exceeded the record of three decades.
Both records have been published in The Watchtower since 2013.
The west was about ten degrees less.
High temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia on Thursday.
After the Watchtower there was the biggest road in the Dyjákovices on the South Sea and the ship over Dyjja on the coast of Bréclavka, where there was a steady flow of grain at 37.8 degrees, but the record did not pass.
On the contrary, for example, in Western and North-West Czech countries, the CHHMU web site has been only around 22 degrees Fahrenheit [- 22 ° C].
"The temperatures started to grow there until now in the afternoon," the meteorologists reported.
The current fleet in the Czech Republic will be gradually reimbursed according to the CHAMU and will be able to reach even more significant rains on Sunday.
Most of Moravi, but high temperatures will remain on Friday and on the southeastern part of Moravia and on Saturday.
There's a lack of tourists in China.
Peking for visa policy is about billion.
China has been trying to apply its influence after a decade without using powerful means.
It spends $10 billion annually on support for language schools and university construction abroad, pushes its entertainment industry on foreign markets and tries to attract Western tourists.
But it won't happen to Beijing.
The dark state media are talking about the plan to make from tourism the driving force of economic change and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals rose by 3.8 per cent and 80 per cent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macaa and Tchaj-wana.
It is also caused by the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners in the same way as open hand, an assessment of the situation in the most prosperous country of the world's professor of economy from the Beijing University of Christopher Balding in an article for the Bloomberg agency.
For example, he's talking about everything is a Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have an visa-free relationship with China, which the rest of them have to carry out a visa.
The Chinese authorities in the United States are therefore tax-compliant to the celebration of the new year.
The vision is $140, but if a person doesn't want to wait long hours at the front, he has to pay $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic barriers.
Studies in the Journal of Economics and Finance have shown that the need for visas reduces the number of visitors to the country by 70 per cent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited China, while Hong Kong, which shares less than three per cent of China's gross domestic product and lives less than one per cent of all citizens, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem itself when tourism uses its political goals, such as in the races with Tchay-wan and South Korea.
When China took over transport to South Korea in the context of the conflict around the South Korean counter-attack system, the South Koreans paid for it and China fled.
In May the number of visits dropped by 42 per cent, while Japan reported an increase of 85 per cent.
This all affects macroeconomic stability.
According to recent reports published by the U.S. Central Bank Fed, China was able to leave China as a result of its foreign travel to China at up to 190 billion dollars, while China, as a result of the sale of exchanges to tourists, annually earns about $35 billion.
According to the official figures for the development of the payment balance, then China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism for a long year, equivalent to 44 per cent of the entire Chinese surplus in trade with goods.
Thus, a small number of tourists from a country that is highly resistant to the decline in capital are causing a very painful wound.
However, the above factors are only one demonstration of more general sustainability for foreigners.
In many places of China, though, no one has heard of immigrants in practice.
In 2013 there were fewer than a million foreigners living throughout China.
They have more of them in the United States and some individual cities.
And Japan, which is not exactly a cross-country skirmisher, has a double seat.
A number of scientific work, however, shows that immigrants are usually boosting economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
However, you will not find it practical in China.
The solution to these problems will be politically advantageous, but the step being taken is to simplify the visual device.
Other Asian states, especially India and Vietnam, have recently developed a strong effort to simplify and simplify visa-sharing procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their sharp changes, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the swimming zone, death - dealing beaches multiplied.
The Plenary Kingdom of Plenary can be enjoyed by the young immediately three rare, dying beaches.
The visitor's exhibition is currently only seeing all nine pure Turkish snakes born.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, which is also located at an altitude of 2,000 metres.
"Beautiful and metro depth," said the speaker zoo Martin Vobruba.
Young people of the other two types, dying and red bodies, will be gathered into the garden of Eden.
We can't say when people see them yet.
"We wish we could come about them," said surgeon Miroslav Dohnal, who could take two years or two.
The Australian mortal snakes came into the world eight, these are the descendants of a couple of behavioral couples from the population around Sydney.
"The only one that visitors can see in the exhibition belongs to the mortals around Perth," Vobruba said with the fact that in human care there is a need for a 6-8 weeks winter at the temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
Hundreds of success has been achieved by African floating red cubes.
The couple in the beach zone had grown out of four eggs all four young.
"Incubation lasted 65 days," added Vobruba.
This species in nature emits one of its victims, which is up to four meters away.
He's looking at his eyes. He can cause permanent blindness.
Young people of all three species live in the zoo with mice.
Up to 40 days in the garden are still waiting for the young men from the black mummie's nest, the eggs are placed in the incubator.
According to an unverified record of telephone conversation, Trump creates pressure on Mexico because of the border wall payment
US daily Washington Post published a list of phone calls from President Trump with leaders from Mexico and Australia.
In a telephone conversation on 27 January, Enrique Peñou, Mexico's President, Nietem, urged her Trump to stop crying publicly that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed building.
The president of the United States read to him that he was publicly dissociating the building of the wall, probably saying, "You can't talk like this in print."
In the framework of his campaign, the trumpeter promised to set up a wall along the southern border and announced that he would pay for it in Mexico.
His first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbul was also rejected by the public, revealing his written exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. surveillance agreement on refugees headed to Australia is "mocky" and "dark" and insisted that if he agreed with such an agreement - which came to the government of President Obama - would appear to be "drug" after he proposed an entry ban on refugees into the United States.
The trumpet call ended after Turnbull explained that "this is my most pleasant day's speech".
Tusk told the prosecutor again about Smolenska.
"I am afraid of what," said the President's brother, President of the Government of Law and Justice of PiS Jaroslaw Kaczinński, at Tusk's address.
"I don't fear, Kaczinski doesn't fear me," Tusk replied and told the country's current leadership that justice is trying to abuse political opponents.
When he left the office of the prosecutor, he was waiting for Tuska on TV TV 24 taxes that were scandalous by Donald Tusk! and wanted politicians for hundreds of years!.
Tusk thanked for his support and made sure that he had a clean conscience: "I have nothing to fear and I am not afraid of Kaczinski."
The prosecutors do not read anything according to their words, but they do not doubt that justice has to serve as a tool against opponents, opponents or people who do not like it, and I fear that I belong to this group.
He's already got a second.
The expremir was heard on the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time he had to express his doubts about the drinking victims of the Slim disaster.
In addition, the body was replaced by the bodies in the arms.
Family members were forbidden to open a rap sheet and had to have some reason to do so.
And it was because they were afraid of scandals because he was going to trouble Polish-Russian relations.
"Keeping good relations at every price, despite such terrible events, should serve to make Donald Tusk a very important part of the EU," Kačinski said on Catholic television Trum.
He added that the possible conflict with Russia would lead to Turkey's chances of gaining the most important cross in the Union, from which there is nothing at all in Poland.
At the same time, Kaczinski announced that he had warned German Chancellor Angel Merkel that Donald Tuske might like it differently, but she didn't take it for granted.
The case was an eight-hour hearing on the prosecutor's office on April 19th.
He didn't even speak as a suspect, just as a witness.
However, many of his motions for a hearing considered Turkey to be part of the apparent efforts of the Polish government and the head of PiS Kaczinské to entrust Turkey as a political rival to various scandals.
The prosecutor is a Minister of Justice in Poland who plays a role in the role of the Prosecutor General.
The motion for a resolution was made after Turkey's election as head of the European Council, to which Kačinski was actively trying to prevent, among other things, from visiting Mercel in Warsaw.
Only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová was finally protesting at the EU summit against extending the Turkish mandate.
In this case, Warsaw left the girls and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Barma and Senegal.
Where can they love Chechnya everywhere?
In the lower parliamentary elections, the registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the talks from Barmy, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections which took place in 2013.
It's from a statement that manages the delivery of ballot papers to a stranger.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update, and is currently in the memoranda.
Four years ago he voted for a delegation in a foreign country of 10,000 Czech citizens.
"Since the last update of the statement in 2013, there has been some changes to be taken into account in these lists," explains the Ministry of Finance.
"In some countries new representative authorities have emerged, some authorities have been closed, where appropriate, to change the level of representation," says the material.
The list shall contain two Annexes, of which are first mentioned by the representative authorities to which the ballot papers are supplied.
This group of authorities includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot card in the press version.
They're just on their list with a list of changes.
Four years ago, Czechs could choose, for example, the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic also withdrew its representation in the Malaysian Bahamas and Japan.
He won't even be at the General Consulate in Donic.
This Czech Republic closed in 2014 due to the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are new on the list of ambassadors in Kenyan Nairobi, Senegal’s capital of Dakar and Zambian Lusaka.
In Asia Česko since the last parliamentary elections has expanded its representation on the general Consulate in Iraq Irbil and Čcheng, the capital of the Chinese province of S'-Čchuan.
Voting lists will also be available for registered voters at the Czech Embassy in Barmé and Cambodia.
They had the opportunity to select the emissaries in the polling stations at the representative offices or consulates four times before.
Before any elections, the National Electoral Commission shall determine the country for which its candidates are voting abroad.
This was first in 2002, when it was decided between South Moravia candidates.
At the next two elections, Czechs were elected to a foreign position among South-South candidates.
In 2013, the Middle East was elected the same year.
The number of Czechs voting in foreign is steadily increasing.
A total of 3800 people were voted by the Prime Minister 15 years ago, about 6700 in 2006, four years later, 8222.
In the course of the previous snowfall elections four years ago, 10,571 voters were sent to the embassy.
Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: activists remembered racist links
Ford Mercuriy from 1948 traveled around the following inhabitants of Monroe, Georgia and codordal to the Moore's Ford bridge.
However, before the four black passengers and the white driver were able to reach the bridge, a group of white men armed with weapons made their way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in the torn-out suit - was long gone from cigarettes and looked at the front of the car.
There's a fear in the traveling trip.
"We want it n--a Roger!" cried the man.
"Bring him to me!"
Quietly interrupts the young black man's nose, which is removed from his partner's seat.
This scene is the only reconstruction event that occurred on 22 July.
But when one of the men passes through the "Roger's" cross-section, the promise will blow up.
Since 2005, Moore's Ford has returned to the bridge regularly a group of activists who rebuild that Friday night in 1946 when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by Kukluxklan.
No one's ever been tried for murder.
“It is with the conviction that for all these years there has been no single person imprisoned – although we still see them in our community; even if we know their identity,” Tyrone Brooks, who helps to restructure the events.
"It's a mystery to our history and a burden to our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old Congressman in the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights fighter.
In his eyes, he presents the reconstruction of the event as a dramatic challenge to driving, and every year the city of Monroe reminds itself that justice has not been done enough.
"We call for judicial action and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice is above all," Brooks said.
"The healing and reconciliation process cannot be started until then."
The judge hides one of the victims of murder at Moore's Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI, which received a report from the NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding periods were to be enrolled.
But no one's ever been tried.
Although the suspects remain free after ten years, civil rights activists claim that both reasons for dating - politics and sex - were known to all citizens.
In June 1946, citizens of the highest court of the state of Georgia were given the first right to participate in the elections scheduled for the year.
And just during the summer elections, according to the FBI, a black farmer had Roger Malcom's plates during the pontoons to hand over the owner of the land's white plates Barnetta Hestera - probably because of his wife.
In the city, according to Brooks, Hester had argued with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and brought her to another state.
According to the FBI, on 25 July 1946, the former important owner of the land of the White Plains Loy Harrison for Malcoma made up $600.
He was taken to the prison by Dorothy and my cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their return from prison, just before the ride to Moore's Ford bridge, a group of suspects took their way.
"As it turned out, he planned and organized murder," said the FBI.
"It is also evident that a secret agreement has been reached between state and local law defenders who have not only participated in the signing but have also escaped evidence and have protected the identity of witnesses."
Brooks has more expertise on the whole matter.
"It was a massacre because of the law of choice," he said.
“There has always been a clear subtext for all local residents of black villages: ‘This is how you will like it if you register and go on volit’.”
Each year the event reconstruction at Moore's Ford bridge is organised by Cassandra Greene.
Its presentation is graphic, poetic and lofty. It shows deep-rooted racism, which many would like to see in modern America as extinct.
Following this reconstruction is not easy and it's even harder to turn off the air, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hidden in each of us," Greene said.
"But there can't be a relationship between us if you don't hear what I had to go through."
The main trials of this year's reconstruction began in June, and immediately on the first day about 30 heroes - thousands of whites, the rest of black - packed into the room where Greene's met with a very carefully planned presentation.
Wade Marbaugh is in the position of Assistant Director.
For many years the leader of Kukluxklan has played, but according to his word, it's an exhilarating role.
"I have a bad feeling because it contradicts who I am," said Marbaugh.
"I think it is very important to remember this part of the story regularly, because we never want to go back to such a time."
Herci Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcolm, the leader of Barnett Hester, are training their roles.
The presentation starts with the script - Malcom agrees with Hester and blames him for having sex with his wife.
"Get out of my land--e!"
Rascona's gone.
He's coming to the bathroom.
At that moment, everyone (at least every heretic of black wings) will blow up in laughter.
Greene's laughing at everyone.
"What happened?" Rascon asked.
He's confused.
Was I too rough?
"No," replied Greene's joy.
"I just don't think the whites used to say "n-r" to such a tone."
"Exactly," one of the heroes shouts black applause.
"You have to pay more attention to R."
The energy in the room is much better; hostility is rewarded by a feeling of closeness.
They all want to be an authentic presentation, just to be made for a few four victims of mass massacre.
The heroes repeat the scene.
Rascona this time focuses on the correct expression of the word N.
No one laughs now.
The presentation ends with violence and fast.
Grev, they shot... and there's still silence.
Women dressed in black stand above the bodies of the heroes and drink a boring song by Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit".
With every word there's a feeling of sadness in the room.
On the back of all of this, about a thousand spectators lose their way and tears from their eyes.
There are practically the same number of blacks and whites in the promise.
A couple traveled from New York City, many of them from nearby areas.
Each of them enjoys the local humidity of about eight hours, and Brooks is in the process of leading to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
By this time the murder could have been viewed as a departure, but now, standing at the same place where it came to be chained, the atmosphere is terrible.
With the last words, the song calls Greene's tax on inspection of the body.
The children go to the victim's head, follow false blood and no moving bodies, and get something into their ears.
"They're not dead," says the little boy.
He's gonna run for a few minutes and Greene's thanks for the promise.
The Herpes turn on the lano and shake the tears.
Bradshaw covers Marbaugha, a man in his suit who played the head of Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona will include two of his friends-herders and will be paid in their hands; finally, emotions come to him.
"It's okay," one of the women said.
“We know you have this role to play.
But you had reason for it."
Later that same day, she will have her engagement with the Hermione for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple are engaged in talking to a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski's nephew found a word that would express her feelings from today's presentation.
“It’s difficult to listen to these hurtful words and look at the disgusting effects... that rob people who look like you and do it because they look like you,” she said to the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that dating is still an ongoing topic," he added, "only police lines are called him."
On the other hand, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courthouse, enjoying dinners and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he's already begun to plan the presentation for next year.
"Reconstruction of these events is inspiring, as it describes the fear we had to live - but it is just a moment to think," he said.
"If we don't learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who don't know and study the history of their country are inclined to turn to it."
I love the instructions to use.
One of my friends says that the instructions for using only snakes are read.
I don't agree, though.
It's one of the modern forms of art, often drawing surrealism.
With nostalgia, I remember a long time ago, where the guidance to use anything was rather rare.
So maybe my first gramophone contained only one paper, on which were hieroglyphics showing involvement of certain parts, all had some secret signs.
When I was shown something inside after years, I offered that letter to the shamman who was not afraid to unload the back desk.
He gave me advice on what the paper with the labyrinth is worth.
Yeah, it's about the usual help at the time of the suspension of the toilet paper.
The game found a broken wire and allowed me to listen again to expensive vinyl plates.
A new era has brought new guidelines.
And relatively simple fruit repellent, where he just held a cross-section, required about ten images.
In particular, it was a plan with a description of how to insert one part into another.
The adjustment was double and the other procedure was simply not possible.
It required considerable effort to separate certain plastic parts.
My backup of the instructions ended in my car with the Seat Leon sign.
The year of production 2003 was still a book with the indication of minor repairs, which included other changes in bunker vegetables.
It was simple.
All three steps and the work should be done.
Unfortunately, the author recalled that while the garden was actually going to change in only three steps.
1. Split the cover.
2. Wash your dirty stomach and prepare a new one.
The third cover.
The left ventricle had a problem like putting the battery cover.
At first I thought I'd put the right upper end of the vehicle into the wreckage of some truck, a screw with which it would be easy to remove and then I'd already run points 1-3 of the contested author of the service book.
I don't think so.
The cover had no place, no space, no space for the thick hands of Poppelčina, because of the obese Slezan.
I've lost half an hour of my life, and it's completely without any success.
The state was still strengthened by my wife's entry into the garage, which called for the rain and words that heard from my mouth completely exceptional.
"What are you doing here?" she asked bitterly.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I leave the terms of the vow, there were only two published words.
I'm having a fever.
"And why does it take you so long?" she threatened a world that could be her last in the long-term wedding.
I gradually explained the problem to her, and I was primarily referring to the author's torture process, where the burning of the fire-fired iron on her hand, which she wrote, followed by her easing that he could never write anything anymore, was the only introduction to the wide range of Cladiva's instructions on the witchry, including his commissional burning on the top of the Losin castle.
"What's going on to unmount this carbide?" said a woman who thought she was building a battery.
In the fourth century, it came to this and then steps 1-3 were as easy and fast as on the right side.
I thought it wouldn't surprise me.
And that's the day he called my colleague who just got out of the collapse situation after two of the State Medicine Control Agency's offices.
I know her as a colleague of an equal person who has lived in the area as possible and impossible and who is able to explain the strange stories with an unexplained voice.
"I imagine I've got a feeling I haven't raised my hand in my hand," he told me with a weak voice.
I gradually got rid of it all of the problem that caused me to feel that there's no visual guidance on the patient's toilet over my head.
Its argument to the Commission authorities that they are mature with rules is capable and that there is no need for icons to control the activities of the common people, had no influence on them, and was unable to make any money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that the simple relief of the molten waves of current water is a primitive act at the level of chromany, that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, conducts this order in ten steps.
So it's necessary to tell you it's necessary to leave the bucket of water.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but it's finally a happy discovery that a man has touched his hand just as he arranges for his host from SUKL.
Finally, I have to admit that I've let myself breathe and I'm preparing a detailed plan for the operation of the toilet.
In the matter of decommissioning, there will be a single procedure, there will be no problem, given the certain difference between the two sides, there will be a need to raise two guidelines.
The problem remains those icons, because creating a perfect process means the exact range of all the anatomical details, which could lead to certain distortions in the original toilet visitor, despite the fact that he can finally learn that he has lost the proper opening throughout his life with a completely wrong procedure.
The Pearson company misses another 3000 employees and reduces the dividend in an effort to revive business
The British educational group Pearson said on Friday that it will drop another 3000 employees and reduce the temporary dividend by 72% in response to another restructuring programme with a view to changing the business model.
Another wave of neglect, which, according to Executive Director John Fallona, will come at the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019, follows the previous decision by the company to leave 4,000 employees within the framework of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to reduce costs of another 300 million pounds (394 million dollars) in May under the third cost reduction programme in an attempt to establish a trade-off due to rapid development of digital education.
The company which agreed last month to sell its share in the Penguin Random House of Bertelsmann stated that the annual outlook remained unchanged after it announced a one-percent increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Flight to battle in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed during a suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military war in the capital of Afghanistan Kabul. During the attack, one NATO soldier died and several others were injured, and official representatives were introduced.
Five soldiers were wounded and the pressure was mentioned in NATO's statement.
According to the informal reports of the attack in the city of Qarabagh, three civilians also died.
This month Afghanistan launched a bomb attack - more than 30 people were killed this afternoon during an explosion in the Herat Museum.
On Monday he killed a suicide attacker two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO stated in its statement that it arrived at the morning explosion after the observer was attacked by members of the Afghan army "by a local person with a sub-commissioned explosive device".
The declaration further states that all injuries to soldiers are beyond the risk of life and are located in the U.S. military hospital on the ground of Bagram.
According to the rapporteurs, the increasing power of the Taliban and groups known as the Islamic State (IS) in the area of Kararabagh is an important source of concern for NATO's related forces in the nearby Bahamas.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% of the victims died in the capital.
At the end of July the bomb killed at least 30 people in the Shia Kabul district.
The Taliban joined in the attack.
On May 31, he killed more than 150 people in the center of the city. This is the most deadly military attack in the country since the US government invaded the Taliban in 2001.
Violence is already submerged in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering an increase in the number of American soldiers who should help military units and police in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, suicide attacks have occurred which have occurred in recent weeks by public trust in the government, its regulations and in particular in the reputation of President Asrafa Ghanín.
EPA in response to the application reviewed its decision to distance smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency called for its decision on the repeal of the Obama Administrative Act, which ordered the States to reduce emissions, only the day after the Agency appealed to 15 countries.
At midnight, EPA announced its decision on the move to the "Ozone Standards 2015" that it would present a commitment of the Agency to cooperation with the States.
"We believe in dialogue with our public partners and listen to their views," said EPA Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA's efforts to remove ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, on the basis of measurement, determine the limits that must be met by October 2018.
A group of 15 from most democratic states, together with Washington, D.C., filed a complaint on Tuesday on the grounds that EPA is illegal.
President Donald Trumpa's administration is trying to block many environmental regulations that former President Barack Obama proposed - according to the words of the Trump Group in an effort to achieve economic growth.
However, the efforts of the new government have been initiated by anti-democratic and conservative groups that are afraid of the impact of emissions on public health.
EPA on its websites states that breathing air with ozone content “can decrease the function of the lungs and increase respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnar got the morning and shed blood!
This, in our relatively new song, you may have already registered in June of this year, when this song has now become almost unknown to us on the Czech dimensions of a monster action that he has hosted such former personalities as Mr. Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krain and a number of others, and did not modernise any other actions than Leoš Marès.
It was a simple goal to show to the public and present its music video clip to the song Sara, whose baptism was performed by the very mentioned personalities.
Few, however, know that the only video clip that took place in Russia was no problem and the only song Ladislav Bubnarar had to be burned.
It was his first big encounter with the stars of the Russian national ballet and didn't go without a proper trap.
The song Sara is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two miles.
For the dramaticness of the scene, he had to mark the touch of the fact in a video clip of songs.
At one point, however, he struck him so strongly and directly into the nose that the young singer had to heal the doctors.
"It was the morning, I didn't expect it, immediately I got out of my nose," Ladislav commented.
Fellows and producers said the situation was on the ground that it was an accident and that Ladislav was not able to respond at any time.
The injury was not so serious that it affected the continuation in another direction.
We're bringing you a young artist's video clip now, you can also record that scene with skill.
The unexplained version of blood, but it was no longer used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomačenko spoke at the meeting on the possibilities of mutual dueel
Vasyl Lomačenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could understate the most obvious boxer game in easy league, first met at the morning meeting.
Each of them was located in separate rooms at the ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia - an unencumbered champion in the easy league of the World Boxing Council - arrived down into the hall where he welcomed Lomanacenko, a champion in the peer union of the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia’s victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against the former four-year World Championship of Adrian Bronner on Saturday’s showtime, both boxers got on the list of five best boxers in easy league.
Garcia found her wallet and said: “How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
Lomančenko withdraws his title against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 19:00 p.m.
Boxeries take photos and manager Egis Klimas adds that the potential boxer file would be "a perfect test".
"I've been a champion in a peer league," Garcia adds.
“I had to collect because of a game with Broner (67 kg), but I'm not so big.
I'm 63 kg small.
I'd like to go back to the easy weight category.
The hunter has to go back to get a light weight... and then we can run.
That's what the fans are worried about.
Why don't you do it to them?"
He's in love with me.
"The box would burn this game."
The climate has created a demand for payment for observation - which is part of his strategy. Lomakenko should complete his debut in an easy league at the end of the year and the next year to meet Garcio (37-0.30 knots) who also expressed interest in the match against George Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who attend 23 September on the title of the easy league in the Forum.
"The game should be run by the style of the payout, it's called for by fans," said Garcia, who later expressed himself as an open opportunity to play the game through the television station, which will come with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else will take such care of himself.
We're waiting for the right chance...
Garcia stated that he recognizes Lomachen as "a wonderful boxer" and could participate in his Saturday game.
But the playmate didn't give up on Garcio's praise when he said that the champion three divisions from Riverside seemed "too slowly... sorry Mike, but you're saying about the end."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both of the boxers said they'd feel the tension in front of each other's duel.
"Only don't forget about this game.
No other game is so much attention.
And I'll add a lot of comfort to the fire," said Garcia.
He said, "I've been waiting for those best boxers and this is Mikey."
It'll be a great party."
A young couple of years ago disappeared without stopping.
Their cars are now found on Volgh's floor.
Two young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov have been missing since December 2005.
There's been an extensive patrol after them that failed.
And the police finally stopped the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in the dark that they didn't know what happened.
After 12 years, the sad ending of the whole story came.
Their car was hit by a wet hole on the bottom of the Volhy River in the city of Chebossary in Chuvaška.
Only thanks to the evidence that remained in the car, the police were able to identify a few.
The evidence survived the entire decade under water, without which the police would have to find out more about the identity of those found.
A couple was last observed when Zirnov bought a car from his father so he could get his friend out of work.
The trailer that the car discovered is still in the anonymity.
His find was reported by the Czech police, who drove the next day to the beach.
Researchers believe that the death of a young couple was an accident that caused the birth of an adult road along the river.
However, the investigation continues, further details will be published after its completion.
Latest results of tests to determine the age limit of asylum application in Sweden
The latest results of asylum testing in Sweden, which were detailed new method of ageing, show that more than 80 per cent of people were questioned as older than 18 years of age, but not everyone believes in their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (Rättsmedicalverket) began new tests at the beginning of this year.
The purpose of the methodology is to assess the indicators in the context of the assessment of asylum applications. The measure was adapted after the Swedish Migrationsverkt was criticised for seducing some refugees who lied about their age when determining the right age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests carried out from half March to 31 July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) was assessed as older than 18 years, while in the other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency found that the question was "probably older 18 years".
In other 423 cases, it was decided that the question was "maybe 18 years younger".
Tests shall only be made available if the age of the questioned dispute.
According to Johanna Göransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
"In contrast to last month's statistics are kept in closed wheels and numbers are very similar," he said for The Local.
The higher number of indicators, the age of which was estimated at 18 years of age, does not necessarily mean that asylum indicators lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and indicated that in 442 cases it was found that ‘the requested person is 18 years or older’.
Svenska Dagbladet studied 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the questionnaire indicated that he would be 18 years old.
Critics were also expected to determine the age of age, which includes the X-ray of the teeth of wisdom and the MRI scan of the knee clubs, which are followed by dentists and X-rayologists.
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who is also involved in examining the biological development of humans until the age of birth.
"I had reason to think about this problem and I do not think that these types of measures to assess age are correct.
The passing of the biological age is very uncertain in a certain sense.
If we can't determine the age with accuracy, we shouldn't pretend again," said Metro newspaper.
The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson called on the decision to say: “In general it can be said that the risk of misappropriating your child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person interviewed is strictly below the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 per cent of all questioned."
Trump threatened the president of Mexico's phone.
American President Donald Trump, in a cold phone call from Mexican President Enrique Pennó Niatt, threatened that he would not sit down with him if he would publicly say that his country would not pay for building a wall between the United States and Mexico.
The trumpeter said that the funding would be managed somehow, even if he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
At the same time, Trump spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbul.
That's what's going on in the conversation schedule published by the American Daily The Washington Post on Thursday.
The trumpet built a wall on the southern border for Mexican money with one of the main promises in its London premier campaign.
In the first conversation with the Mexican president shortly after his move to the function of Trump Pennë Nita, he was undemocraticly concerned that he was critical of his plan for building the wall.
The southern neighbor treated him as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this," Trump said again in his speech on 27 January and threatened to cut off contact with the Mexican President if he continues to issue a reproducing statement.
It's kind of like financing, and it's going to work well.
"But if you say Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to get in touch with your gentlemen anymore, because it's unacceptable to me," said American daily Trump.
The wall has, however, marked at least the important thing we're talking about, but politics may be the most important thing.
The executive order for the construction of the temple of Trump issued shortly after the power was taken away.
Mexico's construction and financing of the wall is rejected for 3200 kilometres, and therefore relations between the two countries have been broken down.
At the end of March, Trump said that the project would be paid by the United States.
The trumpet finally met with his Mexican opponent first on the June G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbul on January 28.
The head of the White House called the conversation a joke.
In conclusion, it adopted an exchange of views on the agreement that Australia would provide asylum to Central American refugees because the United States would adopt persons from international installations in the Pacific States.
The trumpet first considered it stupid, but later he joined it.
"You can certainly say that this is not the agreement you have made, but you will have to hold on to it," said Trump Turnbull.
In some passages, a telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost boring, for example when Trump considered it a good idea for Australia's refusal to accept refugees arriving in members.
"You're worse than me," said Trump.
But this is where the tone of the conversation is blown.
"I hate taking these people," observed Trump.
I assure you they're wrong.
That's why they're in jail now.
"There won't be great people going to work for local milkers," he said.
In the discussion, he also pointed out that a refugee can become an atheist in Boston in five years.
The storm led to the end of the winter, so the storm weeks after arriving at the White House, telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen, often and several times during one day.
The talk with Turnbul finally marked at least the most pleasant one for the whole day.
Before he finished, he found out he had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The murder of Rany was repaired before the tax.
Her father also came in.
The repair took place in the main town of Jemen Saná.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose little Rana Almatari who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kissed the girl, took her father's house where he raped her and raised her with his bare hands.
The next time he raped her body, he fell close to her.
The violent death of young girls has devastated the whole country, leading to the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari was in the first thousands of donations that he made to be a witness to repair.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under the law of Sharya.
The father of the victim told the media about his feelings after he recovered.
I feel like I'm born again.
I got caught.
It's my new day.
The other members of the family were present, along with the tax, calling out the word "to live righteousness".
The rapist brought the police supplies he had taken from.
The police stationed him on the bridge.
One of his officers turned his gun against him and fired the bomb from the immediate vicinity.
The next tax celebrated every morning that was burned.
Mr Almatari told the MailOnline web that justice was executed in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Alaah and the law of charm have won," he added.
I was standing at Sana's Rehab and waiting for my daughter's murder to be repaired.
Then we went to the convent with our family.
We took Ranino's little body and buried him in a nearby cemetery.
My wife and I are grateful that justice has been executed.
The police were afraid that the tax collected on the site would fall to hate madness, the murder would come down and break down.
The correction was made by a court which is governed by the Shiite Huts.
At first, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 wounds at the time of his arrest, but his action raised such a charge that the judge decided to execute him.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on 27 June.
The family's wounds knew him well.
When the police were looking for the door of his house, she found evidence that the husband was planning his action.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
And the animals would be more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies and the injury that hit Ranino's body was terrible," said the media.
"The morning was gone by afternoon, we were still reporting it to the police, we told the news and all our television stations, the posters with her photo were everywhere," he continued.
They all think the police got a guy from the killer parents who suspected their son of a horrible act.
The mother's daughter, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body had been found.
The early morning was playing outside with the other kids from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where it was.
We were looking everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took our cars and drove around, but we were looking for a way.
The inhabitants of Yemen were released from crime and began to gather before the police station where al Maghrabi was detained and to demand immediate punishment.
The representative of the Ministry of Justice read the present assessment report to calm it down.
The accused was not sorry about his actions.
Just before the execution of the sentence, the police had read his case, but the judge had just looked at his lawyer for a year.
The whole event was directed to national television, but on the Internet there were many records that he ordered tax.
The West Virginia Governor announced the political change
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening at the meeting of President Trump that he was moving to the other side.
" Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned to me behind," said the Governor Justice.
"I declare to you today after a long prayer and meditation... today as a citizen of West Virginia I say that I can no longer support you from the position of a democratic governor."
The presence of the following has been a source of joy.
"I will join the Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
The trumpet has already promised people to meet in West Virginia with important announcements.
The trumpet won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the whole country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice has acquired a great estate from his father and is the owner of a few undergrounds.
The value of his property is estimated at $159 billion.
On Thursday evening, the National Committee of the Republic issued a statement which stated: "The departure of the Governor of Justice is another morning for a democratic party that prevents us from going on our way instead of causing us to take our country."
"For a democratic party that has only 15 governors and at least rules the legislative authorities in history, the announcement of the Governor Justice is the last cap for an already defeated party without a leader who has been trying to find positive and synergy reports," said President RNC Ronna McDaniel in his statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe commends Russia's "true" apology for the doping scandal
The former outstanding sportsman Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for his sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that there has not yet been the right time for Russia to return to the sports world.
The head of the Russian athletes Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which was convened on the night before MS in the athlete - that his country was right from the world of sport and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He spoke of "all the athletes who came this way about gold and silver medals."
Despite its comments by members of the IAAF Congress, they voted for the ban which entered into force in November 2015 after Russia supported the doping of its athletes from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) reports.
"I think we have been very sincere in our responses and presentations today," IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All members of the Council and the Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia acknowledged its mistake and worked hard to correct and restore the proper functioning of the entire Federation."
Coe said he was also "happy" that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think we have been very generous today and have come to a different level, but the Congress supports the recommendation of a crisis stand on the detention of the punishment imposed on Russia," Coe added.
"In the coming months we must do everything to stabilize the situation.
Our effort has always been to separate positive athletes from these negative ones," he concluded.
On the MS in a game that starts on Friday in London, it will compete with 19 Russian athletes who have complied with IAAF's strict rules.
The head of the IAAF Rune Andersen crisis room said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet several criteria before it is allowed back.
Tests for the presence of drugs are still non-executive and trainers continue to carry out their activities, he told reporters in London after the IAAF Council's presentation.
The CzechTrade State Order received the company Františka Savova, whose state is approaching.
The public order of the CzechTrade State Proexport Agency received the issue of the Young Front of Františka Savova.
Officials have assigned it in all qualitative criteria a percentage of points.
They were not aware that the Czech State was reaching Savo’s tax base and asked him to go to the Czech Republic.
The pro-export agency of the CzechTrade Ministry of Industry and Commerce has issued a comprehensive public ban on four-year insurance of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The order totalled 30.8 million korunas received the edition of the Young Front of the company Františka Savova.
However, in 2014, the Czech police accused him of tax evasion and threatened him.
Savov flew to Great Britain and Česko asks for his release.
In the case, the server warned you at Current.cz.
In accordance with the original criteria of the CzechTrade, it had to decide from 60 per cent the price offered and from the remaining 40 competitions of beauty and the quality of the project.
As far as Savo’s company was concerned, that second criterion was particularly helpful.
According to the information Dotyk.cz, it has received one hundred points in all partial quality criteria.
This was the result of a new candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, who offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with a portion of 404,900 crowns per month, VLM offered 324,350 crowns.
Unlike the Young Front, it was obtained from the reviewers in all qualitative criteria by an average of 62 points.
Tendru has continued to participate in BDO Advisors and R-Media digital agency, which belongs to the same server as Currently.cz under the Department of Economy.
A number of objections to the outcome of the tender were raised by the GOC that its assessment was considered to be unfair and insufficiently justified.
Following their refusal, it was decided to attack a competition in the EEA Economic Competition Authority.
It is thought that the CzechTrade was in conflict with the law.
"The tenderer is convinced that the tenderer has reached a decision on the selection of the tenderer on the basis of the design of the subjective assessment, which is a single favour to the participant of the Youth Front, i.e., for tenderers and other tenderers," is written in a proposal to initiate the management of the EAGGF this week, which has been published by the server.
According to the President-in-Office of the VLM Michala Klími, the selection of the selection committee is considered to be an incredible and percentage of the evaluation of the Youth Front project by all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a remarkable success of one of the competitors to be unlikely and suspicious," he said to the Current Climate.
The CzechTrade has not yet been exposed to the situation.
The CzechTrade Agency does not generally issue public orders prior to their closure.
All information about your above-mentioned bans is published under the Law of the Prosecutor's Profile and in the Report of Public Orders.
"After the end of the ban, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the ban we cannot express ourselves to its process," said Dotyk.cz media representative of the agency Štěpán Longuğy.
The young front responded to a statement which, according to it, considers it extremely problematic that the issuer of the economy has entered an article in Current.cz into competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact was mentioned in that Article.
In the tent she could help by providing the BusinessInfo portal in the previous four years.
The ban was first imposed in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led by Martin Cuba ODS.
The French Savova police are responsible for tax damages related to excessive DPH payments to its company, which has caused damage to the Czech state to up to 770 million crowns.
Czech Republic has asked the United Kingdom to issue it since 2014.
According to Savova, he is the criminalizing chief of the ANO Andrej Babish, under whose influence is Mafra's publishership.
The London court denied Savovo's refusal to issue, but the company refused.
"From our point of view, there has never been a case since London, we from Great Britain have not received any interpretation of the case until now," said Mr Zenklov, speaking for Current.cz of the Prague City State Representative.
In addition to the property of the Young Fronty, Savov in the Harvestor Limited established a residence in Cyprus, which was owned by the Cheskobudjevic Pivovar Samson, and in the Cyprus company Maraflex, which is known as the investment fund, buying dangerous assets.
He should also be in charge of the fault company Heavy Machine Services, formerly Legios, which owes more than three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also involved in the execution of property from a former Socialist youth league.
The motorbike drove through the walkway and the park, ended up in the mud.
The engine drew attention to the sightless rides along the streets, walking and park roads in Süšović.
When the guard began to track him down, he decided to take her to the station.
"The police men followed with increased caution to the city when one of the next roads behind the Marians Lazne did not operate and the motorcycle drove into the field where he had been hacked," said police spokesman Daniel Dvorák.
Finally, he had to come to the accident with a lifeboat carrying an injured engine into a lung hospital.
The police later found that the engine did not own a driver’s license, the registration marks on the motorcycle were deleted, its production number cleared and its own production plate removed.
It's as likely that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is the subject of another investigation.
"The alcohol in the driver’s driver’s presence was excluded, but the test was found positive results on methamphetamine,” added the police spokesman.
How the financial rules of football affect the movement of Neymara to Paris
The rules restricting the financing of European football clubs do not affect Neymar's record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germany.
Any criminalisation for Paris Saint-Germain will be carried out by the EUFA organisation, which monitors European football teams and has the right to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Lise of Masters.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP ) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 provide that the PSG will have to prove that Neymar's move was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid EUR 222 million only in order to buy Neymara out of its contract and Neymar will require a payment of several million dollars a year.
It follows several financial conditions of Neymar's move to France.
In view of the fact that the PSG team is funded by a rich Atlantic family that has become rich at the sale of energy, Neymara can be allowed to lead to so many so-called star football families.
Clubs may lose to buy large-scale players, but on the other hand, they must show legal revenue sources, which enable them to cover the regulatory costs of football-related business activities.
The FFP appointed Michel Platini after reaching the UEFA director's office in 2007.
An ex-French player believed that clubs held by the new forces would ultimately undermine and risk banknotes if banks or owners refused to provide them.
In 2011, the rules of the FFP focused on the club debt to monitor their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovic with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and losing the horizontal sum for players y to build a global character - was not so useful at all.
During the current three-year pilot period ending in 2018, clubs may lose up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Alexander Čeferin was determined to appeal to the ban on excessive losses.
"The FFP provision continues to pay and we are deciding to strengthen it in the future," he said last week for Associated Press Andrea Traverso, which monitors compliance with the FFP rules.
Although the PSG has purchased the amount for the purchase of Neymara in one-time payment, the amount may be distributed for the purposes of calculating the amount for the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be recorded at EUR 44.4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of the highest sanctions FFP took place in 2014 with the PSG with Manchester City, which is the own group of Abu Dhabi.
The PSG committed a fine of EUR 60 million (€82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and the order for the reduction of the team of experts to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of 25 players.
The UEFA shall pay attention to the teams that may try to treat financial regulators by increasing their income through the company associated with the owners of the clubs.
Even if the Danish company sponsors PSG, where the financing exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA shall have the right to prohibit the calculation of the share.
In 2014, UEFA joined in its decision that the financial resources provided by Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team were too high.
The part of Neymar's revenue in the PSG could, according to some reports, be jeopardised by the MS Organisational Commission in the 2022 football field in Qatar.
The PSG and representatives of MS 2022 in Qatar, however, realized that Neymat should become a MS Ambassador in the football field and that such a manoeuvre would easily be invented by UEFY manufacturers.
The previous sanctions imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to enforce the rules,
According to the UEFA dedicated persons expressed yesterday, there was no investigation into Neymar's move to the PSG.
The source of this message was intended to remain anonymous, as it was not justified to comment on the situation with the PSG, the agency The Associated Press said.
The latest published accounts show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymara's arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and selling clothes.
The club promises to increase turnover by up to 30 per cent from the signing of the contract.
The representatives of the Spanish League, apparently concerned about leaving one of the largest stars, applied to measuring Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG violates the FFP rules.
“This is a clear case of the ‘financial doping’ club and the state,” said President La Ligy Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG club by the Atlantic trade union.
Director Arsenal Arsenau Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports magnet, shares the same position as La Ligy on funding the club.
"This is the consequence of the property that has changed the football world from base in the last 15 years," Wenger listened on Thursday.
“As soon as the owner of the club becomes a member of the club, everything is possible.
Keeping the rules of the financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have different interests for such players in its club."
Spartan Founder Russian: The changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Six thousand fans on the hill.
Thomas Rosicky's going to the beach.
Same scene as in the Sunday fight against Bohemians.
The Spartan founder fled to the Red Star game, invented a few heads, but his teammates did not intend to go into the black.
The Air Force team won by the new multi-millionaire forces after the start of the second round of European prizes.
Was it hard for me to do something else for the Whitehead?
Four shots had to be fired after the inexplicable gun, which was hard for us.
At least we wanted to stay out of play, raise our conscience so that we could reflect on what we'd like to see in other games.
We had some chance.
We have to work together as a team and play our game.
Why couldn't Sparta get to the game so long?
The game's very busy.
The rival combinations were much better than ours.
We didn't get anything. We shot about once in a while.
Of course it's a little bit scary when you have to win two or three balls.
The second half has been much better, we've been able to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push the opponents more often into such positions.
Is there a problem with a large number of changes in the composition?
Of course it's one of the diseases when a new man is formed.
We've only played three competitions and it's still changing.
It's about the trainer finding an ideal unit that's sitting.
Is it an incentive for you to play some of the two after you?
They're still just part of the escape.
I don't know how my condition will develop and when I can play it finally from the start.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that happened in Sparta?
We must be, otherwise it won't work.
It's the same as injury.
If you don't believe it, you can't go back.
Sparta has decided something, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will get worse.
The fans came back in large numbers, but they went into the cracks.
What can you show them?
There was another wonderful visit, just like Bohemka.
I'm really sorry we can't make them happier by doing better.
Bring in something they'll come next.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Can the season be at least a blessing for the ligature?
While we're fighting ourselves, we're playing games, so it's not that good for us.
In the case of an extreme tax deficit, the entrepreneur has to sit for ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the difficulty of the undertaking of Jiří Tomán, who has to pay a significant amount of tax for ten years in prison.
The estimated damage is 645 million kroner.
Toman, in his distress, claimed that justice violated his fundamental law, the effective finding of justice in Zlin and Olomoci are quite imperfect.
However, the Constitutional Court noted the difficulty of finding the CTC from the Court's database.
The U.S. is no longer a court of appeal.
"It is not possible as a fourth court to consider effective or legal doubts which may have been admitted by the General Court if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," they say.
Toman was sentenced as a fugitive.
The Verdikt is valid since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomoca.
At that time, Toman was in the issuing relationship in Argentina where, according to the introduction, he was found during the U.S. decision.
The penalty imposed is on the upper limit of legal fees which, according to the value, amounts to damage caused.
The Court of First Instance noted the extreme tax deficit which has a macro-economic impact on the state budget.
He acted as president of the World Service company from 2005 to 2008.
The damage of 645 million korunas occurred only during the period from January to July 2008, which according to the scientist has exceeded the billion.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Tomman for the entire amount.
According to the complainant, the World Service did not include all the invoices in its tax recognition.
Instead of monthly DPHs and consumption tax in at least 10 million korunas, tax was paid in statistics only.
The World Service and some companies with which the company has traded have a relationship with the company of the Council of Elections, which has rightly measured the machine with DPH in business with fine weights of 13 years of imprisonment.
He also refused his trial before the Constitutional Court.
The "Flight to Injury" and "Comrade Detective" series are playing on nostalgic site
This story is nostalgic as it was for the buildings of the famous 1980s; so for the '90s (when the geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the "The State" comedy box); and of course also for the modern age, in particular in 2001, before the stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poeheror and Paul Rudd started out with larger projects.
As an cultural artifact it is easy to parody and also to heal our modern Facebook eras of lasting memories.
From a French point of view, it looks like someone's breathing.
The "First Day of Camp" series worked marvelously well - not only thanks to absurd humor (for example, it can be a story of the origin of talking to green man named H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors abstained from the main funny points - middle-aged heroes who play adult children - and couldn't be drawn from previous events.
The continuation of “Ten Years Later” in which adults play as many adults as possible on an emotional level and satira is places until it is a family, including parody on a 90-year-old thriller as “Ruck on a bike”.
At one time the position is found at the Apple Powerbook Harbard Group, the pickles and the "out of other things since 1991".
Many of the main history lines are repeated.
Well-being Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, has not gone through his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still panicking.
It's not about the crazy stuff that includes Ronald Reagana (also Mr. Showalter), by George H. W. Bush (very well-contained Michael Ian Black).
As always are the best parts of French many later stories.
It's particularly fun to watch young Rudda with long hair allias is Matt Dillon from the movie Mádí, whose respect for Andy's position is now behind the old paper.
France could start the moments of appropriate madness, such as the Seven Up series, until it fails to achieve what I think will be a logical solution: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when the entire group finally appears on the "Flight to Inferno".
"Comrade Detective" in the Amazon calls for another type of nostalgia: revivalism studied in the series "So Normal Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde: No Mercy" and even the series "GLOW" where icons are displayed in the east and west resurrection scenes.
The comedy of Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka in the Rhyse Thomas regime is acting as a television show: a drama of two beautiful Romanian police officers who fought for truth and atheism in the way of Marxism-Lenism.
The main role - the famous Gregor and idealistic Joseph - plays Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Street, which contributed to the English language Channing Tatum (executive serial producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
I'm sorry, but it's not too much.
In some jokes you laugh (such as police watching chess on television - parody on American football).
The series won its voice by many famous heroes - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali and Chloe Svigny.
"Comrade Detective" is too focused on non-smoker propaganda drama - which includes killing with Reagan's mask - and it also seems.
Six long episodes are too exciting and comedy moments not enough.
At a shorter pace, a propaganda satir at the "Comrade Detective" could work, for example, in a scene where Gregor and Josef repeatedly visit the U.S. Velvyslannett, in which at least two of them hit the hamburgers assembled at a large assembly.
The clear message for an imaginary communist promise is that Western culture can change everything into a fence and an orgy.
The Romanian thinkers did not fail: we do so with our own culture, just as they do.
The Russian athletes didn't expect to break the IAAF start-up ban.
The IAAF International Athletic Federation at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on the launch of Russian athletes for a State-supported Diplomatic Programme.
The vote in the event of the World Championship, which begins on Friday, was expected to be very uniform.
For the extension of the ban, 166 delegates were spoken against only 21 votes in favour.
The main reason for refusal is the fact that Russia cannot meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as noted by the Chief of the IAAF Rune Andersen Special Investigation Group before the convention.
His group recommended that the order continue.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been heard and trainers are still working in the country.
It is not fully functional yet, nor is the Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Nevertheless, RUSADA can carry out tests under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"And when it comes to progress, there is still much work to be done," IAAF President Sebastian Coe said.
The Russian athletic Federation was suspended in November 2015, so the Russian athletes came apart from the Lonian Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban of the incoming MS, 19 Russians who had already demonstrated that longer periods were tested outside the Russian anti-doping system.
But they won't be able to start in national colors and if they win, they won't win a Russian hum.
The Bank of England supports the rate of 0,25 %
The Bank of England is expected to notify that the rate rate remains unchanged following an unprecedented economic growth and declining inflation which has contributed to speculation on rapid growth.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to "back" in relation to maintaining the rate - despite the growth of family budgets.
The policy makers of the Exchange Policy Committee (MPC) The Banks of England voted six to two times to keep the rate rate at 0,25 %. The results of the vote in order to increase the rate rate supported by a slight increase in economic growth.
In its annual report on the Bank’s inflation, it announced an increase of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and ensured that family budget reductions would continue. The Bank expects inflation to increase by up to 3%.
The Bank also noted that over the next few years there should be growth due to inflation caused by Brexit and also pointed out that the rental of mobility should be more than expected in financial markets.
The members of the committee also voted in favour of downloading part of the mother-in-law package, which was intended to support the economy, which was introduced into practice a year ago as a response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, it should start to pay from the next quarter the Terminated Financing Plan which offers a free contribution to banks, although the Bank of England has indicated that the planned EUR 115 billion will now be offered at $15 billion less.
Just before the bank's decision, the Bank stated: "The MPC predicts that the gross domestic product (HDP) will be combined from a short-term perspective with pressure on real household income and consumer burden."
The bank's rate indicated that there would be a need to "retain money policy gaps" to slow down inflation, which is "in a higher way" than the markets expected.
The markets are currently predicting the first growth in the third quarter of the next year and further growth in 2020.
However, the Bank pointed out that any increase would be "acceptable" and "limited".
The Bank has reduced the forecast growth rate for the year and the next year compared with 1.9% and 1.7% expected in May.
The projected growth in 2018 remained unchanged at 1,8 %.
After publication of the estimates, it will close the book against the dollar and the euro.
The amount shall be 0,5 % at $1,31 % and 0,4 % at EUR 1,11.
The decision to maintain the current state was followed by a sudden increase in hopes of further growth - GDP stood at 0.3% in the second quarter of 0.2% of the previous three months.
Despite the high probability, 0,3 % will remain in the third quarter, although it should be gradually increased by the end of the year, according to the bank's statement.
The latest inflation report is an unsatisfied shelter for households with inflation rising and a massive increase in payments. The Bank noted that the situation is getting worse before growth.
The report further states that monetary policy "cannot prevent" income reductions in the coming years, but it is expected that they will be "expected" at the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow thanks to the great interest in British goods due to the lack of libre, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer expenditure.
This Decision came in the year following last year’s fall in July of 0.025 % in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, resulting in a fall in the library.
The Bank estimates that full price and economy mergers will take at least four years.
Before the bank's decision on the latest rates, many called for an increase in the rate of inflation together, which increased the growing pressure on households, and three political factors called for an increase of 0.5% in June.
Inflation last month returned to 2.6 % of the red 2,9 %, although the bank indicated that such a change was expected and that inflation should take place again during the next month.
The Bank stated that the overrun of the 2 % target was "total" due to the lack of librarians.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “In view of the recent fall in swap rates, it seems that competition on the mortgage market will only take place once the creditors begin to oppose orders with a view to the end of the year.
The market seems particularly good to those who end existing contracts and repeated mortgages - in the offer there are options for free of charge, as well as the low rates they get on the job."
NHS prescribes HIV Contraversal Treatment 10 000 patients
Patients are given early access to ‘transformative’ treatment to HIV prevention based on a decision of the highest court on NHS funding.
The National Health Service (NSH) announced that the pre-exposure propylaxis (PREP) pre-exposure pill, which is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients up to 86 per cent, will be offered through health services in approximately 10,000 patients during the three-year trial period.
The NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the appeal court supported the decision of the highest court in the long term, stating that NHS had financial resources to compensate PrEP despite the declaration that the medicine should be funded by local authorities.
The decision announced on Thursday was taken by NHS Angli from the mouth of General Director Simon Stevens as "recognitional intervention", while National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as "the decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to receive patients. Other clinics will join in October and will come to full implementation throughout England by the end of 2018.
Pre-exposure propylaxis (PREP) is an HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Tests showed that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among threatened patients.
The use of PrEP before sex means that there are sufficient amounts of specific medicines in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Tested patients include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and people with HIV positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics shall identify capable participants who shall sign consent with participation in testing, including men, women, transsexual people and partners with whom HIV status has not yet been controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered in GP in Great Britain can also be enrolled in their local sexual health clinic and have a potential participation in testing.
The program will come to tax taxpayers for 10 million £ and NHS England signed a contract this week for the distribution of medicines after receiving an international public order.
The test period is designed to gather clinical evidence and to assess the full potential of PrEP, its target, its use and implementation in large measure.
Simon Stevens added: ‘This important intervention should be complemented and fully spent on growing and more successful HIV prevention efforts.
It's another lover in over thirty years trying to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health."
Deborah Gold, executive director of NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: ‘We are witnesses of the decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered properly and in patients at risk, the possibility of changing the HIV epidemic may be offered.
NSH is available from a range of patients at high risk of HIV infection, a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and independent of the need to discuss with a partner, leading to improved quality of life for many lives.
We accept this declaration with joy."
Ian Green, Executive Director Terrence Higgins Trust said: ‘The primary number one must be rapid testing across the country; we must ensure its availability for each patient.
We now have the test drug PrEP and we are on a good way to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of contracting HIV.'
Sharon Hodgson said: ‘The start of the test period PrEP is welcome and long-term change is expected after months of expenditure and maintenance by the government.
The evidence indicates how transformative this medicine can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and the elimination of this life-threatening infection.
The next tests will bring us closer to the full understanding of the PrEP benefits.
Now it is important for us to start testing as soon as possible throughout the country and protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and thus together end the spread of HIV in society."
Life on high feet: the interspecies and smart design changed this small apartment to Earls Court in a spacious house
Joanne Leigh, a former real estate banker, changed a large house in 2014 at Knightsbridge to live in Earls Court.
It is located in the first floor of the wise terrace Queen Anne - and is an observational demonstration of modern design, which uses the maximum available space.
"I used to live with my ex-wife in a much larger house in the fourth Knightsbridge," Joanne said.
“I looked for something at a reasonable price.
I grew up in this apartment in Earls Court and had the same height.
And I fell in love with him, and I fell on him the same day."
Since then, it has been home to the size of 1,000 meters of four complete renovation.
One-room apartment with a complex separation - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add the lighting space and the interspatial room to use a high ceiling.
“I used a high ceiling, large windows and a lot of light.
These were my requirements," she said.
To this end Erfan Azadi worked in the Duke & Shed's design and design studio with a seat in Notting Hill and used almost four-foot roof to create houses that were not only a project but also a place for life.
The step did not reach such heights that two mestres entered over it - the challenge for architects so it was to create a bridge that could go directly.
Erfan had to start his creative thinking.
"The structure of the object is quite complex," he explained.
"We both had to arrange space so that we could walk straight.
It wasn't just to set up a simple platform, but at the same time to fire the steel structure so that it's right above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to build two fully-fledged rooms on one another - and at the same time add to the drama.
In the meantime, it follows the beautiful living room of the old median frame in the design of Retrouvius.
The silverware furniture in the gold color, silver line and retro lustre Serge Mouille creates unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in dramaticity, space and lighting.
A short walk is taken to look at both sides and looks so much longer.
The cardboard in the kitchen looks like a window into other rooms.
In the entry door, storage spaces shall be located on the roofs of the containers and valves.
The exit of the living room, which provides the whole apartment with an enormous amount of space, is possible to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
The culinary kitchens aren't anything new.
What is unique to this solution, however, are the closing door.
"We had to solve the technical page," Erfan says about the sealed doors.
"The door is designed to prevent it very easily."
By using space and storage space, Joanne gained another 16 metres of square, second room and better overall separation of the apartment.
“When it comes to this, what you sell is the usual area – or the valuation of your property,” Erfan said.
"The real mackerel shall basically calculate its price on the basis of the living space when it enters the apartment."
In this case it was possible to raise the living space by maintaining the quality materials that provide space with a luxurious view.
"The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional touch with the home," Erfan added.
“You don’t like power generation in walls.
Yes, they're important, but your hearts don't get it."
As has been shown, quality design and expansion of the living area can change the usual apartment to an exceptional job.
And just like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is breaking up.
The cultural and political breakdown between the states of blue and red is deepening.
California has issued a ban on the travel of its citizens to the state of Tennessee and the other seven states.
The state of Tennessee paid for it and issued a legal ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, there is no prohibition in full terms that citizens of the United States can travel freely after all of the 15 states.
It is said that California has ordered state money on its citizens' way to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this crazy thing?
California is strong for LGBT and any evidence of non-compliance with the LGBT lifestyle is considered discrimination.
Tennessee, however, adopted a law on the benefit of a conscience that states that psychotherapy, which has a moral problem with LGBT treatment in the community, has no obligation to provide it, but it has a duty for these patients to ensure another treatment that has no such problem.
Texas and other states have also adopted laws under which the religious charitable organizations that have received children after birth to adoption do not have the responsibility of these children to provide the same couples with adoption.
As a result of these laws on the benefit of California's conscience, it prohibited the financing of its citizens' journey to eight states of the Union from its means.
In practice, it means that California professors should not have access to scientific symposia, for example, in Texas paid from their universities because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example to Tennessee with financial support from their schools.
On the way, they have to get either federal grants, but it's absurd that the federal government finance the roads of citizens from state A to state B, or private sponsoring.
The state of Tennessee has come to be patient and its parliament has adopted a law by which it also does not like the California policy of high taxes, high government expenditure, high deficits and the tolerance of illegal immigrants, but it still does not like California because of this travel embargo.
It is considered a guide for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
The same will happen to any Union State which would otherwise have ordered a similar ban on travel for any reason.
At the same time, he urged the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
The fact is, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, it's all constitutional, it's nothing anti-constitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on the reward of conscience, as well as to decide on what their money is going to be and what they should not.
Second, what's wrong with winning a conscience?
If he has a problem with selling eggs, why can't he just offer cows, pigs, chickens and fish?
Why should he be forced to sell grapes even under the punishment if the grape harvesters offer enough grapes?
In Colorado, one baker faces an anti-discrimination complaint and a high trial because he refused to commit torture on a homosexual wedding.
However, it also rejects five dorsts for Halloween or alcohol.
Why don't you bury him and leave him in the room and the appropriate dormitory? Don't order him in the hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can establish internal, domestic policy in non-federal powers, in accordance with their own preferences.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states too!
Fourthly, members of the LGBT communities at times correctly applied tolerance to their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community are guided by the rules of life and let everyone be guided by them, but some activists never encourage tolerance against themselves or others, despite extreme intolerance against others.
They say that no one should ever have any moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do so, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is total.
They're new-time enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I don't know the situation in American history when the states adopted such actions on political issues, except in the case of one case.
Even in times of civil rights hunting, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and Jih on the side of segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
This was the only case in the 50th century, the political cause was child prostitution, and the North War against Jihu.
Of course nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political breakdown between the states of moderate democratic and red republics is deepening and the United States is mentally disintegrating.
Unauthorized agitation.
Critic Putin's got a massive shock.
The Russian opposition policy Alexei Navalnyj received 300 thousand rubles to break the rules of the campaign before presidential elections, which will take place next year.
The court accused him of calling people to participate in illegal demonstrations.
In almost two months, he organized two major anti-government protests and announced that in March the next year, he wanted to be appointed as head of state.
The executive director of Kremulu Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidate, but is generally expected to do so and win it again.
Suddenly he said the police came to him in the morning and brought him to court.
He's been accused of calling people to show videos on YouTube.
It's three hundred thousand.
"Later we're pulling them off the judge's pay," he tweeted on Kremla's Twitter critic.
The Russian Electoral Commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in presidential elections because he had previously been proved to be disappointed.
The general who is considered a fighter against corruption, however, is politically motivated by the relevant judgment.
Over 300 thousand rubles, 25 thousand rubles were also placed on Thursday by two members of the Naval Pre-Trial Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
He rarely entered the Russian policy as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became dominant personalities on the disputed opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to protect the Navalne in the campaign as much as possible.
In fact, he was sentenced to a five-year sentence because he had stolen the wooden company Kirovles.
In May, the jury confirmed the appeal.
The decision is so legitimate that it prevents the ordinary from applying for a candidate under Russian law.
Brothers fight for the empire at a value of over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after their Italian family’s empire was founded, over one of the most expensive Victorian properties in value exceeding $500 million.
Former director Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis live in Toorak, just three rooms from his younger brother Paula, who fought for joint property and business names to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave a family business already in 2014, but a sharp dispute was still being brought before the Supreme Court.
Together with his mother, Anna's own brothers totally 38 properties in value of more than half a billion dollars. The first trade bought the family in 1973 at Smith Street in Collingwood.
This place was founded by the Westco Jeans family, which grew into a network of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the whole company sold for $85 million.
Other properties and portfolios of De Lutis now include offices, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrent, apartments on Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers on the property.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who is according to Paul's words "a significant source of power and dominant personality" of De Lutis's family, owns only two-thirds of its assets.
The court records say Colin owns property at $316 million, while Paul repairs property at $176 million.
For Paul the problem was the distribution of property and financial resources.
"Colin's proposal was expressed in my eyes with great benefit," Paul wrote in a local court statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed peace attempts, the first sitting of the Supreme Court began.
The brothers are now also opposed to who will control the existing business - from which Paul said Colin has resigned.
Colin argues that this is not true and accuses Paul of mismanagement of certain properties.
In the previous local declaration Colin stated that he believed in a lasting solution to the conflict.
"My Italian origin tells me that the family is the most important thing," he wrote.
The costs of the court are incurred. The hundreds of local declarations, e-mails and messages from the company, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, are charged by lawyers, including Allana Myerse, QC and both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her married husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who had been working in the milk bars and toilets since the 1950s and in the 1970s they bought a farm in Brunswick.
They bought property for money obtained from the property installation in Collingwood, where Colin opened up the first family company with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in the last high school year, Paul was a young, about 10-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutis explained that, along with Luigi who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to their children would go well.
"Lugi often said that he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group. Colin stated that Mark was injured at his departure by $10 million and Luke by $26 million.
As Paul, Luke and Mark pointed out, “they were not satisfied with the conditions of their financial injury”.
Colin has since been back, despite the fact that he was an ex-constitutional member of the AFL club, as stated in his 2015 autobiography, Eddie McGuire knows the television personality and Colina's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colina and Paula de Lutisov and their lawyers on Friday.
He only answered Colin by means of a text message in which he stated that, given the fact that the dispute was resolved before the court, "I have nothing to add".
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to resolve the whole matter before the court," he wrote.
In half of 2016, in one of the court statements Colin stated that he was trying to adapt to his brother's needs.
"Our father would be very upset if he saw our current situation," he listened and added that "he is still hoping for a solution."
On Friday, all hopes were inconceivable.
"Our disputes will be resolved in a quick time of trial," Colin wrote.
The wind in the Czech Republic.
Teachers blow up children.
MHD drivers love water and summer clothes.
At the Mother's School At Chodovci in Prague 4, where about 35 children are now arriving, she's only leaving tomorrow.
The school is after reconstruction and extended trees are not yet providing a large wall.
There's no pool there, but the children's teachers go to the bathroom.
In the afternoon children stay in classes where they are loaded with iron and heavy loads.
The air is trying to ease the clean air because there are no air conditioning.
It's an order for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature inside and outside exceeds the hygiene limits for maternal schools, so we should not even have an open operation during this period," said school director Miloslav Makovic.
In school there's a clear corridor where the temperature moves around 40 degrees.
We'll blow up in the morning at 6 p.m. and close the window and have the south sides of the iron that we're protecting.
"But it can't help much," she added.
Better conditions are in the forest school At the Games in Hosticides, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We've got trees growing on the ground, so we're under them.
"We've got a beautiful solution there, there's a table under it, and there we're doing different things," said the school director Barbara Company.
Teachers and children try to walk into the forest where there is more ice.
Children have wet chips and have different water games on the program.
"We have a handcuffer that is used for flowering, and we use it for raising children," said Kompano.
Also, the head of the mother school in the streets of Novoborká on the Prague Prosequek Jitka Vilimovská said that teachers try to keep children in the stage and bodies are water.
"We have a relatively growing garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
It's going out in the morning and then until 15 o'clock.
Every child must have a head covering.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, some low-fat tea or regular juice and have a drink on the garden with water.
Each day they also have vegetables to eat, and every day they always have pure fruits and vegetables that their parents bring to them.
"Maybe a mother here today brought about ten-year-old meloun for the children," Makovic added.
Drivers get water or the same year.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with hot days of water, ion drinks or summers.
Drivers' cabins are also tramping buses in most cases air-conditioned, Dr. DPP Aneta řehkov .
In addition to the cabin, some trams are air-conditioned in the travel area.
Trawl wheels of high temperatures have not yet been seriously damaged.
A minor injury occurred in the village of Hostivar.
At the current high temperatures, we are particularly concerned with having drivers available enough drinking.
"The closed drinking water is available in all the drawings, cutting points and driving points," Réeková said.
In trains and in some places, employees have a sodobar that manufactures a glass of soda.
Drivers are also getting loosely protected ion drinks.
"They can also use the annual uniform which increases drivers' approval in their daily changes," added the speaker.
The hot and dry weather in the last days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
In the afternoon they were liquidated throughout the Czech Republic 108, thus double the long-term daily average.
On the next day, when temperatures in Česka jumped over 35 degrees Fahrenheit [35 ° C], the fire fighters were mainly engaged in firefighting.
"They dominate fires in the natural environment as well as those that are connected with iron work," said the speaker Nicole Zaaral.
Not even the evening change was made when the heat on a series of seats bursted with noises and civil strife.
In connection with the storms, the pilots were able to reach 236 principles.
It was particularly about the removal of fallen trees and plants.
"Most of them were busy in the Middle East," Zaaral continues.
But the help of the firemen was also needed in the Stvolinkas in Českolipska, where 60 people from the children's camp were evacuated to safety because of the storm.
Tropical temperatures also assigned work to Persian rescuers.
In the afternoon and in the middle of the night, we ate the sandwiches to ten cases of the deserting of the oxidized with a punishment.
That's why people should let their heating water check, protect the rescuers.

The new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the president's media diet
Many people tried it before him, and they always laughed.
Maybe John F. Kelly really does.
If you do, it'll be the first.
Portal Politico stated that the new head of the White House plans to limit the information provided by President Trumpa - including reports in television news - in order to keep the Trumpa cold.
Here is part of the report by the rapporteur, Josh Dawseye:
"When the new Head of the White House John F. Kelly arrived on the first day of his new job with employees, there was a key problem with the White House's Trump who is willing to make: incorrect information that gets the president into his hand.
Kelly told employees that he must personally accept all information - whether it's paper or speech - because the President can make a better decision on the basis of the right information."
Kelly's diagnosis really makes sense, but many of his predecessors were on the control of the trumpet and his presentation in the media.
Trup's media relationship dates several decades back - and now that he sits in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump as a candidate has been broken up by honest reports, it would be appropriate for him to show that in a positive light he is talking about a lot of other media that would be easier to convince," stated the former campaign advisor for Politico Sam Nunberg.
Tara Palmer, from Politico's portal, wrote that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets on the back - at least according to the words of the six former organizers of his campaign - is to ensure that Trump regularly monitors the media on which he is praised."
Okay.
However, the idea that Trump’s tendency to publish his views on Twitter was once “under control” is ridiculous.
Maybe these organizers of the campaign know something that the rest of them don't know - that Trump's tweets would be more confusing if someone didn't control them.
We'll never know about the tweets that Trump never sent.
If his employees were able to hold him back at least several times, then their efforts did not go away.
However, no one has ever been able to regularly prevent Trump from raising controversial issues.
Part of this problem lies in the fact that in the White House, which is composed of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by putting together materials - which they can but must not be reliable - which support their view of the world.
The Portal Politico, which covered the problem from all sides, published in May a report on the appointment of consultants to present suspicious information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from Shane Goldmacher's peer reporter:
"The contemporary and former officials of the Trupa say that the President sometimes reacts very clearly to negative media reports, in particular reports on information exclusion, and seeks to find their origin.
This situation came to an end when someone supported the president's copy of the article from GotNews.com - the Web site of Prof. Charles C. Johnson - who accused the representative of Chief of Katie Walsh of being "a source of a lot of information" from the White House.
No matter how Johnson was always exposed to Twitter for harassment; or that he did not submit his claim to any evidence; or that he had already published false charges in the past and later rejected them.
The trumpet read the article and started asking Walsh."
Goldmaker added that the former director of Reince Priebus and the secretary of the White House Rob Porter "have tried to implement the system for the management and documentation of information received by President Trump".
Would that work?
Kelly's been trying to launch the same strategy three months later.
It may be shown that he is more effective than Priebus, but his impulse will not go away that way, and his assistants will continue to oppose him.
These constant factors of Kelly's mission will certainly be very difficult.
Tourists agree on the approach and return to the "Millions Square"
Several of the most popular owners of the house in the English province of West Midland will again travel to the front of the selected tourists who join the local authorities on the right to re-evict the field behind their seats.
Tourists parked 20 caravans on the ground at the beautiful street in Solihull, which is seen as a 'millionaire quarter'.
By bringing horses, children and caravans, tourists return after what they were shown in May. They did not miss an opportunity that had been purchased on site on the basis of a regulation aimed at preventing their fall.
The tactical team found mermaids in the army and crossed into the field with the caravan unprotected mermaid who served on the road.
The residents of the four districts attacked the City Council of Solihull by ‘not able to solve a problem’.
One of the residents who wanted to stay in anonymity said: ‘ They took this place on the afternoon after they had moved to the Bentley Heath street, where they were building stones for the rest of the people.
The Governing Council should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they're back.
Last night they came next and they'll probably come even more today.'
She added: ‘The Birmingham Legal Council knows how to deal with this problem. It uses court orders to protect parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and I don't want to continue to build taxes until the tourist board is arranged."
Another of the anonymous citizens said: ‘It’s funny. We have just been following the latest tourists and now they’re back.
And this time there's more of them and this time they brought horses with them."
The Press Speaker of the City of Solihull said: ‘We are aware of the illegal residence on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and in cooperation with local police we are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the whole problem.
In order to gather as many evidence as possible, it is necessary for local citizens to report any uncooperative or anti-political behaviour on number 101.
We're going to get the whole picture we're going to give to the court."
The European Parliament's husband hit a car in Brussels.
He was brought by a government specialty.

The Italians agree to fight the saved NGO ship with immigrants on deck
Italy announced that it would limit the entry of saved NGOs to the border of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean if NGOs did not sign new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," said interior minister Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin Daily La Stampa.
The day of warning came after the Italian authorities had enjoyed the ship of the German rescue organisation Jugend Retett because of suspicion of trafficking in human beings, which significantly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organisation, which works for the first year, refused to comment on the whole thing because of the charge by Italian State applicant Ambrogia Cartíe.
"It is for us and will always be a priority for the number one saved human lives. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the areas of survival at the same time," the organization said in a statement on social networks.
"We can only comment on all the current charges after collecting all the information and assessing the whole situation."
The Italian authorities have been following the Iuventa ship of the Jugend Retett since October.
Her crew is suspected of carrying immigrants on board, who were handed over directly to people, and repeatedly.
At least one meeting was reported by the complainant only 1.3 miles from the border of Libya. The meeting was published by the Italian media.
The board of ships is suspected of violating the law and entering the Italian coast guard, which is responsible for rescue operations in this area - from humanitarian control, more than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board the ship, such as Yuventa for monitoring activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organizations that participate in rescue operations have already agreed with the maintenance of the code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last-mentioned organisation stated on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable because they do not present any ‘substantial change or obstacle’ relating to saved operations.
For example, the adoption of the new Code of Conduct has been rejected by the Free Medical Organisation (MSF), which is the holder of the Nobel Prize.
In the meantime, it has been concluded that the sudden decline of immigrants in the last few weeks that are emerging in Italy during rescue operations indicates that efforts to strengthen the sights on the Libya border and to work with local people bring fruit.
"In the last days we are starting to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
It has also identified plans for further meetings to be carried out this month with regard to Libya's old-fashioned economic development initiatives, as well as the representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali with regard to measures to reduce the number of migrants left behind by those countries in hopes of achieving Europe.
Unsatisfied Mesaroša: The silica and cellulitis were released from her upper arm!
The hot summer days are full of love for taking on themselves only the most necessary thing to hide these most intimate parties.
Only Dominica Mesarosh does it.
At the afternoon meeting in the Prague zone, where it's herries, modulators, singers and all they have to do with TV Prima, she just cheated her body into mini space.
And there were only a few regular movements and the model showed its silicones to everyone, but also thanks.
He overruled her several times between half and half, and he showed her so high that she had to keep it up.
The attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present was absolutely unnecessary.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to send text messages leading to the suicide of Conrad Roye
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for committing suicide by means of text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter lives 15 months from a double-year prison in the network and then spends five years in a conditional release.
Carter was sentenced in June to an unintentional murder of Conrad Roye, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Roy’s father told the court on Thursday: “The whole family is exhausted.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until the decision was made.
She was threatened with 20 years of freedom, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy were suffering from mental illness.
Dressed in red shirts and cream flowers, Carter stood on the ground with tears in his eyes, his hands and his eyes leading to the ground.
" Her horse killed Conrad Roye," the judge complained.
"Finished his life so you could take it yourself.
She couldn't accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She didn't have any exercises."
However, Carter’s legal representative said that it was “an unhappy situation which he is impatiently sorry for".
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "their age or degree of maturity or even mental disorder have no significant impact on her behavior".
Sadly, Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy, read: “It won’t take a day for me to stop worrying about my son’s loss.
I want him to be proud of me - I hope he's his sister and we'll suffer the incalculable pain that we'll carry with us forever," continued the statement.
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy has proved that she's "following" her by knowing that she's never going to get involved with her brother's wedding and will never be his child's aunt.
"The loss of the person I've seen since I was born is the pain I will bring to life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would set up a person helping to kill another person.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 on the seat of a car.
The case drew attention to the entire nation after Carter’s text messages were published, which led to suicide.
"Maybe you jump out of the building or get out of it, I don't care," wrote Carter in the text messages that he sent just two weeks before his death when Roy was allowed to family.
A few minutes before he was killed, she wrote to him, "You have to do this to Conrade" and "It's enough to punish the generator and be free and happy."
Judge Moniz stated that Carter was carefully investigating Roy's death and ordered that any comments be held in the press.
For example, he raised a number of questions.
One of the people who stood on Carter's side was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to death by her British counterpart in Italy in 2007. Two years ago the charge was released.
Ms. Knox (30) published a statement in Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not imprisonment."
Audi manages up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to severe withdrawal
A long day before the announcement of the Audi car manufacturer BMW announced that it will offer its customers an update of the software in more than 350 000 vehicles.
The president of BMW said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Mnichova, which is a resident of BMW - which consider the ban or restrictions on diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will manage three million Mercedes vehicles throughout Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies referred to this decision as landing.
European car manufacturers have promoted a great deal of use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States in order to comply with the Regulation on CO2 emissions.
However, oxygen of the soul released by diesel engines is considered carcinogen and may cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of the vehicle is increased to install a device to neutralise gas emissions from diesel engines, which facilitates the competitiveness of cars.
While German car manufacturers face keen visits, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of breaking up powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The company is trying to avoid errors in Volkswagen which in an attempt to meet the emission limits has installed software into its vehicles which has reduced the amount of emissions issued during testing, but under normal conditions the software has been disabled.
Several senior representatives of Volkswagen were charged in the United States and the others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former leading thermodynamics of the engine development department in Audi would be arrested in Germany.
The former manager of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian national and does not rely on him for extradition, so he can face the trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi initiated a criminal investigation by the German police in the matter of Volkswagen's car after the authorities charged Audi with installing a system that was to address European emission limits - and extended the charge that Audi is leading in the United States.
The inclusion of the Audi car in the investigation may have a negative impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer creates an insignificant part of Volkswagen's profit.
The plane suddenly landed on the beach.
A man and a girl are missing.
The accident occurred on the beach of Praia de São João in Costa da Caparica, 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses to the SIC Noticias TV channel said that the plane was flying closely over the people on the beach before landing.
Some of the people from the beach probably escaped from danger to the sea.
Two people complained before the machine didn't escape.
On the beach, according to local media, a 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died.
"The plane broke down and they were dead on site," said local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not known yet.
On the deck of the plane there were two people, both of whom were taken alive from the accident, and the police took them to the airport.
D11 or don't set the distance.
And the distances in the Czech Republic are even perfect?
I'll give you a hug.
It's not available, even though it started to be put in 1978.
Even if it's not available, it's still being repaired.
And he can't keep doing this even if he has a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, the edge of the D11.
The construction of her next mission at least for several months has again stopped the pursuit of the Children of the Earth.
We're getting out of here on the coast like they're picking up salt.
They turn around and they'll see when and if we even get another one.
We don't want anything weird right now.
We just want a short drive and we want to get trucks coming to Poland or from Poland from the village and town.
Infinite trucks go directly through the city of Jaromer or Nachod, which is not like a reasonable object.
Just so far, the last cut of our declared distance was made in 2008, so nine years ago.
From that time on, there's no kiss.
So when the remaining four-kilometre journey to the King's Palace was recently started with an archaeological study that started at the end of this year, you could hear the sound of the explosions in the eastern Czech Republic.
No one's ever believed in it.
Last week it was shown that this year is not going to happen.
And maybe next year.
The arrest of the Children of Land Club for sustainable transport from Brna has yet to come to a halt.
Children in the country repeat their D1 tactic.
They attacked decisions on construction permits throughout the country.
They shall request a review of all the mandatory positions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the garden master, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Office of the Treasurer.
So far from D11, we're going to the village with the name of the Dead Sea.
So we're going down, we're just going along the road, and we're standing right next to the road, and we're giving priority to our next assignment to the column.
The worst thing is that you see similar stories throughout the Republic.
Dhissive, still on the road to Benesev, D1 or D8.
Everyone's got their dead body.
What do the Children of Earth need?
What is the basis of the problems of the communication building in Czech Republic?
And why is a remote network practically impossible in the current system?

Levandule from Provence threatens climate change
Levandules became a symbol of Provence in the south-eastern France, but now they are threatened with climate change.
Levanduli is affected by dry weather and harmful germs, which causes fear in the faces of researchers and farmers seeking solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, stated: “The production of lead in Provence is at risk because over the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change that brings less stress on both sides and on the ground.
It affects the life of the lifter.
They also have interest in it, and they carry micro-bacterials that are given in dry weather."
There's a lot in the bag.
Levandule is an important ingredient of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “The place of long and beautiful flowers is less, undiminished and often weak plants.
The amount of oil obtained from these lamps is significantly smaller."
The possible solution can be more effective distribution of water and reduction of water from the soil, but also the flow of lead to a protective mixture of food and water and a reduction of several types of soil against dry weather.
The press's campaign highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the week of Riodoce regularly meet every Wednesday to discuss news about the disturbances that are taking place in the area of Sinaloa for organised crime, corrupt officials and non-exploited drug wars.
Today, however, recent events are largely due to their own security.
They find it important to change their habits.
Two deserve reporters are talking about what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office where someone hit a grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote on the black table three simple words: opponents, neutrals and allies.
Journalists ask that every word be given names - there is no need for any evidence, enough to use the presentation and presentation.
Selecting them - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose purpose is to hide criminal proceedings.
Violence does not stop and the body goes to mass throughout the country; journalists remain among them: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 of them are killed by President Enrique Pena Nieta in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and in all seven states, they have been killed this year.
Among them are the co-founder of the Riodioce newspaper, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence dealing with drug trafficking.
His loss is interesting, although his presence is all-professional - a large photo of Valdez with the title “Justice”, on which the middleman points out, depends on the cover of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a trick with Valdez's photo with smile on his face, glasses on his nose and cheeks Panama.
The meeting will take place about two months after his death; journalists will talk about each other’s traumas, nightmares, sleeplessness and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was set up to resolve the case of journalists in 2010, two suspects were still complaining, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur each year are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime.
Journalists from Riodoce insist that they will be informed of the violence that is taking place in Sinaloa; although they are unfortunately destroyed and the land in question is currently very fragile.
Without information about the killings and without a view of justice, the meeting on security is an immediate one, says Ibarra.
"It is a shame to spend time at such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, we won't trust anyone."
On May 15th, Valdez left the center of Riodoce in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloy.
He was given a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him by 12 shots, according to all the name of the article - which can be translated as the 12th river.
Then the shooters got into his car and ran away from where they were doing it.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left his wife and two grown children behind.
It seems that in Culiacan, the voice is spreading fast.
In Valdez's case, however, there's a suspicious silence.
Sinaloa has been one of the most bloody battles in the country since Guzman's long imprisonment and his nuclear release into the United States, as the opposition group tries to fill an empty space.
Every day in the streets of Sinaloa, several people are killed, and burials are full of two-patriot mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Remember for a time that the word "medium" means that one drug cartel controls the coastal state with expensive ports and important routes leading to the United States of drugs.
Despite this, just as the fact that Valdez was known for his employment risks, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodace, continues to argue that he did not protect his friend.
He believes that two suspects have contributed to his death.
The first was the irony of the conversation with Damas Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels who led the war with the son of Joaquín Guzman.
Peace could have shattered the sons; suspect members of the gang had stolen all copies of the newspaper at the time they stood on the poles.
The other mistake was to stop Valdez from leaving the country because of his own security after having fun with other newspapers in which the same story was published.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and on his death he was regarded as an important milestone in the fight against Mexican crimes against journalists.
He was allowed to live so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that he would never change.
In the Noroest period, he was practically a veteran when he decided to sell his share at $50 in 2003 and set up with five Riodace colleagues.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run a newspaper and not mention drug trafficking," Bojorquez said.
In time, Riodoce received good news of state and true justice; the news began to be given.
Newspapers were happy to be sent to post problems and published texts without censorship - the reader fascinated the reading of stories that no one else had ever considered.
Eight years after it was founded, Riodoce won a prestigious evaluation of Maria Moors Cabot for a report on Latin America.
The same year Valdez won an evaluation of the International Press Freedom Committee for the Protection of Journalists for its state report on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted he was scared.
"I was afraid of my life," he said when he accepted the price.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "the way of life," Valdez said in October of the year in his talk for Rompevinto TV.
“You must take the role of the journalist – or play the fool.
I don't want anyone to ask me, 'What did you do to face death... why didn't you tell me what's going on?'
The Riodoce staff are after Valdez. A man was known for his ridicule and non-selective language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and advice - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his shoes.
He often went to El Guayabo bar against the office and sat at the same table.
Now they're asking: did this routine cause his death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job the best and stay alive?
"They don't like it when you pay for their wives, children, clean shops, secret parking lots."
"These things have been banned," Bojorquez said.
This leads to a high level of sebecensorship and self-sustainment.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel like he's not playing anything here, he's gone.
The problem is, editor Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "their meaning is that it can be misleading... and then it came to that thing with Javier."
He says that the old rules are no longer paid in Sinaloa - just like in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, which are home to the toxic mix of luxury pastries, weak governments and corrupt policies.
The country doesn't change.
In the rooms where Riodoce's employees are located, no mobile phones are allowed; a few days ago, there was also a spy that governments bought to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Before the building, two police officers found the floor before the 40th floor in the wall of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the offices of Riodoce, which are located in the four-storey building in the city district of Culiacan.
Journalists wonder if the same is not the 50 per cent of law defenders who are alleged to be corrupt by the government.
It's been a couple of months since journalists have recently emerged into the mining areas that are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week's program.
The first of these is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Cháveze in Sinaloe.
They are also subject to suspicious government expenditure incurred in the home city of the state governor.
Recently it also came to a number of entrances in one of Culiacan's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the state representative's office.
Officially, no one knew the identity of the people involved or the circumstances of the state, so the journalists were warned when they wanted to write about what everyone in town knows: that restaurant is a favorite destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists counted from public records that the restaurant was registered on behalf of a certain policy that is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has all levels of political scene almost all over the past century.
Several of the rulers of PRI have recently been accused of corruption on high positions.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about previous incidents that occurred in the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín's sons "El Chapo" Guzmán unique military unit.
More than a month ago, readers would read about this subject in the Valdez section, which was the best source of information on the union.
"Valdez would certainly have solved the case," said Villarreal (46), who is represented by "El Flaco" for his tight position.
"Now all the informers have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office has changed to the warehouse of cedillas and the appeal to protest against the killing of journalists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez broke down several weeks and appeared the following morning to demonstrate before the state representative's office because of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared only three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of Michocán.
The authorities claim that based on DNA analysis it is Adame.
Newspapers are active throughout the country. Many of them organize protests and watch on the walkers and buildings "SOS print".
Director of the Bojorquez newspaper is the day on the visit to Washington, where he seeks international support and to achieve justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloy, who took place the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the press and their killings of reporting the truth.
Meanwhile, she asked for a translation into another section of her concern that her anger could threaten her impartiality.
Valdez repeatedly stated that the Mexican journalists are "contained" by organised crime, corrupt officials and the host public.
In his last book Narco-Journalism, he wrote that journalists die not only by drug cartels but also by policy and security forces working with organised crime.
The media surveillance group of Article 19 accused more than half of all attacks on the police and public officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to silence you," Ramirez added.
They're obviously working.
No one remembers the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, who arrived six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found together with an inscription that probably signed the cartel Zetas: "This is how I ended up because of my message."
According to the broken heads, she was lying on the keyboard and listening.
Some parties decided to end their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper, with a seat at the northern border of Chihuahua in response to the sudden killing of reporter Miroslav Breacho.
The rest continue, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after his president's death in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez released a public drug cartel article entitled "What do you want from us"?
Some journalists jumped out of their homes or even across the border.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, just like getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly following you.
And the journalists were followed up and killed, for example, in the case of Ruben Espinos, who was murdered in 2015, along with four women living in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruze.
For those who have decided to stay and do not give up their work, it is a major risk every day.
Ibarra, who wanted to be one of those bastards, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, so I became a journalist," he said.
It is Friday night and the Riodoce staff sit on the walkway in front of the office - the latest issue is sent to the printer - drinking beer when they start calling.
It is found that 19 people died near the beach resort in the city of Mazatlán during the shooting between gang members and the police.
The flag shall be positioned just as many links left in this area by the trade union members.
Journalists publish this news from the mobile phone on Riodoc’s websites.
It won't take one day and the initial title will change again.
The sound of the police sirens indicates another explosion.
Bojorquez has a summer look at the police station to make sure they pay attention.
If they're scared, they don't give it up.
Under the huge portrait of the late co-founder of their period - whose mediator is an expressive figure for the whole Sinaloe - all Riodoce employees follow his steps.
"How can we just think about leaving," Bojorquez said, "when I was killed the same day when Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her to the street?"
The dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a soy sauce, no matter how scary.
Researchers have now discovered the conclusions of the first great creations of the size of the nostalgia, which the perfect preserved remains - which experts called "Mona Lisou dinosaurs" - found the Canadian horn.
The others were kept so high that experts were able to identify the red color of his skin his skin and indicated that dinosaurus had a ‘ problem history’.
The article in the journal Current Biology stated that it is one of the ‘most conservative yet found in the world’ of the most complex dinosaurs and one of the most diverse types of dinosaurs.
It is a species of beetle in the family Nodosouridae. Dinosaurus lived in the period Crídy, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly well - kept status was shocked by the researchers who described it as “an appreciable experience. ”
Turned whitesmith, according to National Geographic, is still the most popular stone mine of its kind.
The find is Shawn Funk, who dropped the stoneline on 21 March 2011 on his way down to Suncor Millenium near Canadian Alberty.
He found something that looked like a foreign subject and decided to look into it closer.
The monument was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the following six years working on the discovery of animals from the size of the country of 1100 kg.
After completion of work, dinosaurus is ready for release.
'It's enough to touch your eyes and believe you're asleep,' said Caleb Brown's manager and the naturalist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
‘It will certainly be recorded in history as one of the most beautiful and most impressive types of dinosaurs - Mona Lisa dinosaurs.’
A study of his skin revealed that this biologist - although covered by lightning and reminded of the moving tank - was likely to face a serious threat from massive dinosaurs.
The heavily converted dinosaur used a red and white compass to protect against predators and used a masking system that uses many animals today.
The experts claim that this enabled him to swim better with his environment and avoid his enemies. The masking system indicates that he was loved by the food of larger dinosaurs.
News of 110 million years of old dinosaur nodosauridae has been first published in the newspapers in May. At present it is available for observation at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers gave him the name Boreopelta marmitchelli after the technique of the Museum of Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the team in intensive fossil detection.
Thanks to the amazing experience of fossils, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document samples and forms of soap and covering throughout the body.
They discovered the masking method that today's animals use for weapons - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masculinity is common in nature, researchers are surprised because Borealopleta’s size is far too large for animals using the same technique today.
So it is possible that dinosaurus was such a number of predators that evolution gave the advantage of masking before confrontation.
Many present-day animals with mascots - such as deer, rabbits and birds - are much smaller and more vulnerable as a benefit, which means that noodaurus had to fight for his surviving text.
‘The transmission of a large and heavy dinosaura turned into a visual illustration of the risks posed by the rapporteurs during the course of the race,’ Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds contained in soups also revealed that the dinosaur skin probably had reddening.
Researchers continue to study animals and look for other knowledge of his life, including the contents of the stomach stored to feed his last meal.
He believes that after his death the dinosaur fell into the river and was taken to the sea where he fell down.
In the area of Alberty there was the same climate as in Florida today and the rivers and oceans have moved much further into the interior than it is today.
‘This nodosaurus is truly remarkable that it is fully covered in perfectly preserved skin and is also kept in three dimensions and we can thus see its original size,’ Brown said.
‘For these reasons, animals appear to be practically the same as during cattle.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; it's enough to touch your eyes a little bit and it seems like he's just asleep."
During the course of the course of the cycle, largepods passed through the earth, massive dinosaurs that moved on two legs.
Despite the king of all dinosaurs - Tyranosaurus rex - lived for several million years after the Borealopeltas, this reverse dinosaur could have been the beloved advantage of his equally terrible ancestors.
It belongs to them Acrocanthosaurus, 11,5 meters long monster with weight greater than 6 tons.
Researchers whose latest discovery was published in the journal Current Biology believe that the body of Borealoplet was excavated into the sea after being immigrated to the pool.
The find is Shawn Funk, who dismissed the stoneline on 21 March 2011 at the time of his return to Suncor Millenium near Canadian Alberty.
According to the museum, it is the most well-founded reverse dinosaur in the world, including skin and defense, which is more complete than the chains on the neck.
The animal reached a height of 5 metres and weighed up to 1300 kg.
He had two 50 cm bones made of copper.
Researchers believe that this archaeologist traversed the land of Canada today until he ended up in the river that sailed him to the sea.
His underwater grave kept his body in perfect condition.
Fossil residues of this type are also kept to the extent that the rounds around the lungs continue to cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “the discovery of such a sealed unit can be compared to the victory in the lottery.
The more I watch him, the more shocked I find it.
Fossil residues of this type are also kept to the extent that the rounds around the lungs continue to cover the remains of the skin.
On his side is his right front leg with his fingers pointing upward.
I can easily count the assholes on his walk.'
How did one activist find out the answer to the question ‘Who Streets?’
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrello died all over the body.
The day after she arrived in New York, St. Louis' parents set up a bed in Airbnb's room and made contributions to Facebook on their phone.
She also grew up to contribute to some high school jokes.
"The police just shot an 18-year-old boy whose body is still lying on the street," he continued.
She was surprised that no one else had written this contribution to her, so she closed her Facebook and opened her Twitter.
The user @TheePharoah constantly tweeted her contributions to the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis published on Twitter his contributions to the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old boy who shot a white cop in the city of Ferguson, Missouri.
He published Brown's photo of the body, which lies uncontrollable on the street, where no one took it in four hours.
"That's crazy," thought Ferrel.
Death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put her phone back to him the night she was watching the tweets about people who gathered at Canfield Drive.
One of the men said he was the victim's father and kept his cell phone with the letter "The Ferguson Police killed my unarmed son"!
She was following live reports - one of the police stood before a group of protesters, holding a guide and at the end of his shooting dog.
In another video, another policeman held his hand in his hand with the gun he pointed to and said: "I'll kill you all... animals."
"It's not normal," said Ferrel.
"This is not the kind of murder we've been accustomed to and we can call it normal.
I felt the hair of my skin all over my body.
"I was upset and crying."
She immediately spoke back and went home the other day.
After arriving at 23:00, she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided they were going out to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrello and the city of Ferguson during the next three years describes the new document “Whose Streets?”, which will be introduced into kin on 11 July.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and support, strength and innocence from the perspective of people living in the community who go to the streets and ask for answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrello’s dialogue with his daughter, dressed in flower dress and the same flower hats, on the subject that they had been doing many times before, "of experience with black".
"Do you remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed?" recalls the conversation.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"It didn't matter if I didn't take her with me," Ferrel later said.
"Today's events are a highlight... which came in the past.
She had to know and see her own eyes and grow up in it.
It needed to develop not only in activism and organisation but also in the different kinds of experience with black people and what we need to do in order to be free.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions that do not exist on her own skin racism, it does not differ in any way from another black child-wife.
I feel that if I protected her from this experience, I would only hurt her."
After arriving in Ferguson, the first stop was South Florissant Road against the police department, which became the main activists who were expecting the words of police officer Darrena Wilson on his case-by-case involvement in the incident.
This is where Ferrel met his daughter with a local businessman who was preparing for another meal.
They prepared food for the bags and helped spread it to the Protestants.
In Ferrello's eyes, he began to have a little bit of a new type of activism.
"My activism turned up on 9 August," Ferrello said and added that at a high school study at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was the president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn Association and applied for health care and food in the black communities.
"I had no experience with the organisation.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, Ferrel met with a later colleague, Sabaah Folayan during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farr wanted to "document" the current events.
However, Ferrello said: “Do you work on the document or are you trying to find a story that you would like to use?"
Such scepticism has spread into the community through many people, often white people who wanted to cause pain and resolve.
As Folayan explained in a recent discussion: "We have heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are very often mentioned and we wanted to change this."
Folayan has already referred to his collaboration with his co-founder Damon Davis, who is known as a local artist who lives in prison throughout his life.
He also took part in the project with Ferrello and the other six local residents who followed the "Whose Streets" team in the following years after Brown's murder.
"No one is talking about us in this document, but it is our statement," Davis said.
"That was important to me - how these people will be represented - because I will be represented in the same way."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrello's experiences - in an attempt to show that the urge "is not about a rescue leader but about bringing closer to the community," Folayan said - it was shown that she was the most open to participation in filming.
The document “Whose Streets” describes the very personal aspect of Ferrello’s life, for example, as she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt like a nose," said Ferrello with a smile on his face when he thought about the first time she saw the final version of the document.
"But I understand that if I can do this work and clean up the blacks, I have to open up."
Besides this, the experience of Ferrello highlights the role of middle black women in a broader aspect of Black Lives Matter.
Two of the three founders - who responded to the murder of teenager Trayvona Martina in 2012 on social media campaigns under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves marvels.
"Black middle-aged women in leadership positions in the final outcome are behind the threat," Ferrello said, "because we are constantly fighting on more fronts.
Black middle women must be silent about these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that "the threat is in fact supported by black women and a large number of middle black women."
However, it remains that "this is not just a confirmatory matter" and Ferrel is not the main cornerstone of the document because of his views.
"It was just that she was a source of power and energy," she said.
"that she just felt in front of the lines is not an accident, as life on these cruisers in the skin of a black sub-wife is dangerous.
This wave of energy you feel before the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the television station cameras broke out their positions, but the heavy racial gap between the community and the police persists.
Ferrello's two-and-a-half-year condition for blocking the distance at demonstrations.
The socio-political atmosphere in the area, which he calls home, has been described as "misorder."
She's still in her effort to make a commitment from the moment she left three years ago to the streets of Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our networks."
There's a hot field on the Colins.
There were dozens of hunters on the scene. He also helped the guinea pig.
Not far from the Czech ship on Colinsky, between the towns of Bylany and Liblica, the forest burned from 14:00 on a 15-hectare blast.
The fire stopped spreading around 15:15, the firemen declared a third degree of fire spread out from four possibilities.
According to the speechist Ladislav Holomičík, fire from the air helped the lightning and the hurricane.
At 18:00, the fire was fired by the fire, causing damage to 700,000 crowns.
Ten professional and volunteer firemen fought on the spot.
Fire caused by a technical accident in the engine compartment.
Hasit also helped a gardener who had a total of six cups of water.
"We have given the owners instead of the offer until tomorrow 8:00 a unit of volunteers will watch him," Holomčik said today.
And Becoming Resemblance: Artfully creating portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the middle of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery is located immediately several faces of several different sections of the plate - white, black and dark - hung from the top on the streets. Each of them looks like the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the pockets of her mouth and hair that Chelsea Manning sent to her.
Manning's samples were sent from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where an ex-analytic recalls the 35-year sentence for misdeclaring secret cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines its experience with technology, IT and art, and Manning's - transsexual and promiscuous dissident, whose sentence was reduced to Obama three days before his departure from the position of President of the United States.
With an algorithmic analysis of DNA Manning and using 30 portraits to detect how a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a flash, if not an intellectual comment on DNA subsidization - like the many ways DNA can be interpreted - and the unintended determination of these interpretations, as well as the identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has since been talking about being considered a woman. It was judged in 2013 on the basis of twenty complaints, including violations of six Spanish laws, computer industry and theft.
All of her photos were kept by prison staff. On the public's behalf, only one black photograph in the lower quality that Manning's, apparently concerned, sits on the seat of the driver in the platinum blonde pair with which he is now connected.
In 2015, they continued to receive positive reactions to the Dewey-Hagborg project from 2012 Stranger Visions.
Under this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as non-computer cigarettes and chickens - to create possible images of these people.
And right now she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"Chystali interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to add the article to the portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of opening a new exhibition.
However, visitors or photographers were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea asking if she was interested in DNA portraits.
Art and its sealed museum have been camouflaged for two years through correspondence.
They even created comics called Supressed Images, an illustrated Shoili Kanungo who presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea was abused and could attend the exhibitions personally.
President Obama actually requested the release of Manning's comic book a few days after the release of the comic book, which has been a welcome change for several years in the military prison in Kansas.
It is interesting that the exhibition is taking place at the same time as Donald Trump is leading a war with people who are promoting the publication of government information and transgender soldiers, while he is trying to find new ways to boost his tweets in areas that he should support.
In response to the question regarding this particular time period, Dewey-Hagborg stated that "all is going on for some reason".
In an art release on one of the gallery walls Manning's great signature (the letter "i" in the title is derived from the heart) after the end of "the self-sustained association based on sex, race, sexuality and culture".
On the other hand, the sequence of its mitochondrial DNA - a percentage of letters C, G and A recorded.
By listing 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to a sophisticated scientific dictionary of art), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how amazingly similar, at least on the biological side, we are all.
"I hope that people will take it from us that our gene does not depend on whom we are and that genetic data are subjective and can be displayed by everyone," said Dewey-Hagborg. It is also seen in her work Spurious Memories in 2007 on the video theme.
"DNA will tell many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last sample of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page of the above-mentioned graphic news.
It depicts Manning, who is featured in the way King Kong from the United States Discipline Barracks prison with megaphone in his hand.
"As soon as they block you from the show, they win," she writes.
"Never let yourself be silent."
"It's a direct list of one of the letters," said Philadelf's artist.
"When I think about it, it's scarring my hair."
Manning's exhibit has not personally attended - which was required in the comic book - but when this happens, he will be greeted in the middle of the room with his masks, his own genotypes, cut off as a Protestant tax.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including about 160 cm high Manning's soybeans, which are closely marked by its genetic haploscopes.
"In the past they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted them to feel the tax," said Dewey-Hagborg about portraits.
"I wanted to point out the idea of a mass movement that takes Chelsea's image and frees her."
Professor of the North West University and an employee of Oxford University looking for murder
In those days, the international patrol was conducted by the professor of the North West University and the staff of the Oxford University, who were arrested for suspecting the murder of a man who was found sentenced to death in a luxury Chicago apartment.
On Monday he was released for the first-stage murder of a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, states the trial record Cook County.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died as a result of several minor wounds.
The Chicago police reported that the body of the dead was found on 27 July.
The police were warned by telephone. After arriving at Grand Plaza Apartments, they found a victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead and detectives investigating the murder.
Lathem worked as a teacher of microbiology and immunology of the North West University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of the University of Public Affairs, stated in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now authorized to administratively and has been banned from accessing university schools.
"The whole business is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and the North-West University is fully working with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at Oxford University.
The spokesman of the University and Somerville College announced by e-mail: "We have been contacted by the British police and we are also ready to assist the American police."
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were all shocked and willing to join the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, a leading contact with the public of the Chicago Police Department, said he was calling for suspects to be given to the relevant authorities.
"The police have information about their place of residence and the effort to expel suspects is underway," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and international authorities are assisting the police in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a telephone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had been warned about the incident to come into apartment No. 1008.
The police have described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it's not clear whether the incident occurred on July 27th.
He added that Lathem and Warren were caught with security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza Management has issued a statement for all residents: "The police are now working on the creation of a time review and victim profile and examining various motives, including domestic violence."
"In the near future we will complete the WADA plan" - Russian government Vice-President Mutko
The Vice-President of the Russian Government, Vitaly Mutko, stated that it will not last long and will come to the implementation of the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"At present, part of the new plan criteria has already been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this fact, the WADA plan was updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA's plan to issue a code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which has recently been published on the website of the organisation.
According to the Mutka Codex, there is nothing to worry about Russia.
"All has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA at the latest," he added.
However, one of these criteria calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA survey conducted by Richard McLaren on the data on the monitoring of Russian athletes' doping by the government.
Mutko said on this subject: “We know the investigation, since our antidoping system is clearly under control.
It was adapted to all measures.
However, there were no state programmes in our country and we can't admit to something that never existed."
Mutkov's words confirmed Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
In the Russian RSport Smirnov's discussion, he acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but he added: “In many cases we have indicated that the report contains a controversial situation and a regulation.
No one plans to accept the message completely without reward," Smirov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSSADU of issuing doping controls in Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation allowed the planning and merger of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June.
Following a visit by the Moscow centre organisation in July, general director-general WaDA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "on the right path" to renew its validity.
The police charged three people, one young man.
The police accused three men of setting up a fire in the middle of a rare wooden church in Trinci-Gutech on Früdecko-Mesteck.
One accused is young, all three are Czech tribes.
They are threatened with a crime of general threat for up to 15 years in prison.
Tomáš Kužel told the journalists today.
He said it was a deliberate criminal act.
"It is a very clean business and the police are currently working on the whole of it," said Kužel.
He indicated that the police would deal with possible arrests of the accused.
Further information may not be published by the Director.
"I can't communicate anymore, because the police and investigation and state representatives are actually working on this thing," Kuzel said.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutech dates back to the 16th century.
He was a valuable memory with many original equipment and pictures from the first half of the 16th century.
Mass damages are estimated to amount to tens of millions of crowns, but historical losses are unpredictable.
The flames after the fire began to be considered as a reconnaissance of the church.
Most of the costs should cover insurance, other costs are prepared to share with the Ministry of Culture and City, the public collection is also being prepared and the memory owner's contribution is calculated, so local literacy.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabov also destroyed 15 years ago fire.
That's how it got to be installed.
And then there was an exact copy of it.
State counts with citizens in the defence of the state.
He'll support their training.
With financial support for public defence companies, voluntary training or training training teams, the law on the preparation of citizens for the defence of the State shall be deemed to be a permanent objective.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been entrusted with the task of the government, promises that it will be able to increase the physical competence of the Czech people and their abilities which could then be used in crisis situations.
This is based on a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law had been adopted in the future, the state would have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in support of defence.
The main objective of the proposal is to create an effective system to help improve the readiness of the citizens of the Czech Republic to defend the State, in addition to the performance of defence duties and on the basis of volunteers.
For example, the State would support broadcasters, shooters or cynologists financially or material and would enable their members to improve their capabilities.
He would obtain information on people who are willing to come to the country in need of help during the crisis and on their abilities or material equipment.
There could also be accreditation of instructors who would help companies and other stakeholders in training or training.
It is also calculated by organizing a word with war veterans or people who have been treated as gardeners.
One of the possible options is that there would be a new authority which would be responsible for the administrative and coordination of the project.
The authors point out that the participation of people should be voluntary and that the State would use their capabilities until the status of threat has been declared.
"The whole concept must respect the progressive tightening of apparent boundaries between individual types of threats," states the reference to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
The ministers noted that it was therefore necessary to focus on support for the largest number of capabilities, not just those of the military.
"The main objective of the plan is to create a very broad basis which enables each citizen to react adequately to situations that threaten the well-being of the State or of his or her life, health and property, to protect himself, where appropriate, by contributing to the protection of others, and not to impose undue burden on the peoples of the armed forces of the Czech Republic," he says.
The adoption of the law would result in a lack of financial guarantees.
The above will depend on the option chosen by the Ministry.
For example, the Authority proposes financial support for projects to prepare citizens for state protection up to 100 million koruna.
If an administrative and coordination centre was set up, its operation could be approximately 60 million koruna per year.
Other money would go to pay or build an information system.
The proposal also suggests that the scope of the national military leaders should be extended, which would total 42 other soldiers.
The representatives of the ministries have already stated that the law should also help to resolve some of the Czech policies in the light of the introduction of a European Union directive on the possession of weapons.
It would allow firemen who will be part of the system to leave some of the weapons that the directive commands.
Startups that your companies will help you lose another Uberem
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of his e-commerce employees, but she didn't find the appropriate research.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even
And although she promised an anonymous investigation, some employees expressed their lack of confidence throughout the process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of the e-commerce company of Madison Reed hair care company with a residence in San Francisco, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for help from the serpent.
New start-ups from the human resources range continue to appear on the market, helping companies to investigate employees' satisfaction.
By creating and licensed software with a specific purpose of measuring employees' duties, they enable start-ups with companies to take rapid vote, target specific teams and demographic groups, continue to offer easy anonymity of employees and a hot line for burden-sharing, and in some cases they also allow informers to cover their tasks and contact the Director directly.
"There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that follow your health status, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and director general of Glint's Glint's career in Redwood City.
Erett said that thanks to Glint for three years, she had more information about what her employees think and how they feel.
In addition to the rapid research and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company's heat map and a regular review of groups with the highest number of difficulties, as well as a review of low-value managers - which allows users to work on repair.
The companies start to realize that it is necessary to focus on the culture of the working environment - in case another Uber - would become involved in scandals after an ex-employer published on his blog a contribution describing the business environment and the difficulties of employees who are reluctant to speak openly.
For startups such as Glint, the demand for research into the company culture is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which is supported by technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance by 2020 can exceed $118.8 billion.
The launch of Converter from Denver in Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, saw a small increase in interest and activities at the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandal.
Some 600 Converter clients are Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently he also accepted Uber under his wing.
Like Glint, Convertert allows companies to send appropriate "bile" research, collect reliable information in real time and display heat maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, the difficulties are addressed directly by the Governing Council.
"The Court of Public Opinion has strengthened regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and executive director of the Converter.
If the company is certified by unfair treatment with its employees or non-ethical behaviour - and if the regulators do not intervene - it may have cost-effective consequences as a result of the loss of customers, employee abuse or judicial proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant, which employs more than 25,000 people over 500 locations, uses Converter over a year to increase employees' awareness of company principles and procedures and to ensure the easy way to contact corporate management.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to check his phone number or e-mail on the management of the company, officially place the difficulty and hope in the solution.
Often it was a frightening and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, general representative of Ruby Tuesday, who did not have a reliable way to monitor the difficulties of employees.
Now that the company is using the Converter, it is ensured that rapid detection and solutions to problems that have never been found to managers who sit in offices have been able to deal with the real difficulties, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"This is close to a comprehensive, comprehensive view of the experience of employees," said Vitrano, who runs a group of Ruby Tuesday looking at risk management.
"At the same time, we protect the shareholders from court disputes by employees."
The companies stopped taking ethics, values and employee participation on an easy weight in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed after the fall of Enron in respect of the abuse of the ethical rights of employees, Quinlan said.
But as soon as "you've enlightened the whole thing on social media", companies began to realize that they can't simply hide their costumes in the dark online world.
"Before people began to use technology ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint and Converter offers their software in the form of services for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity to recognise the considerable capital of investors who supported both startups.
Converter chose his company's campaign as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital total $10 million and finally took up the capital of $47 million.
Glint won $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and earned $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are challenges which are surprising in view of the relationship between society, culture and risk capital.
The increasing number of research confirms clearly that today's employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in the competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, they are not the main benefits of high wages and interesting projects.
Employees want to be aware that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are spending their time with companies that are trying to send a positive message.
"If people in their work are happy, they realize that their voice is heard and that their work is rewarding, they are building on the success of society," said Nina McQueen, vice-president of global benefits and employee benefits of LinkedIn, which uses Convertert i Glint.
Investors make when they give to companies and companies thrive when they are at peace with their employees.
And when there is an analytical tool on the market that ensures the engagement and commitment of employees against the company, it is not surprising that there are many investors supporting this effort.
It is important to provide data on the satisfaction of employees, according to workers in working culture.
But the data alone are ineffective if the company does not take the necessary steps.
In fact, when a company asks for a return from its employees, it can make a big difference.
And if the change does not happen quickly - in the worst case - it can lead to corruption and the lack of interest on the part of employees.
“When you ask for 4,000 views, you need to be prepared for 4000 conversions,” said Russell Raath, director of the consulting company Kotter International, who was witnesses to many companies who relied too much on their own data.
“Because once you don’t get to the end, employees start asking, ‘Did they even hear me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should it interest me?"
Madison Reed, which now regularly conducts a survey between employees every month, can solve the problem one day by using Glintu.
After gathering back from employees who were frustrated with slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganise several teams within the company and start training communication to solve the problem effectively.
Ruby Tuesday has a very important view of its employees and hopes that from a long-term perspective it will achieve high employment in a field known as a common escape.
"If you do not insist on creating a transparent working environment, your employees will not believe you," adds Vitrano.
“And when you start losing your job, you will become customers.
And with the help of customers, the whole company is falling apart."
Thursday became the hottest day.
Thursday with 38.3 degrees recorded in The Watch Tower at Hodoninska is the most intense day of the year in the Czech Republic.
He was so impressed by the Tuesday that he was originally the hottest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
They informed the staff of the Czech Hydrometerological Institute.
On the other hand, Tuesday afternoon, but there's not much heat records.
The water was mainly occupied by Morava, which was mainly in Czechia.
In the afternoon, records of 35 of 145 meteorological stations were exceeded or balanced for more than 30 years.
On Thursday the record recorded only nine long-term measuring stations.
Today’s temperature may have been the same as that of the previous issue of 2013.
In the Netherlands today, 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum of four decades in the Netherlands and in the Netherlands the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record of three decades.
Both records have been published in The Watchtower since 2013.
High temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia today.
After the Watchtower there was the biggest road in the Dyjákovices on the South Sea and the ship over Dyjja on the coast of Bréclavka, where there was a steady flow of grain at 37.8 degrees, but the record did not pass.
On the contrary, for example, in Western and North-West Czech countries, the CHHMU website has been using today only about 22 degrees Fahrenheit [22 ° C].
"The temperatures started to grow there until now in the afternoon," the meteorologists reported.
The current fleet in the Czech Republic will be gradually reimbursed according to the CHAMU and will be able to reach even more significant rains on Sunday.
Most of Moravi, but high temperatures will remain on Friday and on the southeastern part of Moravia and on Saturday.
We've had this kind of trouble here.
Billions don't have the same voice in the elections as every single person in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not all are as tough as Andrey Babish, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penty Marek Dospiva, along with other water colleagues Martin Burdau and Antonín Frych, sponsors Robešk's Realist.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is funded by the owner of insurance and the entrepreneur in real terms by Paul Sehnal, who is also the president.
The convicted corrupter and the king of the Czech Hazard Ivo Valent ordered the private party.
The political ambition of Agrofert, how the project Andreje Babishe did not want to be named by Croatian archaeologist Jaroslav Germany, is a chapter for himself.
They've recently caught their billionaires, too.
He's Dalibor Grandfather, owner of Jablotron's security facility.
According to his own words, he's getting into politics so he can go well.
The entry in the old-fashioned dress didn't mean much to Grandpa.
"I've never had a small goal," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is to push the UN to win the old man's vote by twenty percent.
Leckdo's gone.
Grandfather's transition is more significant.
Milliard Dalibor Grandfather is a man of strong opinion.
If she likes to talk about the voice of the voters in the old-fashioned style, she continues to support Andrey Babish.
Grandfather Babishe supported in previous parliamentary elections.
"Babish is not a speaker shot and does not control a favorite rhetoric of political parties," he wrote before the 2013 elections.
But he's definitely not going to politics because he wants to improve himself personally.
Babi's gonna be a hero for me.
He's willing to get out of his world under control and do something for us all.
Shortly after the olds presented her as a new force, she was recognized from her vision of Babish again.
And he said he wanted the Olds to learn how to work with Babish.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa doesn't change his mind and stand behind him no matter what dress he wears.
Others can speculate whether Babi's sending to the old people to build his daughter-in-law like this.
Further questions can be asked if the chief of Jablotron and Chief Agrofert didn't get involved in the trade and he doesn't look for another way to defend his commercial rival.
The first Grandfather's public performance was not just around Babish.
Grandfather promised that the Old Ones would be sent to a campaign of ten million crowns.
And when they need more money, they send more.
A few years ago, it would be difficult for anyone to stop over a similar product.
Lastly, the convicted Gauner of Bakala before the 2010 elections spread millions on all sides.
The political division of the security agencies Viita Barty, TOP 09 and the citizens of democracy came together in this way to a total of thirty million.
Well, today's another time.
The law prohibits any political party to give more than three million.
Once Grandpa's in politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Then maybe he wouldn't ask himself why he's got such a bad report on our politics.
Then, on his first day in politics, Grandpa crowned the proposal for a tax settlement of the family with the children studied.
People with high school education will come to us every month for a quarter of a thousand.
You're based on the 20th century.
A person with tens of thousands is more rich than any other.
The one with the twenty poor.
In Grandpa's vision, poor companies pay taxes in a positive way, and the rich enjoy the benefits of working in a social state that they do not share too much.
The rich need short help not to push the poor with necessity.
Older people can greet each other in their new aquivises, and Babis will wash your hands.
We're the rest of us, thanks to Grandpa, we can prove that billions are not good people.
Then there's still a question of who to choose.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to keep them.
Those who are members of their own country or citizens and citizens of the State do not have their employees and land for their own property.
And finally, those who want to live well in a rich country are not just people.
There was no one in Tromp's paradise.
The villa complex had to be reduced by 234 million.
Selling property is never easy.
And sometimes he can't even help 11 bedrooms, a beautiful sea view, or the fact that property sells US President Donald Trump.
At the sale of the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price went down for an incredible 8 million pounds.
He reported on this website Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says, "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Stay away from the place like nobody else.
Even the real association with the US President did not encourage extreme prices.
Donald Trump had to reduce the price of his Caribbean home for incredible 8 million pounds.
The original real estate price was 21.5 million pounds, the final price was 13 million pounds.
Even after that, the villa complex is about 76 medium-sized apartments in the center of Prague.
And it's nothing to be surprised about.
The beautiful 5-acre apartment on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin has 12 fully equipped bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, plenty of food, strength and other rooms.
It's made up of several buildings.
Part of the land is also a pool and a tennis court.
There are dozens of palm trees on the ground.
From the terrace is a beautiful view of the sea.
According to realistic experts, the fact that the connection with the president is not sufficient to attract potential buyers has been demonstrated.
Now property is closer to the usual prices of real estate on the island.
Trump bought property in 2013.
According to estimates, he paid about 15 million pounds.
The real estate was to be purchased for the purpose of rent.
Only Chateau des Palmiers was the most precious property on the island of Saint Martin.
It's a new price, but it's in second place.
The real estate in the neighborhood was estimated at 13.5 billion pounds.
NCAA decided to finish two exercises a day.
Nearly eleven UCLA UCLA football players are playing on the outside of the new school play.
Some of them are wearing suits and revealing their worn back, an unkempt sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most members of these teams, a few minutes of rest will take place in the morning.
Players will go to the rooms after a three-hour training course to study at final exams before they return to the Waterman Football Center at a meeting that will take place in the morning at 6:30.
"For these guys, the next three days will be a regular cat," said coach Bruins Jim Mora some time before breakfast last morning.
By setting up two coaches in one day NCAA wants to avoid players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until the end of the final test.
That's why the first three UCLA trainings are planned at 19:15 - to cheer themselves up to so many students' already overpaid papers.
Even for the first six season that Mora spent at the trainer's position in Westwood, the training camp in Bruins starts a week earlier than last year and the trainings are limited during the annual season. It also has a decision to limit the number of trainers from two to one day.
Eighty coaches are planned by 20 August, and formal preparations are under way for the first game against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September.
He must have been allowed to hear that he was supporting NCAA's decision, although it added another item to the already loaded player's diary.
"Three or four days are players under great stress and it's very frustrating for them," said Mora.
"But no one has given it up, everyone is trying. They're great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything's cool."
The UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy to look at a clear line of surrounding lands from the adjacent parking lot and the luxury hotel Luskin Center, which includes players after the closing of the network for the branch chain.
The Bruins players should have a hotel stay this week, but Mora admits that when the room is empty during the season, it could be a problem.
"The land will be kept safe," Mora added.
"The security is provided, but it is not excluded that someone can find a room and play our coaches.
He's dealing well with such materials.
The hotel will be happy to watch the security, just as the parking lot is 8.
We're using our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything's gonna be okay.
It's all planned."
Facebook is planning a more thorough control of the facts to limit the number of false reports
Facebook will send more potentially counterfeit articles to third parties to control and show the findings under their original contributions in an attempt to fight the so-called "fake news", the largest social network in Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible chaos that will send third parties to check and potentially display the results of the investigation under the original contributions.
Facebook has been marked as one of the main sources of false reports and many believe that these unconfirmed reports have influenced the presidential vote of the United States.
In Europe, political debate is all about. French voters are flooded with false reports of flower presidential elections, and Germany plans to cut down on the social media network as soon as it does not remove any angry contributions.
On Thursday, in his next statement published in Germany, Facebook indicated that it was about to launch a new test of the control of false reports in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to viewing reports verified by third parties, people ask more content to be better informed and can make the right decision on what they can share," said Sara Su, the product manager of the Facebook company's report.
He added that Facebook continues to test the function of "related articles" and also works on other changes with a view to reducing the number of false reports.
Create graphic news: story about A Castle in England
The small garden of Scottney Castle recently played its main role in the music video clip of the Squeeze group and its site was also found by Margaret Thatcher during the 70th and 80th centuries.
However, Scottney was from his quiet place at the Bewl River in British Kent for 700 years of heated history inspired by the contemporary Jamie Rhodes of York City - known interest in historical documents - to create graphic news.
"Look at the letter of a man who's 300 years after death fascinated me," says Rhodes with a serious face.
"When I hold the letter in my hand, I feel personal connection."
The graphic news A Castle in England documents the life of families who lived in the city of Scottney from the middle ages to the time of Eduardo. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smithová, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first book of Rhodes inspired archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of inspired documents from the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"He touched me with the print of his finger on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for James," he said.
"That's the print of his fingers!
And the letters always smell like smoke because at those times you had to burn a candle to read.
If I'm going to write it now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love the archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, support is from the National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility of spending almost four months on the wall almost like a dream. (“To tell the truth, I’ve stayed a little longer.”)
Rhodes spent time examining the Victorian "new" building, passing archives and studying many warehouses and curiosities, such as the head of hyenas on the walls and boxes that were left behind after the fall.
He walked through the land and examined the ruins of the old city, talked to the geniuses, gardeners, and sometimes also with artists who worked on illustrations to his book.
In the night, "he drank whiskey and wrote."
The trust history of Scottney is relatively unknown as the National Trust has gained access to documents until 2006 after the death of its last grandfather, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at a place ten years later, employees began to break into the archives that Rhodes described as "the aristocrats of many centuries spread their hands with the words 'You know this in the undercover'."
The journals, letters from the British Empire, maps showing properties: "You may think that the land dispute is boring," Rhodes said, "but I found one case when two families took over the bridge.
Let the people go!"
Some stories in the book use the garden as a reflection bridge and go deeper into English history, including the story called The Laborer, which follows the man who leaves the newly built garden to join the English Resurrection in 1381.
"I found a report on the construction of a building from 1380, which was in the book Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes said.
“In fact, the English revolt started in this area and I felt that the argument was a good starting point.
Maybe it's somehow connected together."
The other stories are certainly contrary to the history of the garden - for example The Priest who tells the story of the Jesuit priest who hid Darrell's family after seven years during the English reform.
Or The Smuggler of the 18th century was named Arthur Darrell, who probably underestimated his own funeral when he completed the rock cancer (which was discovered up to a few years after the discovery of the remains).
Rodes ’ beloved family is Darrell’s: “The men were always indebted to me and spent money on things they couldn’t afford.
The different generations of Darrell's family have solved this by taking the rich or the old girls - I imagine they were lookin' gentlemen, who, with a look on their heads, gave them their heads up."
With the end of the stay on the wall, five Rhodes will be on the other side.
He recently returned from a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness, where he inspired his next book about Elämenmäki, an ancient sanatorium from the beginning of the 20th century, which was enthralled by nature.
For Scottney, however, it's a special place.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I said, 'Now let me go back to real life."
Washington changes the terms and conditions of making green cards
The media has published the words of President Donald Trump on a new U.S. immigration plan, which will also change when making green cards.
It is expected that the number of legal immigrants will be reduced by 50,000 per year as a result of more stringent rules for the administration of temporary labour visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The draft law will soon be submitted to Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, increases fraud and saves billions of dollars for taxpayers. We aim to change the rules for the issue of green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law limits the number of immigrants and replaces the current scheme.
A new application process for English-speaking English-speaking applicants, who are benefiting from financial resources and demonstrating skills that will contribute to the well-being of our country," said Trump, quoted in the media.
Sexual jobs are on the rise - we should be on the alert.
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more remarkable, a report on the technological development of sexual robots appears on the Internet.
Yes.
Sexual work is currently really popular.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a declaration on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the Sheffield University and co-founder FRR Noela Sharkey, it is necessary to take a serious look at the rise of sexual robots.
Customers can choose the color of their eyes, the shape of their beards and due to work wear.
"People are attracted to them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more often," Sharkey said for the opportunity to publish the message.
Modern sexual assistance changes from you to a working woman with silicone skin, which is mildly hot on the flow - of course is an artificial intelligence that likes human behavior.
The user can work "correct" to his image - from the color of his eyes and shape of his beard to the look and color of his noses.
It is very disturbing, however, that many robots have their own "person", which would also be ignoring Stepford's panic.
Modern women were raised in a working woman with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix job can set up different character traits between his wife and her.
And then there's a sexual robotic woman Roxxxy Gold company True Company, which is supplied with pre-programmed personalities, including "fridge Farrah", which is marked by a shy attitude and "Windy Wendy" with "good company".
“The Roxxxy Gold personality is set up so that your personality can be expressed to the maximum extent possible,” writes the website of the True Company.
So he likes what you like, and he likes it.
He's even so cute, just like people.
It can be tense, talk or be "in the mood".
The rise of sexual robots is alarming for several reasons - among other things there is no exchange for real mesilid relationships. The concern is rather similar female character traits and violent threats - such as cold (read exciting) Farrah.
The company True Company compares Roxxxy to a vibrator for men on its websites.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why couldn't she have a husband Roxxxy?" is written on the page.
Sexual work, however, is not just fetish or sexual help.
Their origins and almost perfect sophistication show something more darker and deep rooted in our culture - departure from ideal or semi-equanimity towards temptation after subjective sex with voluntary attraction.
Most men do not deliberately buy a woman working and while the FRR talks about their growing love, sex workers remain on the edge of the broad public interest.
However, this regional interest can become a reflection of modern times.
And most people aren't weird or violent until they're caught up in a free market.
There is no way that these sophistication sex jobs appear at a time when women around the world are enjoying their rights and in the White House is the president who is often very jealous of women.
The most horrendous aspect of the service history series is not what we see - the body and the eyes we see, as the reality of these visions increases.
The Office’s Pre-Tribe Manual presents a step in the right direction, but at the same time it seems to be a small step.
Sexual jobs are available where possible as much as possible like real women (may be relatively low in pornography).
Their shapes are designed so that they are acceptable to the touch and are capable of looking first as a real woman.
However, when it comes to their "identity", the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't split up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history, nothing that would undermine their independence or break their loyalty to their master.
In other words, they're nice kids.
He says the 21st century: servants.
The NBA star on the green watch.
Curry's fighting in California about a knife.
The star basketballist Stephen Curry did not lose his first shot at the start of the premier among professional golfers.
Double rating holder for the lowest NBA player played on the tournament Ellie Mae Classic lower series Web.com Tour in California Hayward's first cycle on 74 ran and will fight about Cut.
The Golden State player, who received a second title in NBA with the Warriers team in this season, began very nervously and his first departure ended in the hold on his drink in a golf vehicle parked at the fairway.
Even after the net he wasn't as precise as under the basketball box, although he left ten professionals with his balance four mornings over a couple.
"It wasn't the best way to start, I had to call the decisionor right after the first time, but then it just sat down for a while," said Curry with a huge strain fell on him.
It was very nervous to fire the first morning at the tournament, but it was all I expected.
"If you told me I was playing 74 in the first round, I'd take it right away," he added.
If Curry is able to struggle with a knife that will probably be two wounds under a pair, he will become the first representative of another sport that will prove this on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've had my time off, it's almost over," said an inspired golfer who has been playing at tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he starts first on a tournament that falls under PGA.
In part, Ellie Mae Classic received a sponsoral exception and maintained an amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
A big win for the trumpet?
In contrast, Mitt Romney is a healthy mind healer.
The silent symbol of the Trump era is political divisions that divide American voters and destroy the entire family in a micro-measuring way.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving season, it was popular in American newspapers for advice on how to deal with relatives who love Trump.
We're probably just waiting for it to get us nervous.
However, less attention is required to focus on the family's ability to drive.
I'm talking about the fact that this week my sister in New York visited me - a nurse and a fan of the left who lives in Chicago and who paid our family for a long time after the Republican fool.
She reminded me that jealousy in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, there is a single family - including all the republican relatives who have been interested in politics for years - on one leave.
It's a good thing to have dinner at the family table; but I'm surprised that this poses a significant risk in a broader context.
Theump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has a great impact on all of us transport.
If we are talking about "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the terrible possibility that one day his scarf can lose its attractiveness.
There is, however, a much wider long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the right-wing republics who, in accordance with its standards, will suddenly recover from what can be called rational.
In these days with nostalgia in my heart I remember Mitta Romney and his version of crazy behavior - dog on the roof of the car, 14% tax from income (at least we had knowledge of his tax recognition) - both of which appear to be very peaceful in comparison with Trump.
Following the departure of the Trupa, the next Republican candidate will be at least normal, which will be an indisputable improvement.
We used my sister's visits and took the children to Central Park on the largest corner that runs the New York Park department - you will not find any better use for your three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the middle war is covered with slamming - clowns and animals are pointed and in danger they look at their own shoulders - quite glamorous view and cicada music is a reminder of public transport.
A lot of crests will soon die: view of the high buildings, panorama looks forward to, instead of breathing the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
About fifteen years later, I still didn't understand the fact that Swiss Cottage is not actually Switzerland's cheese - not counting thematic lord Ye Old Swiss Cottage - but the metro station in London.
However, the Colotoč in Central Park is a highly magical experience, to the point that it is a great fun for two-year-old children, as well as two older women.
If I could value the ring, I'd earn the maximum points, but no one's asking for luck.
This week I had a similar experience in the store when I was asked to assess my "life" at a level from one to five.
In the coffee shop on my street, it's the same thing, by the way, that I can come up with a 15% discount for something I'm buying for the pool.
Not only does it mention another quick sale, but the server is so forced to turn into cheap buyers when it's not necessary.
The woman at the store apologized to me with a smile when I misappropriated my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is already second to what Pistorius had to be transferred to the hospital.
Last year he was injured because of several injuries on his wrists, which, according to the prison statement, caused his own fall to the ground.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after the original trial of murder.
He killed his friend Steinkamp in early morning hours at Valentine in 2013 several shooting wounds through the toilet door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said you were online stealing her.
The complainants announced their idea of revoking this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which is too peaceful according to their words.
National Prosecuting Authority stated that it refers to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the Court of Justice is still in effect this year.
In the event of success, Pistorius is threatened with prolonging the sentence for up to 15 years.
In the South African Republic there is no death penalty.
For the first time in history, a young man was born into a beloved panda that had grown up in a wild.
It's a big success for the Pand rescue program.
The Centre is still trying to expand the genofand of the gangs that are held in custody.
Čang Č-chung told the New China agency that his behavioural panda poses a major risk arising from the urban crossing.
Only 471 pandas lived at the end of last year.
Only two thousand live in a free environment.
Trying to keep up with those weird cops is such a first step to help protect this kind of panda.
The Cchao-cchao Patnacy was released into the natural reserve at the beginning of the spring of the 11th March period.
Thanks to the tracking device on the breast, scientists were able to observe every step of it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
He had sex with his own girlfriend for a minute and a half and he was successful.
This can also be seen as a small miracle because the birds are not considered to be the most successful millennia of animal breeds.
Sami have a relatively bad estimate of time when alone is ready, and they are often confused and confused about what to do.
The young man was born healthy and, even since Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, he weighed 216 grams after birth.
The average weight of newly-born pancakes is 70 grams below.
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that two Bulgarian tourists in Greece were detained for illegal camping, a statement quoted by BTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained on 1st August in early hours by the Cityan police.
They were all released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced for bTV that the Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have clarified the rules of free camping and shall make sure that everyone who is arrived at a place where camping is not allowed.
Checks will take place throughout the season.
The Ministry indicated that the court could impose a fine.
The ball is after the first British Open round at the fifteenth place.
The golf course of Klara Spillkova is located next to the first major British Open on the 50th floor.
The game in Scottish Kingsburns took a score of one hit under a pair when she played three times Birdie and twice bogey.
A 12-year-old Czech player is so hopeful that he'll first go to the famous major.
In the contest of $3.25 million, the best American star Michele Wie, who won the first round in the 64-year record of the game, then eight under the pair.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are making millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands alone has already closed 180 refugees due to the incident.
The Dutch Food Safety Authority NVWA, according to the Reuters Agency, announced that it is investigating 20 per cent of all Dutch farmers, which means that 80 per cent of eggs on the market are unusual.
The Authority pointed out that the risk represents only a limited number of eggs known according to specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the number of toxic substances in eggs is not present for adult hazards, but the potential risk is for children.
The Czech SVS SVS Petr Major reported that the eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities have also joined in the closure of the proceedings, have not recently been brought to the Czech Republic.
However, the veterinarians will take samples of eggs and meat from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, which have identified the problem signs of insecticide.
According to the Czech veterinary authorities, the eggs from Belgium were last in depth and the eggs from the Netherlands last in May.
The cooking mass from Belgium finally appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there are certain quantities of smoked meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of anti-drugs, all and keys.
However, animals whose mass is consumed must not be given.
The World Health Organization WHO considers preparation to be peaceful toxic.
His high doses lead to a sense of discomfort and rejection.
Riga's beautiful, I'm going to miss her, she's calling me a big sitter and she's looking for a job.
I'd like to catch up to ten years.
"I'm supposed to go back there once," he said to a 27-year-old Sedláček who could start the season in a bad dress.
It depends on whether he gets a job by the start of the new anniversary.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I were to evaluate it like at school, I'd be three.
I didn't get much in the first year, I had an experienced general before me.
I learned.
The second year I started to catch.
A third season ago I thought they were giving me more space.
But they brought in a new crowd I was dealing with again.
Lony, I thought I'd catch it all the time.
But during the initial ten games, we got about five points, so the trainers started running.
At last, he's got more of my partner.
But that's what he's doing.
They wanted to play it next season.
What was life like in Riz?
That's great.
It's little Praha.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'll miss him.
I found my girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, and next year we're gonna get married.
So I got something.
How's KHL available for bankers?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are men like us or Sloven, who have to change their artistic style against him.
The ability is on the other hand, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more back, more fighting.
I didn't see a problem in the whole game.
The difference is that the Russians want to play empty.
They're less shots, and even though they've got a half-way front, they're more likely to play.
In the Czech Republic, they only shoot more.
Didn't it make you a problem traveling and moving over seven hours?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep quietly.
The program is mostly made so you need to play four outdoors and then you have two days off.
How do Lotish guys even take care of their club in KHL?
As a national team.
Lotyski's watching hockey, together with basketball, is national sport.
He's fucking everybody.
Even though it didn't happen, a lot of people went.
Did Dinam’s impact on the KHL help to ensure that Latvia did not move to the fourth quarter of the world’s annual ministry?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And since then their results have begun to go up to the mystery of the world.
At the Olympics 2014 in Soci, they fell in the fourth terminal with Canada at 1:2.
It was an ineffective result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they got to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading into the Czech extralegiate.
In Zlín, Roberts Bukarts crossed the line and before signing the contract is Ralphs Freibergs.
What's going on here so much?
They're not any basketball players, they're really quality.
Local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Lotish among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL is already starting in three weeks.
Why are you still without a job?
I knew I wouldn't go on in Riz by the beginning of the summer.
We started looking for something after this fall.
There was Sparta on the table.
But because they didn't have to pay the rent, we didn't agree.
Then it was classic.
We've been dealing with different teams, but they finally decided for someone else.
So I'm going home in Zline and I'm gonna wait until something happens.
Aren't you nervous about it?
I was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best. On the other hand, I'm home for some time.
I got something out of KHL, so I'm gonna take it differently.
The question only sounds like when and where to sign.
How real is the option that a new anniversary will be set up in Zline?
It can happen anything.
We'll see what's going to happen in a month where what's going to be done.
Now I can just wait for the agent to talk.
You prefer any competition?
The current season wasn't like that so I could choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's on the flight.
In January of this year, I was in article S of the care of the proper economy? I also wrote about the camp in Flightch in Orlík.
The subject of the problem remains the same, so I allow the complainant to remind him of the article.
He's been talking about the camp in Flightch for years.
For readers who don't know exactly what it is about, it'll probably be the best when they look at official pages of cultural monuments Fifth place of the summer.
It is found in the introduction of a historical review that the camp became two miles east of the city of Latvia, that since 8.8. 1940 it has served as a labor camp, since 1.1.42 he has been a collective camp and since 2.8.42 he has been a disciple camp.
The next text describes the life course of the camp, including the Negede conditions, until March 1943, when the first prison flight was scheduled to take place in world transport.
On 4.5.43, 370 persons were transported by the largest transport to the voting camp.
There were 420.
Very sad stories of the incorrigible eviction of human beings, which caused them once again human beings and imaginative ideologies.
There is no argument that these events need to be kept in mind.
There is no question that this reminder should be played at the memory instead of surviving the suffering of these people.
There's another problem.
The socialism of the Jaxi camp was slightly reminiscent, and in the 1970s it was nearing and was built on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp came to light in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, a monument was discovered in the summer of 1995.
In the mid - 1990 ’ s, the government promised to buy and harvest grapes, but it has not yet.
In 1998, the Memorial was declared to be a cultural memory, and its management is under the Lidice Memorial since 2009.
In July 2013, the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations called on the Czech Republic to close the autumn.
That's a very technical fact about the slow trial of the court.
As soon as the government signed a tender, it approved a tender and decided that a noticeable award should be drawn up for the determination of the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will buy the web.
According to Herman's Culture Minister, "there are some numbers, but I'd probably dream of these purposes if I went to public with them."
We'll see what a professional trial will bring.
According to some non-official estimates, it can be estimated that hundreds of millions can reach a billion.
As in any case, it's not going to matter.
However, only a few hundred yards from the former camp is a monument to which the state has invested nearly ten million dollars in 2010.
Although the UN Committee on Human Rights has been funding the entire transaction in advance, which is obviously not a threat, it would be the same as I think it would be to raise money.
What does the government have no other priorities?
A memorial, an appropriate fifth place, is the will of the stories of practical events in the immediate vicinity of the past tragedy and any who wish to remember the suffering and the slain can be given here.
I don't see any reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and let's keep the fifth place with maximum care.
In this case, the Government of the Czech Republic should deal with the care of the proper economy on the property entrusted, including the money of taxpayers.
At least with someone like your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Vice-President of the Government is not the whole government.
However, I take note of the above facts that lead to the UN's entry into force as an empty pre-trial declaration.
This year in May, I went straight to the spot.
Very convenient road, repaired parking, reciprocating wooden camp bars.
In one exhibition, in another integrated WC with current water.
A small natural amphitheater with a seating capacity and with a view to its own fifth place, which is made up of stones placed in a peaceful atmosphere.
A set of flowers and flowers.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place as it listens and belongs.
At present, he is conducting archaeological research at the site of the original camp.
It would be wise to consider whether, for example, it would be impossible to preserve part of the open foundations and to access at least in a visually appropriate way.
In this direction, he could resume his efforts by the Minister of Culture Daniel Herman.
In the event that he is allowed by the government to purchase a mortgage for state money, it will only be another unfortunate step in his case that is already quite problematic in the role of the Minister of Culture.
Red mass, dairy products and chocolate may alleviate signs of infectious diseases (IBD)
For your heating system, you can have a red mass and milk products at night measured.
The new study, however, points to the correct contrast: the rich grass on animal protein and milk products could help relieve the symptoms of infectious diseases.
An incurable disease that affects up to 1.3 million U.S. citizens and 300,000 patients in Great Britain causes breast and blood clots, loss of weight and extreme sleep.
Patients are usually reminded that they do not use meat and milk products to calm down symptoms. However, researchers at Washington University found that essential amino acid triptofan contains protein helps to create immune cells that support lead resistance.
The leading study, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells protect the brain and ensure the recovery of harmful food germs.
The number of infectious cells is measured by the number of cells that support tolerance and body protection without harming the sensitive tissue.
As soon as the mice push you to the side of the infection, they can lead to an infectious disease.
Scientists have found that immune cells supporting body tolerance are present in the stomach of the muscle with a particular bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of triptofan - one of the building blocks of proteins.
Professor Colonna said: “We have found a connection between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuterire - which is a common part of medium microbiosis and development of cells that support body tolerance.
The more Triptophane had mice in their forests, the more they had these immune cells."
He also suggested that if it is shown that it is also paid for a person, then the combination of L. ureuteri bacteria and the rich on triptofane would help develop more sensitive and less sensitive media.
A postgraduate study by Dr. Luis Cervantes-Barraganwas, in the study of certain types of immune cells supporting body tolerance, revealed that one group of mice had these cells, while another group of the same mice treated by the unit of cells.
The result is that one group of mice has different metric microbiotics - a community of bacteria, viruses and fluids that usually survive in gastrointestinal tract.
The muscle fluid was tested by DNA sorting method and researchers found six types of bacteria in the muscle with immune cells that were processed by the second muscle group.
The mouse that was treated in the sterile environment and missed them by means of microbiosis - thus did not cause this kind of immune cells - was given to bacteria L. Reuters - and developed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers released L. reuters in liquid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without bacteria - into unexposed immune cells that were stored in isolation.
Immune cells developed into tolerance cells.
After the removal of the active ingredient from the liquid it was shown that the next product of triptofan metabolism known as indolyl-3-octane acid was present.
When researchers doubled the amount of triptofan in the wild muscle, the number of these cells increased by 50%. After the dose of triptofane was divided by half the number of cells.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance cells as mice and most of us keep bacteria L. reuter in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether subsequent products of triptofan from L. ureuter bacteria develop cells in humans in the same way as mice, but genetic defects related to triptofane have been detected in humans with infectious diseases.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Every one of us should most likely strive to develop these cells because they control the susceptibility of the internal surface.
Potentially high levels of triptofan in the presence of L. ureuter bacteria can increase the population of the bongue."
José Mourinh considers the signature of the contract with Neman Matic and his move to Manchester United for 'general'
Manchester United got into his "genia" team like Nemanja Matiće - at least that's what José Mourin thinks after what the founder started in the middle game against Sampdor.
Matić, who signed the contract for 40 million pounds, was introduced in the first game of victory 2:1 in Dublin - the last presidential meeting before UEFA, where the United meets on Tuesday with Real Madrid - and acted on his role as founder by Paul Pogby and Andrease Pereira.
However, since he did not participate in the team's Asian pre-session tour, Matić did not have a form and played only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinha's word, was to be worked before the beginning of the next season of Premier League.
"It takes time, but it's experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant thought - think football," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him get into the condition as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new players Victor Lindelöf and Romel Luka also played the first game at Aviva Stadium and Mourin's gradually starting to form their unit for the next season.
The independent source of this week announced that Mourin wants to continue to sign the contract with three other players, but it takes time for the club to take out " Fantastic work" and bring three of the most important players to the team.
"Thank the club for helping me get three out of four players," he added.
"Four of four would make me happier, but I admit that they've done the maximum for me."
The life challenge of the king of the chicken skin of Ládi Hrušky.
He wants lessons from Pohlrich!
This multifaceted picture began to unfold thanks to the new series on TV Prima Zdenönk's Academy.
The horska just blew up the chance.
"Dear Zdenjk, I would like to join your cooking academy because I think I can learn a lot from you," he called him in a video on the social network.
And because they've been spying for several years, Ládja has not forgotten to follow him this time.
"On the payroll I can teach you a sour diet, American chicken, or invite you to the water and show you why it's a favorite dried cheese," Hruška replied.
His participation in Pohlreich's new show really does mean.
It's time to think about higher levels and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss is about," said Bleska.
But he didn't express himself, because he'd picked up new parts of his next order Yes, boss!
Only Prima responded to Croatia's participation in the Culinary Academy by taking the whole matter as his personal activity outside television.
In December 2004, Hruška Pohlreichov set up his first cook.
In a few days, she sold over 300 thousand pieces!
The new order that Prima presented yesterday at a press conference to the underground transmission scheme is an unfathomable smoking school.
Pohlreich picks out his jackets from a series of fans and is known in twelve parts with twelve cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show, now the chief fires in November 2014 Zdeněk has let the cross-section hit the back of his trick.
If he had my face there, I'd be very ashamed.
"I'm just laughing at the rose - the rose is healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Ládía replied.
He thinks about Lád's culinary art.
"The fire according to Ládi Hrušky doesn't even come into mind at home, because I won't leave my house with a gastropunk," says the chief.
I'm very serious about Pohlreich's dress, even if he says I'm making chicken in the middle.
In my order, but his recipes will certainly not appear," Hruška refused to leave.
It's bullshit!
He's no cook for me. He's a TV club.
"Gastronomic analfabe or fat," Pohlrek said about Hrushk on one of his talks.
"I don't have twenty to be able to shake my hand over them, but I don't solve them any more," said Hruška's account.
The British researcher uses microchip in his hand to detonate the car and the home at dawn
The British researcher became the first person in the country with a microchip directed into the body. With his hands he can open the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam left a small chip to implant between his thumb and indicator and at the same time offers the same service through his BioTeq company to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, observes about the implementation and maintenance of treatment procedures.
Technology works on the same principle as microchip implanted by dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northamo's company also offers the service of exchange of doors and cars compatible with microchip. The price of one lock is 300 £.
A single child's father left technology to integrate into his home and his car BMW Z4, which starts with a simple hand-held hand.
The White House requisition is worth a thousand dollars.
The decision of the White House to fly by sea helicopter to South Lawn for the occasion of the American manufacturing industry's celebration last month came at $24,000 according to the weather records issued by the TIME Week.
Green White helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One in the presence of the president on deck, was the top program on 17 July in the White House, which was the review of American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and several high-ranking officials of the White House took a look at products from all 50 countries.
The helicopter from Connecticut was exposed to Maine's yachts, the train from Wisconsin, and the vehicle from Mississippi.
The military officer of the White House issued a fragmentary order or FRAGO and requested the presence of helicopters within 36 hours before the arrival of the helicopters in South Lawn under the "extraordinary" event, the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for the management of helicopters.
"I wanted to make sure you had information about such a significant event," wrote HMX-1 in his e-mail to his superior, the representative of the Air Force Commander on the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter will arrive at the South Lawn on 17 July about 7:00 on the occasion of a review, which is scheduled to begin at 15:00 and will remain on the site until the entire site is complete and planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
In the e-mail it was further stated that, if it comes to retirement from the White House, a remuneration will be sent for a return year due to the working time regulation.
The original team stayed this evening on the spot with the helicopter and with them a unit of security workers.
Of the records - which received the TIME week - it was not clear whether another team was finally sent.
The Hatch Act prohibits government officials from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible infringements of this Regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a Hatch Act violation and we were sure it was all right," the director wrote.
"It sounds like they're blocking you," said the representative of the director.
This view "Made in America" was marked by the White House as an official event and the Hatch Act would therefore not be applied to it.
But official events also have political subtexts.
On his part in the event, the president asked for a medical reform that was being carried out by the Senate and spoke about the efforts to maintain a government regulation.
The use of air transport facilities by Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is a challenge for the new phenomenon.
The presidents use them when travelling.
However, their presence is quite unusual for presenting reasons.
The Trump ordered control in the vicinity after the presidential plane had taken its first assembly in Melbourne to Florida. His Twitter account is subject to difficulties in using the presidential plane of his predecessor.
"The White House is pleased with the vision of ‘Made in America’, which presented products from all 50 countries producing American material,” stated the representative of the press secretary of Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopters often train landings in Washington and South Lawn and train appropriate opportunities with the president of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump participated in the G-20 group summit at the beginning of July in Germany, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercises in the White House.
The year of viewing Made in America was part of the current team trainer, the State manufacturer.
On the same day, the unit of helicopters landed within the "non-presidential support missions" for another eleven hours.
The White House indicated that no other records were taken from the money of tax collectors.
The Sikorsky speaker pointed out that the company was not in any way interested in the consultations on the South Lawn helicopter.
HMX-1 does not keep a record of the budget for the presidential year and the precise cost of the review is difficult to determine, according to the seafaring statement.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017 is the rate of the cost of the DoD for VH-3D 24,380 dollars per flight hour.
The records indicate 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of helicopters are significantly lower than that part.
"To impose the costs of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for the reimbursement of expenses is very impressive," Walters told the whole thing.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs, which are included in annual costs."
According to the 2015 RAND study, DoD costs do not include staff costs, but include fuel prices, maintenance and contractual costs.
The most difficult printing secretary of the White House Sean Spicer urged the use of helicopters for inspection purposes.
"The idea of a review which takes place this week is to present products produced in the United States," Spicer said.
"I am aware that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to the defence of our state and that they are giving work to hundreds of people, not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, we're proud of the helicopter and other military equipment, which divides the number of American citizens.
This fact is worth remembering."
It is not clear whether Trump was also seen on a helicopter at his way to South Lawn. It can only be said that he was seated as a volunteer of one of the Nazi vehicles.
Back in the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about its own fleet of products.
"I know the Sikorks very well," said the president, "I have three of my own."
A young woman got into a pool at the Macho lake, the police were aboard her.
The girl came out to the beach on Sunday at about two o'clock in the morning.
Instead of buying it, she remained trapped in milk.
When she decided to call the phone to help the police, she had the last 12 percent battery.
"That's why the police soon lost contact with her," reported police spokesman Ivan Balák.
In the place she described, several police officers appeared, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the police had to sail hundreds of meters of raccoon wetlands before they felt like a solid land," Balákova approached.
And she's been wrong about it.
The police were guided by the direction in which her call for help came from.
"In order not to come to this connection at least, they agreed with her that the voice would rest," said the speaker.
The police found the woman at three quarters on five in the bunker in the Borný area.
She was on the ground of physical and mental forces and took signs of understatement.
That's why the so-called Sanitary transferred her to the Chescolipse Hospital.
The Uncle's union with Stan?
She's a sales girl from the press.
It's a little irony.
In his web project searchable.cz like a billion voters would say that TAN is suffering from the lack of people to listen.
And he also argued that political parties are not even less aware of the concerns and independence of the party, in fact there is no national programme for filming elections.
Her volunteer candidate will only become an obedient person after he has a conversation with Grandpa, no matter what political opinion he has.
That's how Vit. Bart started this way, and it didn't work out.
In addition to his address to the audience and the personalities that are being rewarded on the candidates, some of the old ones, which has also been admitted by Gazdík, and the Grandfather also has a favorite argument of Chief STAN that the most valuable incentives are the political verification and experience of old age, traditionally the favorite policy, and according to research.
They are now peacefully exposing newly acquired unknown personalities.
The total deal with the people, after which Stan changed the logo and the slogan, Gazdík also explained that he does not want to lose his identity on the candidates.
But if TAN of identity had already suspected only a few, after Grandpa's arrival, he's finished and only game on identity.
Not only did Gazdík long limit himself against ANO Andrej Babish, at the first joint press, but Grandpa, who publicly praises Babishe, said: "My goal is to catch the ANO, then the old man gets twenty percent in the coming elections."
Let's hope he didn't take a bite.
Grandfather is a successful businessman and billionaire is certainly not a coincidence.
He often talks about politics like Babish, unlike him, but he doesn't have his own political sign.
STAN will remember for some time the reality of the show rather than the real political side and Grandpa's helping hand like she would do more to the sales girl from the news.
STAN went with TOP 09 for a while, then with people and now he's looking for decent people to change.
Let's hope someone calls.
Police dogs have been trained in the bridge by a helicopter
Dogs specializing in the search for explosives and patrolling dogs today have practiced at the lake Most of the flights by a helicopter.
The police dog should not be baseless and have fear of flying, said the leader of the police cynoologists of the Ustex country of Petr Tomášek.
Police dog training lasts two years.
In Mosta they used to practice dog training as adults, so those who practice first pass through.
According to the standard training they had to travel around the lake, hard samples of explosives and search for lost figure, all 12 animals had to climb into the crater and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test dogs in the spinal cord.
So as soon as he can, he can go to work with a dog so he doesn't have a problem with a road biker.
"The next knight, the dog goes and immediately seeks," Tomášek said.
A dog that is uncomfortable or is not able to start working right away is out of training.
"Then most people leave them on their own, for example, in the garden," Tomášek added.
The police have 76 dogs with various specialisations in the U.S. country.
They control German sheep, but they also come from Belgian sheep.
He's got a dog on him from the fence.
"He's training himself, preparing him for the service that the dog will do for us," Tomášek added.
The animal is subjected to repeated veterinary examinations that may detect any medical himdicacles.
If the dog is healthy and harmless, it will be tested for the first time in 20 months.
"It's about two and a half years old," Tomášek added.
The length of the police service depends on the health status of the dog.
Most of them serve for eight to ten years.
Then they live most of their dogs.
Trailer in the 3rd season of the Narcos: Pablo Escobar is outside the game and Cali Cartel becomes the middle-way Netflixu series
Despite the conclusion of the second season of Narcos, when the murder of Pablo Escobar was discovered, the Netflixo series is not over.
The confirmation by the Streaming Service was already pending the third and fourth season - the first named was already waiting for the first trailer and the creation of other restraints.
In the third season, DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four powerful engines, they operate “as a Fortune 500 company”, only by contrast, that they form violent acts and impose more of the government.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is a cartel leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (France Denis) plays the brain of the operation, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) has an old connection with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) rules New York.
In a new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, becoming a prolific American and Colombian lawbreaker in the fight against drugs.
Among the other priests are Mattias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Wheelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of the Narcos will wake up its prime minister on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy is dependent on women in politics
The elections may be likely only if all members of companies, including women, have been admitted to the centre of UN representation in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN Assistance Mission, said that the election to local representations is involving hundreds of women, three women are in the position of vice-president and more than 30% of new registered voters are women.
"The role of a woman cannot be overestimated," he said in his middle statement.
The elections can be fully representative and reliable only if they are involved with women as well as all the relevant processes associated with the elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April.
The Taliban has published a number of attacks on the electoral process, which goes beyond international fighting on the other side.
In this year's elections, one democratically elected government is first to hand over its power to the next government in peace.
Haysom pointed out that women's strong role is to strengthen the democracy of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission stated that of the total 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million women were created.
The unique beer again burns beer.
Good beer to the re-opened beer.
The excitement and enthusiasm of the new owners returned a few years ago to the life of the pivovar in Lobchi in Mšena.
Pivovar, mentioned earlier in 1586, has a renaissance core and has been stopped for parosing in the 19th century.
She was following the summer of the year when the beer was passed mainly by dark beer.
During World War II, the production of cotton was stopped and beer was born in 1984.
Since then, buildings have been serving the state ship.
The ban was made by the owners of the beer after 1989.
The abandoned area was destroyed and destroyed on construction materials.
In 2007, however, she gave birth to a new hope like the new owners, architects, Jan and Paul Prouzov.
These began to repair buildings with maximum respect for the spirit of the building and for every detail.
They have carefully dedicated themselves to studying archival materials, trying to keep the original materials and construction materials.
Pivovar has the same image as in the 19th century when he started his gold era.
Their work was assessed by the declaration of beer for the cultural memory of the Ministry of Culture and the construction became part of the European stages of industrial heritage.
In 2015, the tradition of beer burning was officially renewed.
If you want to taste the great blue beer in the small country of Kokorynska, visit the pool area.
When cooking beer here, they use Korean water that flows into the protected national area, milk from lobbying fields and ice cream.
In the exercise you enjoy traditional light beds, but also dark beer and specialties.
And don't take a look at the beer on Saturday and Sunday in the morning and in the afternoon.
Československa's biggest fire-fighting company?
One of the greatest strengths of your type in the world?
Such a unique building was to be the fortress of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Záclère, on the top of the terrain grave above the village of Babí.
It was originally to be made up of up to twelve sub-groups connected to a vast sub-area.
There should be leadership, cash, ammunition, materials, electricity, machinery and hospitals.
But the exhibition ended the Munich Agreement.
Within a few years, it was possible to establish the only possible railway station and the underground spaces were removed.
You can also see here, thanks to the supervisors from Stachelberg, who started building the unique building at the beginning of the 1990s.
The land is already available at 75 percent!
The area’s part is in addition to the T-S 73 windscreen with the exhibition and the ground and the equipped light-burning object, two additional scattered windscreens, ceilings and the scientific ladder of the T-S 73.
Cleaning, welding altar and beautiful views of the country guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has been found on the list of monuments such as the Great Chinese Wall, Traian's port in Rome or the Assyrian palace in Nineveh and Nimrudu.
The Chôtěšov monastery was originally founded from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which now forms the most possible four-circuit building convention on the beautiful garden.
The list he's got, but unfortunately, it's a unique building that's dangerous.
But the superiors don't want to give up and order a lot of actions to support the clauses.
One of them is the evening for the Kotěšov monastery this Saturday of the fifth August, where I will show up. Vladimír Misěk, Ivan Hlas, will see the Shermish exhibition and look at the beautiful scattered buildings that are usually unavailable.
But mostly you enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
Do you want to look at non-andractants in your face?
The exhibition Welcome to the neanderthals in the Pavilion of Anthropas Morovsk Land Museum in Brná lies on an unprecedented tour into the longest stone floor, in the world of our ancestors.
Find out how the neanderthals have been able to cope perfectly with the most diverse extreme weather conditions, mainly by mixing time with ice and ice.
And despite their simple material culture, they were constantly successful translators of their time.
You also learn how they looked like their anatomical, technological skills and hunting mind, but also their aesthetic feelings.
You wouldn't say that to non-andractants?
Don't convince yourself in Brne.
The 14th festival KELT & WorldLD MUSIC is held on Saturday Friday at the city of Vever.
In addition to great music you will see the construction of the cell universe, you will test the cell life - style of the brain, including the brain, for children and adults, for breeding, for magic or for ritual painting on the body.
There will be no lack of La Quadrilla with Irish and Scottish dances, bubonic jamming, game on hills and amazing fire surprises in the administration of Carpe Night.
How's Morravskossolski?
The 7th anniversary of the famous gastrofestival How Moravskoslesk is riding on Saturday 5 August 2017 in the area of the mountains of Karla Studánk.
The tour will be the chief Miroslav Kalina, enjoy culinary specialties and regional food, enjoy musical and dance performance, a rich program for children such as creative districts, theatre, climbing garden, Shmoulí competition road and of course a number of competitions.
Get to know the plant by one click.
Students with herbarian design and ordinary plant lovers will help new free Pl@ntNet application.
If they're going to be interested in which plant they just hit on the walkway, they'll be advised by this application.
The only thing they will have to do is photograph the plant and the application itself is aware of what kind it is.
The new application available to iOS and Android was presented in the afternoon as a representative of the Centre for Ethics and Environmental Training of CEEV in the Bratislavsk Hors Park under the project The City's Secret Life.
The project also started out with 50 Czech and Slovenian schools who photographed and added plants from their environment with teachers.
The newly created French app is free to download on the website The City's Secret Life.
The main goal of the French programmers was to contribute most people to the application of their photos, thereby increasing the number of plants that can be identified by the application.
"Children who hold a tablet or a cell phone in their hands can express themselves into the forest," said Ivana Poláčkova, coordinator of this project.
On the basis of sufficient quality photographs of flowers, leaves or plant fruit, the application will be able to recognize its name within a few seconds, which will then be arranged under the photograph in Czech and Slovenian.
The French allowed us to translate applications into Slovenian and Czech.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute a picture of plant that is not yet published in the database after the account is established.
"Francians agree whether it is profitable and then add it to the database," Polish reported.
About GMB investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The Committees require assurance from manufacturers of McVitie's long-term obligation to produce in a factory in Glasgow.
The Scottish Board of Governors of the GMB stated that the company would be silent as regards any investment in the Tollcross area.
He works in the factory for more than 500 employees who manufacture other than other products and Hobnob and Rich Tea.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis company, stated that over the last few years he has invested more than 5 million pounds in the whole area.
He added that employees and representatives of the committees will be "between the first informed" in case of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the construction company, the Scottish GMB Committee expressed its concern that McVitie's "will not be able to meet its commitments to finance and modernise production lines."
GMB Drew Duffy’s lead organizer added: “The fact that we have not received clear answers from the building manager regarding the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very disturbing for our members.
Many families and employees work here from the local community and the Glasgow area, where the work in the building industry represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social decision-making.
In view of the work, wages and benefits - and despite the view of Brexit, rising living costs and declining small production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs the prosperous producer, who is McVitie's."
A spokesman for Pladis said: “The resident Tollcross received a letter from the GMB first yesterday and the company publishes its first statement as we appreciate the continuing commitment to employees and representatives of the committees.
A regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago and a number of problems were discussed at this meeting.
We have talked to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we will assess our performance on a regular basis, which is paid for all our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
He added: “In recent years we have invested 5 million pounds in Tollcross, particularly in manufacturing lines and performance.
We highly appreciate the legacy of Tollcross and the more localities and, if any changes in the operation of the earlier factory, employees and representatives of the committees will be informed without delay."
She warned PSG Barcelona about the move of Neymar three years ago?
La Liga will be able to extend her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain does not allow its efforts to get Neymara on its side after what it made of 189 million £, so the amount needed to buy Neymara out of the contract, but warned this French team Barcelona about its record service three years ago?
This sensory move has opened the waters of summer crossings. Club League 1 is ready to transfer more than twice the previous record amount for Paul Gogby's move to Manchester United, which paid 89 million euros for him in the long season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and at least the most popular professional athlete in the world - after taxing the PSG team will take over £500,000 a week.
Barcelona is devastated by the way Neymar exported out of its contracts, despite the fact that a reliable source has confirmed that the club has always tried to treat Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But has the football world been warned of this fact three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in Blaise Matudih in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs that would be interested in overcoming one of the best players in PSG.
"I'm not afraid because when someone tries to get one of our players, then we'll certainly get one of their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the ideal limit when she expressed interest in PSG founder Marc Verratti in the summer.
The PSG made it clear in this sense that under no circumstances does not allow the departure of the Italian representative. Therefore, it is possible that Barcelona, for her trophal treatment now with the departure of Neymara, is a hot pill.
Who's gonna explain the penalty?
Does political persecution have a broad understanding of rules?
Donald Trump was missing the anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier in the United States, sanctions had been imposed on Venezuelan President Madura.
And yet another day, Trump wrote that China is not doing anything with North Korea's threat and that it's still not going.
And from that, the idea of punishment is like a piece of paper.
These things can't get into one of the pits.
Madurova Venezuela really went on its way to the dictatorship, but completely.
China just doesn't act like an American president.
Russia is a capital for itself.
But if someone wanted to gather it all so that even a common voter, American, European or other, understood what he was beginning and what system he was dealing with, that would be almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump only provides what President Obama has already found, but only has given the executive mandate.
So why such a mess?
Loni feared that if the American elections were to win the Trump, we would join Putin and call for sanctions.
That's a terrible idea.
But it's the wrong thing to do.
The trupes don't release them, but they do.
But Europe is afraid more.
German Minister Zypries says that the Trump sanctions violate international law.
It's like the coach is just fines approved by the UN Security Council?
Then there are no EU anti-virus sanctions.
The Head of the European Commission, Juncker, once again complains that the Trump sanctions threaten EU energy security.
It's like they're supposed to use sanctions just so they don't threaten anyone?
A typical typewriter.
For three years, it has been heard that the judgments of the anti-Russian sanctions will depend only on the fulfilment of the minority agreements applicable to Ukraine.
It is now found that it is about EU energy security.
The love of tapes and broader.
In Russia, sanctions are coming because it's too high where it doesn't.
China's tired of mounting a little.
The Venezuelan president is sentenced to a dictatorship within his country.
All these punishments or only concerns have their rationality.
But does anyone see in that system, right or rule?
Andrej Babish: I don't consider working with Okamura.
Andrej Babish got married, he's covering the Republic with his vision book and he's finalizing the election program.
In addition to Pardubic's country, he's already got all ready candidates.
According to his own words, he did not get very angry at them.
He even agreed to lead a member of the ANO Ivo Vondrak School in Moravaskoslesk.
"If he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a Messenger or a Heitman," Babish confirmed his previous opinion.
As a whole, you've been angry about the fact that citizens and cities should be run by managers directly.
Do you really think so?
It wasn't like that.
I'm a direct advocate of democracy, we love the President, and I'm convinced that we should also love the elderly and the prime minister.
I'm not talking in my book about the destruction of agents. They can be there.
It's a question of how many of them will be.
In presenting your book on what I dream when I'm sleeping, I heard on my own ears that you were talking about breaking up representations.
You don't remember that.
I was talking about the direct vote and the reduction of the number of representatives.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the receiver says she's a little busy and doesn't prepare big projects, but she doesn't have any competence for that.
It also pays for the government that only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
I'm not saying they did good.
The current prime minister, but he's not doing anything, he's just slowing down the debate.
So it can't work.
That's why you're going to run a majority system?
It'd be perfect, but it's hard to do.
In the programme, we only have a change to the single election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a closed mandate of Ministers and the reform of the Single Act order to prevent the remaining exhibitors who are to work mainly on committees and committees, from attending the meetings of the Senate.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
That's exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator you will run the government, check the deal with 101 Members, cancel the country and Senate, and rule the whole country through gratitude and gratitude.
Well, it's definitely not.
There is nothing wrong with discussing the number of Members.
The French President Macron announced a reduction in the third legislative assembly, while there are 57 thousand French lawmakers, while we have 17 thousand Czechs.
Still no one blames Macrona for threatening democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won most of the elections, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making some dramatic changes.
The courts for those who have a majority of parliaments are big enough to look into Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like this is at risk in the case of UN attack.
We just need a team that will work in the government for people, not for their parties or resorts.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree that there's only growing fees for teachers, cultural workers and social services.
Why did they vote for me and add 21 per cent of GIBS personnel who are already taking 60,000?
Would you like to join us as prime minister?
The Prime Minister will be surprised when ministers behave economically, they run away from the government with travel offices and, for the money of the state, they would like to run like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and in South Africa.
The government's ministers are not supposed to argue, the opposition is supposed to be out of it.
The office has to go to a prepared material, which has no place for coalification, strong vote and headphones, there has to be a decision.
How do you want to have a supportive team when ministers act mainly on the sidelines?
There's a constitutional law on the sides.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the Coalition Treaty would not be paid, and he expelled Babishe from the government.
This can be done by any prime minister.
But if there is a personality and a management capacity, a similar gesture plan will not be needed.
It measures everything the same and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you'd propose to the Minister of Finance?
I don't even think about it, because we're not even going to be in that government, and no one wants to work with us, even though I don't know what I've done so terrible.
There's not so much scissors on the spot.
The older ones have won the company Grandfather who would like to work with you. People may win you the wing of your dedicated Jiři čunka.
I don't think so.
ČSSD leads Lubomír Zaorálek, which does not exclude the coalition with ANO, in the ODS it may be transferred to Václav Klaus ml.
I'd leave it on the streets.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President of UNO Richard Brabec said you have many common points with SPD Tomio Okamuri, for example in the field of economics.
So the Ocamurians are taking into account as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he's running as a VV-Vita Barty Lieutenant, then he's got money from the University for his company, he's been there for a while.
Of course he is an outstanding character.
She's kind of intruding somewhere.
When I take his programme, there is a broad involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, which can be agreed upon.
I don't even ask you that.
I wonder if there's a friendly person who has xenophobic views on demonstrations with elephants and wants to come out of the EU?
We don't consider co-operation with Mr. Okamura, I can't imagine.
It's obvious he went to politics to benefit from it.
And what's the silent support of the Communists from your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but I'm a determined lover.
It's about winning with each other in order, but God knows who's winning and who's winning.
Of course, it is important for them to be able to negotiate with the Coalition Government programme.
Let's go back to your efforts to be a company.
But the government just has to rule, Prime Minister Sobotka has to let everything go, he has never decided.
Coalities such as CEB or EGP did not work.
The Sobotka is his nephew, and that's what I think is why he threw me out.
As soon as he did, Chez ruled the Czech government.
It is, however, unbelievable that the Prime Minister has brought a report written by the ČEZ management, which governs the finance ministers as to how to vote on the ČEZ flagship.
If you become a prime minister, will you change your personal weight in the Board of Supervisors and change your superior management ČEZ?
Jesus Christ, if I'm a prime minister, I'll see you.
I'm not here yet.
It's a shock that the Chez has already sent signals to your direction.
Good cooperation with the ČSSD would like to exchange more and better with the UN.
So maybe after the elections, everything's going on.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have any Lobster of Pokorni or Rozíčk, I'm an independent unit, and I don't even solve this.
So answer me directly.
If you become head of the government, will you try to change the management of ČEZ, Czech TV or General Health Insurance, then the institutions that criticize you?
I'd like Chez to be a transparent company.
He's been doing what he wanted all these years, and I've been providing it for traditional political parties.
It's enough to check out Mr. Schwarzenberg's products.
Although he has to be in the ČEZ Majority, he never ordered it, he was only there to count it, which is wrong.
It's a criminal matter for me.
THE DEKOVANY should take them, evaluate them, run them into a subsidiary, arrange funding, make an additional competition or get a co-investor and set up a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state has to finance and put new nuclear blocks is absurd.
What about Czech TV?
Some of her orders against me are holding a permanent target campaign, but I don't and I won't have any competence to challenge someone.
But to control it.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that the public payment for public law and television is worth 7.2 billion dollars a year, but they don't really know how these economic institutions are.
How does he not know?
On the other hand, the Commission shall adopt a report on their management, which shall have a direct impact on the positions of the Heads of State and of the Czech Republic.
Look at how these messages are being delivered, on the super power pact Sobotka Diosek, which has always worked.
It pays both for the current parliamentary committee for the students of the research papers, as well as for the Lex Babish.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let me pressure God out of the government, which won the percent of TOP 09, but the ČSSD took it.
They're afraid of violating their corrupt system, and they're talking about threatening Babish democracy.
No one's immune.
What do you say to the members who describe how the first Vice-President of UNO Jaroslav Faltýnik builds a strong commitment by bringing his son to the supervision of the Tekláren Brno Council and arranging for an agreement with the local and state companies, such as the Prague transport company or the Czech road?
That's where we have a permanent dispute.
I don't like it, and I read it to him several times.
Faltin argues that the abovementioned lawyer works for a substantial lower rate and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As a finance minister, I had no one.
We're, unlike soybeans, never had a corrupt affair, no Pelt, no Kratochville, no Bridge.
If we had any evidence of customerism, we'd just let such a man go.
I am not compromised in this direction.
If something like this happens, we're gonna get rid of anyone, it's totally the same who it is.
