When he called, the professor admitted that he shot his friend.
During the call to the emergency line, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he had shot his friend and that it was necessary for them to come home.
Lamb assumed that his "dry dog" was alive at home and probably broken up and that contacts with a dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside the police found Amy Prentiss' body and manually wrote a note on the white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could bring it back, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," stood in a letter signed by Lamb.
There was no doubt that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would be 300 miles to school campus where the police are thought to have shot his favorite Professor Ethan Schmidt at his office door.
The chief of police at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
The Lamb first made a sad phone on the emergency line shortly thereafter.
At last another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting at school, the students and the college were given to hide behind closed doors, and the trusted authorities were still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
Details published by researchers on the part of the state and students and employees who knew him jointly created an image of a talented but probably a problem teacher.
The students confirmed that they enjoyed his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no record in the criminal register or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in his book, which he wrote, in thanks to "the great people," with which he shared academic life.
Both attended the School of Social Sciences and history together with the other 17 members of the faculty, and many students attended courses at the same time.
At the same time, inclinations have emerged when it comes to problems.
A student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said that he also seemed angry and confused, "like there was nothing wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said Lamb told him that he was suffering from stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had already asked Delta State University for free medical reasons when he said he had a problem.
And this year he only studied two online courses.
Recent changes in the level of university staff meant that a doctor whose work Lamb insisted would not guarantee him an automatic functional period to become an assistant professor.
The president of the University of William LaForge said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamba must have suffered something."
We're not answering these questions anymore, Lamb.
After he left the campus, the police seized his foot when he crossed the borders of the state of Arkansas back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a gun gun at the courthouse about a mile from his parents at Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed the Crown of Washington, Methel Johnson.
He left the car on the street.
It wasn't clear immediately why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew people who lived here.
The lamb grew up in this country.
Lamb started working at a university that has 3500 students in the city, which is about 12000 citizens, in 2009, and taught agriculture and education hours.
He's got a doctor at school on his knees.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20, when she met with friends.
She was with her friends at high school and he was the great older boy who taught her to play guitar for years.
He was a pretty heart attacker at the time.
The heart of all the girls grew up when he appeared," says Hayrston, who is now 40 years old and lives on Jackson's estate.
Lamb and Prentiss probably walked together for some time.
During the emergency phone, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a cyclist house near the shore of the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was okay.
Former husband Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely upset," said O'Steen about her daughter.
She was the best friend she ever had with her mother.
About Stein said he didn't meet Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were at the annual festival three years ago.
Later, they played suitably gays together.
About Stein said his daughter writes and sings her own song.
Prentiss was a healthy sister who worked for different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barman and an alternative entertainment coordinator in The Jule Room, argued a light bar near Gautier, said that last night he saw Lamba and Prentiss on September 5th, a path that Lamb had gained on guitar and harmony for countless taxes.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a couple of happy ones," he said.
We used to make fun of each other for jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murder professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialized in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, professor of English at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the president of a boy student club and student government.
In the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including members of the faculty, employees, students and members of the community, participated in the memorial action with candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also participated in the guard, during which the university congregation called "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
She started school again in the middle of the night.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge says.
The crisis is for us.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported to Cleveland, Mississippi.
Authors for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story was designed to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a phone call on the emergency line after Schmidt was killed, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were really dating.
Toys R Us plans to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us says they don't get as many seasonal workers as they did last year, but the producer of children's toys and products says it gives the current employees and seasonal workers the chance to work more hours.
The company also indicated that it is planning to hire about 40,000 employees to work in businesses and distribution centres throughout the country, which is a decline of 45,000 last season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company declares it will start with a set of indicators this month, and the employee will be collected by October to December.
While holidays themselves are far away, the shopping holiday season is close and companies are ready to take up temporary employment for aid in trade and sales, for the delivery and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "rande" with Princess Diana
Prime Minister "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Foxe.
She was also upset for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I found that Princess Diana would sit there," said in the trailer for the next document, "Back in time."
The movie starts and I'm getting enough of something that could be called a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Back in time," is a document on "Back to the Future," which mentions talks with Foxe, Lee Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
Prime Minister "Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's really the best travel document ever filmed for me."
"Back in time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there's no military solution in Syria
General Secretary Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russian rapid military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict almost five years of conflict and more weapons are only increasing violence and suffering millions of people.
The Head of the UN has repeatedly called upon all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support an inclusive policy solution.
Ban said at the mid-term press conference that it is planned to meet with the foreign ministers of five permanent councils of the countries - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the end of the ministerial meeting of the Valne Assembly at the end of this month due to the situation in Syria.
He expressed his policy that the division in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "has made this situation unsolved."
Ban has chosen five permanent members to show solidarity and units that have shown themselves to be in the process of achieving Iran's nuclear agreement in resolving the crisis in Syria.
8 optional numbers showing that Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to make him look like a person who often changes his mind.
The rest of them had their hands like an unexplained joke.
And some are getting ready for the imploding.
But if some Republicans are already trying to get Donald Trump down from the top of the street, they won't be able to do it (yet).
10 of the last 11 national studies show that Donald Trump is in charge of a double-digit number, and some people are starting to wonder seriously what this means for the nominal chance of this magnet in the property area.
Of course, it's just the beginning of a popular cycle.
None of this says that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry made his way to Herman Caino's entrance, at last not one of them won the only position in the nominee process.
There are many reasons why he could get caught in general elections.
But outside groups such as Super PAC Fucker Bush and the economic conservation team Club for Growth will inform Trump of their desire to maintain and start spending their dollars on a stand with a view to putting it together.
Here are some recent voting numbers that indicate that the actual magnet is not just a border phase:
The dumping margin was reduced by 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidate in half of June, the Montmouth University vote showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of this real magnet.
It was 40 percent already in half of July.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 per cent.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a reputation for Donald Trump.
Three out of ten people say they have a negative view of him.
And this number is kept in the initial stages.
After the Universities of Quinnipiac last week, it was found that 60 per cent of the Republicans had a positive opinion on the Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would be at peace with Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of Republicans indicated that they would be either "relief" or "peace" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 indicated that they would be "distorted" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates the noise at the same level of over-exploitation as Trump (43% of the people said they would be "inflated" against 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next closest to the top level?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republican voters say they would be "unsatisfied" or "dissolved" if they preferred Jeb Bush as a candidate.
Most Republicans do not see Trump's temperature as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticised for his irritability and injuries, 52 per cent of Republican voters are generally convinced that the actual magnet has the right temperature for the president's post, according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll.
The same number is held at the State Senatorial Club of Iowa, which is the first in the country where 52 per cent of Republicans think they have a leader, according to Quinnipiac since last week.
However, 44 per cent feel that he does not have a personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 out of 10 independents say his temperature does not belong to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are accustomed to this idea.
When they set up their student clubs, the Republican voters think that Trump is a real candidate.
On the question of who, with the highest probability of winning the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC study last week.
It's a change from the late July when four out of 10 got their money on fucking Bush.
Complete publication: GOP lovers did not in the past have the most famous Christian kiss.
At this time in the past cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as a candidate against 28 per cent for the possible appointment of Mita Romney.
However, it is shown that a certain number of GOP voters see the Trump campaign as credible.
Although the Republicans gathered around another candidate, the Trump also beats almost everyone.
Some students point out that the dissolved field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Turpov's support is diffusively spread among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a study by Monmouth University from the beginning shows that in a hypothetical direct file between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will receive almost always majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorin on 13 points, Marc Rubie on 14 points, Walker on 15 points, Fucking Busham on 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christ on 33 points in each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead a merchant of 19 broad points in a hypothetical match against one another.
A large majority of Donald Trump's staff claim they've already taken their own view.
A new CBS/NYT afternoon survey shows that only over half of the voters supporting the troops claim that their views are no longer changing.
It's obvious that many things can change, and no one can really say that he would never change his opinion.
46 per cent say they're leaving an open rear door to change between candidates.
Although Trump’s current most powerful opponent is his external neurosurgery colleague Ben Carson, the voters who consider their final opinion to be twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans are likely to agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Even since the time Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "the rapists" in his campaign's advertising campaign, migration has continued to be the main and central theme of the 2016 conference.
Some fear that trumpet blasts from the Republic's key Spanish voters and the damage of the rebranding force.
However, according to the new ABC/Post public poll, six out of 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that while the issue of immigration remains in the backyard of the reflectors, Donald Trump will remain as well.
Frustration from the government is reaching new maximums.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive half of the support from Republican voters, particularly in view of their status as external voters.
Six out of 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post new Monday vote say they want more political outsiders than anyone with government experience.
And they're also very upset at Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg vote in Io'a a few weeks ago went off that three of the four Republicans in Io'a were frustrated by the Congress, 54 per cent were "unsatisfied" and 21 per cent "oppressed."
The measure supported most of the State's coal payments.
Chechnya gets more than 400 million.
The first reading series supported the government's new higher law, which manages the high cost of fees from the surface weight of coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mlaek (ČSSD) promised the Members that they would earn more money than the state fund, so the citizens' budgets would be.
The proposal was criticised by the opposition's messengers who were afraid that tax firms would no longer want to sponsor the city as yet because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The first reading supported the government's new higher law, which means that the state should receive more of the cost of taxes on the surface of coal from tax companies.
The state share increases by 67 per cent, while the urban share decreases by 75 per cent by 33 per cent.
The proposal also changes the method of calculating the remuneration for non-increasing enterprises.
The change in non-increasing payments will result in a state deficit of 427 million more than in 2013.
As a result of the municipal budget, the government has a neutral impact because the fee has to be higher.
In the previous year, citizens received a total of 450 million dollars and a national budget of 150 million dollars.
From the heavy demand for coal came about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns for the state.
The novel is also calculated by increasing the reward from the winning room with a allowed weight of 1000 kroner per hectare per year.
Acceptance of these grants will continue to be a full-scale citizen.
Minister of Industry Jan Mádek (ČSSD) told the delegates that the cities are getting instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns annually.
The higher tax rates will no longer be determined by the law but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The award shall be re-calculated as a percentage of the amount of the outstanding growth and the rates for individual types of non-increased growth.
According to the government, there is a reason for changes beyond the possibility of a positive response to the current economic situation.
Ambassador ODS Marek Banda, however, warned that the establishment of a fee under the government regulation should not be in accordance with the statute.
According to Minister Mádka, however, there is no tax in this case because the state pays off the state's state-owned state-owned growth.
Payments are made only by citizens whose territories are seriously affected.
In the case of deep difficulties, the coal will receive three quarters of the city’s money and a quarter of its state.
The same will be true in the case of radioactivity hormones.
The amount of money to be paid out of the difficulties will be effectively linked.
For example, 28 per cent will have to be repaired after pregnancy or for the purpose of providing banking services.
The proposal was criticised by opposition envoys who claimed, in particular, that it was harmful to the affected population and the country.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starostov) warned that tax firms would no longer want to sponsor citizens as yet because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve your budget by the Minister of Finance," said David Kádner (Suscit) who was elected in the Eastern country.
KSCHM Hana Aulikká warned against increasing unemployment in Moscow.
Kaddner and Aulikka failed to propose a new refusal, Kuchera wanted to return the law to the government for processing.
According to the original report, the increase in prices in coal prices is not mentioned in the company's tax company, as prices are from more than 90 per cent long term.
The main consumers as electricity or heat should therefore not feel the rising price.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that tax organizations will compensate for the increase in the budget for the effort to reduce their operating costs, which would in particular mean reducing the number of employees," the government said.
However, it argues that the increase in employment costs is inevitable.
According to the New Milan Urban (ČSSD) report, it is crucial that the Members should know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and mainly the government's decision on the limits of coal.
If the coal is to be weighed beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on the benefits for the state and the public, it will highlight.
The City does not agree with Mádk that the decision to break the threshold at the bottom of the Czechoslovakian Army should fall by 2020.
The thresholds below ČSA should be broken by reason of social, national economic and long-term stability of telecommunications.
Chechnya's happy behavior as a unit, setting up an influence time.
All four common tennis stars will appear during the fourth blast of Davis's flag in India on the table and this time each of them will most likely be caught in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrātil plans that, given the difficult conditions, he will deal with the burden on the entire neighborhood.
In Dilli, the air temperature and high humidity are expected to rise to up to five seats.
We've got to take it to the pool.
I'd like to spread it over time.
And according to what it's going to look like, Navrátil said at today's Czech election coach at the center of Rajja Kumár Khanny.
With a single team and the world's four-year-old Jiři Wesel is counted to five and a half weeks.
As a couple, Lukaš Rosol and Radek Štépanek are likely to be affected.
I'd like them to start almost everyone.
I've got it in my head, but before I say it, the captain said it.
Another security in the Czech regime should be the participation of Štépank in Saturday.
It's just a question who's standing next to an experienced delilist who's in David's custody in four balance sheets 18:4.
It's probably not gonna be happy.
There are other options with Rosa or Adam Pavlás.
"I really don't know who and how it will look," said Narrātil.
It is determined by the development of two.
The variant can be Pavlásek, surprised by the joy of winning in the first round over Australia.
"He's in a deep mood," he said.
I was told against Australia, and when I'm playing, I'd like to show you the same performance I've shown from the second set.
"I like those experiences and I'd like to bring the point," said Pavlás.
The home is located in two Yuki Bhambri (125. in the ATP cell), which won last week's challenger in Shanghai, where he won third and fourth percent of the cellphone players.
The two will be Somdev Devvarman (164.).
Both are players from the Challengers and we have experience from ATP Tour, but we've been convinced many times that the jellyfish in Davis are not going to decide.
"It decides the current form, the time," said Navrātil.
The five initial doubles begin at 6:30 SELČ and can be picked up for time.
According to the prophecy, he's got his chest and his chest isn't under the roof.
However, the game may be for artificial lighting.
They've already made it, and it's got a couple of thousand luxes, which is enough.
"You should be able to play it under the light," said Narrātil.
Jeremy Corbyn will start at Prime Minister's Questions
From your choice, Mr. Corbina's debutment in PMQ is very highly expected
New staff leader Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut in Prime Minister's Questions later, and he will have to work with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn is the first of his six assigned questions shortly after Monday, while his performance is likely to be carefully examined by the media and the Members.
In a week's statement, he asked "less theatre and more facts."
He also indicated that he could skip a few meetings that he would leave with his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership, which will come after his appointment to the shadow office and his opening remarks to the TUC Annual Congress.
In the meantime, the decision of the lab leader to remain silent during the national hymns in service on Tuesday for the 75th anniversary of the battle against Britain met with criticism from a number of conservative MPs and focused on a number of stories on the headlines.
Mr Corbina's decision not to sing national hymns attracted attention
Mr. Corbyna spoke that he would "stand in silence" and that he would recognize "the dignity of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of Mr Corbyna's shadow office, Owen Smith, announced the BBC Two's Newsnight programme that the laboratory leader would recommend the national hymn "no matter" to his conviction that the monarchy should be cancelled.
Almost a thousand shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Corbin's team, quoted economic differences, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than six parliamentary parties originally supported him as a leader.
Political Correspondent BBC Robin Brant says that political differences in employment are also "founded" after Mr Corbin's appointment over his position in the European Union and the government tax limit.
Mr Corbyl pointed out at the TUC conference that the Spartan Party had submitted amended proposals to remove the whole idea of a dose limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, a shadow worker and pensioner, said that the party "very clearly" repeated government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Head of the Party, headed by David Cameron for the last decade from his election as head of the Conservatives.
The leader of the business party, who has promised a different approach to politics, claims that he has "from the tax" ideas on questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that PMQs are too confrontational and that they remain as "responsive answers," both of the so-called trade, and instead promises that they will focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn says that Angela Eagle, a shadow trade secret, will represent him in PMQ if he is not involved — for example when Mr. Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also left the idea that he would allow other colleagues to appear for him from time to time, because he was allowed to hear that he was still discussing the whole matter with the speaker John Berkow.
When Mr. Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to reject the style of the policy "Punch and Judy," which was often linked to PMQ, but a few years later he admitted that he was down.
Since its first mission in 1990, PMQ has been seen as the key barometer of the judge of leaders, their leadership and their position among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become caricatures and need remote reforms.
"Focation in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
Johannesburg is a hard place for homelessness.
But one group of former street children found a way to learn something and make a living.
"I was focused on Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to make photographs of their neighbors and make such money.
The BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

Libra stands, while the increase in payments in Great Britain speeds up
Libra jumped the following date and showed the rise in the British med growth, while FTSE 100 was led up by the SABMiller offer objective.
Between the flower and the red win of the GB, including bonuses, stood at 2.9% compared with the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009, and it seemed as if the dates were approaching when the rates were high.
Sterling stood more than 1% against the dollar for $1.5505 and was 0.84% above against the euro for €1.3730.
FTSE 100 index closed at 149% k 6,229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional market share and increased by 20% after he got the approach from his AB InBev rival.
The agreement would combine two of the world's biggest beads, and the approaching sign is Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were about 0.9% higher after encouraging reports from the Rival of the luxury product Richemont.
The latest sales results of Richemont are all expected and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, began to re-enter.
The share in Glencore rose by 5% after the tax giant said they stood for $2.5bn by sharing location as part of the debt reduction strategy.
The share in the battle and paper group Mondi was the biggest drop on the index and closed by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs reduced his rating to the company on "sale."
JD Sports stood at 3.1% after the sport company announced 83% jump in half a year in profits before tax £46.6m
Chief JD Sports says higher odds could damage expansion
The Executive President of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that a higher minimum wage for workers in the United Kingdom could mean "more purchasing power in potential consumers' pockets."
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would carry higher tax costs in his company, he says.
The costs could include plans for the expansion of JD Sports, which could mean less new jobs.
The defenses of Prague's battleships are flying.
Controversial building got a step.
Investor Praga Projecti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be contradictory and will appeal against it.
Against the building that is to occur in the close proximity of the Anesian monastery in the center of Prague, there were protests in front of the Prague office of 1 percent of the people, and there were also petitions.
The Master of the Decision found that the construction law had been breached because not all of the requirements of the Land Decision were met.
"The relevant territorial decision does not include, for example, certain types of land, distance from neighboring buildings, sufficiently clearly and understandablely described building structure, limiting the land affected by the impact of the building," he wrote in his decision.
It is also considered illegal by the Master that certain grounds for decision were issued to the original document which was changed.
For example, it concerns the position of the living environment authorities.
The part of the building is to be built on the ground National Gallery, but the investor has no valid agreement.
According to the written material, however, the owner of the land has submitted only agreement with the project documentation for land management, not with the establishment of buildings on his land, the building committee writes.
According to Francesca Augusta Razetta from the investment firm, the Committee of the Construction Board did not take into account the decision of the Authority - the Ministry for Local Development which had already taken place.
Anyway, it's about the scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for 17 years, upholding all the laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto stated in a press report.
The project that people are looking at because of the well-designed color phases of the marshmelone is causing a strong emotion in Prague.
In the center of the city, hundreds of people have met in the past to protest against construction.
Associations and residents of neighboring homes are concerned that a certain permit was issued years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticise the disparity of buildings for the historical center of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Anjesk monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Frank, and the project changed several times.
The original version of the 2008 project, which was calculated by the original phase, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture (NPU) on the basis of the Views of the National Memorial (NPU), and rejected the approval of the Prague Memorial in 2010.
The new project of Prague Projecti e Investimenti with face-to-face windows but NPU and master memory were approved and a building permit was issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the waste of solvents, before never counting the phase in pink, which gave the project a review after pink sugar.
The Czech policy has brought down migrants.
The Magyars took him to the base with them.
Berg went to Hungary with the aim of bringing humanitarian aid to refugees.
On his way, he took a crew into a car with three Syrian refugees who wanted to drive about six miles [half km] away.
He said it wasn't criminal in Hungary at the time, he said to the Lid's newspaper.
We knew the law guards didn't act like this.
But when the police stopped us, arrested us to our surprise and transferred us to the Szeged investigation unit, he wrote a letter.
At last, the policy lasted nine hours.
The police did the right thing, but they kept in touch because they didn't know English too well.
But he said it was sad.
For example, in our overall dimensions, about three times four meters were pushed 15 refugees from Syria.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were already locked up on the second day, and because of language barriers, none of them wondered what was going to happen to them.
What can't we have fun anymore?
Ask the Presidents of the Executive Chamber.
On Friday 18.9. from 9:30 p.m., the President of the Executive Chamber of ČR Mgr. Pavla Fuchíkov will answer the questions.
You can ask her about changes to the executive law applicable from 1 September 2015 and other matters related to executives or executives.
Metcash is launching a campaign outside to fight invasion Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA business from Aldi's efforts in southern and western Australia.
Metcash is launching a campaign outside to fight invasion Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 shops in southern and western Australia at the beginning of the next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and create the sign IGA through marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers add signs such as the Simmo's ice creamer based on Dunsborough offers discounts in IGA shops and the owners of the store sell counterfeit lists on the Australian football league to local customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29, when food, alcohol and hardware vendors celebrate their annual investment strategy day.
There are many in the market because southern and western Australia represents nearly 30 per cent of Metcash IGA business steps and generates higher business than Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notorically provincial and IGA trades enjoy much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared to around 14 per cent in the Eastern States.
Anyway, analyst Morgan Stanley believes that Aldi will benefit from 5 per cent of the food market in these two states during the 12th month since the opening of the first trades that took over markets from all existing players but mainly independent retailers.
This week in his report analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA retail could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This proposal is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in southern Australia and 30 in the western part of the next year and will generate sales of US$ 500 and 600 million on individual markets.
The cost of food sales and volume in a solid Metcash price base could be estimated at around $13 million on pre-taxed income, Mr Kierath confirmed.
Meanwhile, Metcash lost part of markets in the eastern states, mainly against Aldi and Coles, despite the latest investigation of Roy Morgan found that the purchasers in IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that the sales of Metcash food will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week the manager of the Hamish Douglas fund, founder of the Magellan financial group, said that business meals in Melbourne could "be very likely to disappear during the decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglas's comment.
But it is known that a member of the Metcash presentation contacted Douglas last week.
The IGA market share ended from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and Metcash food business training, which provides about 1200 retail IGA , dropped by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of speculative changes, as sales and outputs are under pressure.
However, large-scale trade has gone into the pipeline and invests more than US$ 150 million annually in order to balance the wholesale prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week and thus helps IGA small businesses to re-equipped businesses by adding fast-growing food and paper from private customers.
Executive Director Metcash, Ian Morrice, says that the price adjustment and supply programmes will catch sleep and hope that the wholesale will return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Steve Healthy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more honor than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become more lost in recent encounters with his friend Nick Kyrgiose and deserves more praise than criticism, says President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the talented two often called "Special Ks," took undue attention by means of an affair with an unexplained Cyrgyus and Stan Wawrinka at Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in his high-qualification interview at Cincinnati, Kokinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by a decision, Harrison then declared: "Wawrinka had one to pull up Kyrgyos and I had to pull him up too."
While he last saw how they broke the rocket after the scream hit him with Richard Gasquet's possible release on US Open, Kokinakis suddenly called Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he is against Sam Grothem on his second floor for Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup in the British semifinal.
"I've been thinking intensely about the fact that Thanasi was a little pregnant in the whole dispute," says Healy.
He lost himself when he lost his rocket because of a scream in the U.S. but he's not the first player to kill himself because of frustration on his own. I know Thanasi's pretty good and I can say that this event won't be proud.
But he really did well because he was exposed to a very provocative environment in the US because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves great recognition.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated some hard.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and he's in the team well and so far, never had a problem with other players, he's very respected, he's hard, he's in a wonderful condition, he's a very stable and successful young man, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own standards.
Healy also supported the decision to review Kyrgyos for the important game that begins on Friday, stating that "interchange of decisions" is the right solution for all but supports Canberry's family to return to the team as a long-term chair.
"First of all, we want our team to be focused on the game and not on all the controversy around it [Kyrgyos]," says Healy.
And I think Nick's standing very fast as Federerer, Murray and others show, in public eyes, he's also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time beyond the explanation when he can think about it, it's my best solution for the team and for him alone.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency status, closes borders and maintains migrants
Following notification of the situation of the threat of Hungary in the morning, the southern border with Serbia closed and those who tried to break it so as to stop the flow of migrants.
There was chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants gathered in the country of no one and the Serbian authorities reacted badly.
Those who have spent an unknown time in the sands of the land between the two states are those who flee before the violence in their homelands, who are in a state of state and live.
But there's a sense of frustration.
When helicopters pass them, migrants call together "Open Borders!" and offer a regular unit of Hungarian police.
Some reject food and water at the protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declares that it was "unacceptable" to send refugees back from Hungary, while they are increasingly coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbian) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect involvement.
It will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries during the next days," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The concerns at the Hungarian-Serbian border came the day after the 28-State block didn't come with a single immigration policy at further meetings in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece and spoke with the hope of reaching an agreement next month or at the end of the year, which would have taken over 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
Germany's Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Rakousko called for a special European summit next week to discuss the continental crisis.
However, Hungary did not trust Brussels or its neighbors.
The internal threat situation in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater power to resolve the crisis and allowed them to close the roads and speed up judicial cases of asylum delivery.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a fleet from the other side of the border with Romania to stop refugees who are trying to cross their country when the fleet is now completed on the Serbian border.
CBS News co-component Charlie D’Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped to draw the rest of the route between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months Hungary has become the main weakest and entry point in the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled from Syria and other Middle East countries.
However, the President of the government, Viktor Orban, pointed out that most of them are economic migrants who are going for a better life and not war refugees who are seeking protection, which is a view that is clearly different from that of other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws that have entered into force in mid-West Hungary now criminalize infringements of a 4-metre plot that the government has allowed to set up on the southern border with Serbia, and also establish longer periods of imprisonment for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Because of the situation of mass migration caused by the Hungarian government, the situation is threatening," said the rapporteurs of the Government of Zoltan Kovacs in the southern city of Szeged.
In this we have absolutely clear: illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Technically, Parliament must continue to approve the deployment of the army that was expected in the next week, but the Associated Press reporters at the border have been observing the heavy armed forces with vehicles and dogs for a few days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orbanan Counsellor for Domestic Defence, said that the authorities arrested 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 were already arrested on State territory.
They have been affected by the damage of the plate and are now accused of committing crimes under the new laws in police custody.
The authorities quickly let the board go.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia in the morning after using a train covered by the rest of the road.
At the main border crossing to Roszke, chaos arose because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and caused pressure on people.
About 20 went in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of refugees blocked the main border between Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Volby 2016: Hilly Clinton's victory before Bernie Sanders has reduced half of the national vote
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton's still holding a double-digit strike at the Democratic League on nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is bringing her fall.
Clinton now supports 47 per cent of democratic primary voters (a decrease of 58 per cent), while Sanders is on second place with 27 per cent (a rise of 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has already announced whether he will want to be president, receives 15% of the support of democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of major competitions, the most democratic voters claim that it is too soon to say that they are clear decisions that the candidate will support.
But Clinton's sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
From CBS News survey last month, Clinton's soil was lost under his feet in several demographic groups, while Sanders got a few times.
Clinton's got a big gap between women and calms down, but her behavior is inexhaustible.
Her support between men has been significantly reduced and Sanders is losing her only 5 points.
Clinton's success with democratic voters over 50 years has come to an end and now they're like Sanders.
Clinton's still got a big lead thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton's double-digit jump in front of Sanders between the Liberals, but now Sanders loses only 5 points in this group.
About half of the democratic primary voters in all states say she would strongly support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
The fourth would support it with certain benefits and the other 15 per cent would only support it because it is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
It may not be surprising that Clinton's current allies are particularly interested in it.
Views are mixed between those who do not support Clinton at present - only about a quarter would support it.
While 48 per cent of democratic primary voters say that they would strongly support Clinton, less republican voters also say about their favorites, Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton's advocates are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16%), it follows that it is time to be the woman's president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this job (10%).
Clinton's advocates also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is further mentioned that there is a great choice and agreement on problems.
While the Vice-President is considering a potential candidate for the president, 57 per cent of democratic primary voters would wish to do so - thirds think he should not.
When the primary democratic voters were asked who would choose as the second candidate for appointment of the party, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton's bidders, more than half of Biden's as their second vote, far before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to apply for the appointment of Democrats, the leadership of Hillary Clinton will be extended from 20 points when Biden will apply to 30 points without his candidate.
Fifteen per cent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning in general elections; however, this figure fell from 78 per cent last month.
Biden is far different in this measure, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely candidate is increasing.
However, when it comes to the issue of greater importance for candidates, democratic voters give priority to resolving problems before the greater opportunity to vote.
Like last month, not one democratic candidate or potential candidate does not appear as an enemy candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among the primary voters of their parties.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden leads all three of them to honesty, while Clinton's is a strong influence.
Thirty percent of the democratic primary voters do not think Clinton's fair and reliable, so twice as many as those who say so about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have this view.
The main democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological view.
With regard to all these measures, almost a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions regarding Hillary Clinton's decision on the use of her personal email and server as state secrets continue, most of the primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of this matter and say that their overall view has not affected her at all.
But between the U.S. public is a completely different story.
Half of the Americans are now upset with her explanation, while only about a third is calm.
The public's views on this topic were already divided into March, shortly after this problem emerged.
Most Americans claim that this e-mail controversy has no impact on their overall view of Clinton, while 36% of them have been distorted by Clinton.
It's mainly about the republics where more than 6 out of 10 claim their views on Clinton have deteriorated.
Although Clinton is considered to be honest and reliable among its voters, this issue remains a problem among registered voters in general: only 32 per cent sees it as fair and reliable, which is a decline of eight points from last month and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think they are honest and reliable.
And at least 55 percent of registered voters throughout the country do not see the Trump as honest and trustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump have good signs of leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush were among the most honest.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, many voters have not taken a look at him.
The failure of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ended up with Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest survey and the others are leaving a hearing of support.
A number of Republicans throughout the country continue to support the Trompa tree majority, with 23% of the support in the CBS last study carried out prior to the Fox News debate last month, 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% at the same time.
The study also found that Carson is leading a good way against demographic groups, and it lists the Turpa among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field with the exception of Carly Fiorin and the state governor of Ohio John Kasiche, is behind Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's full 10% support to the current 2%.
Former Governor Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in the third place with 6%.
The failure of 376 Republican voters in the latest study is plus 6% and ended in September.
The latest CNN/ORC study published last week showed that Carson has improved and achieved 19% of the support between the Republicans for the 32% support of the Trump.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post study also showed that Trump was extremely ahead of Carson.
In the course of Carson's trend, Trump decided to shoot a neurosurgeon in the service, and Carson even apologized for his statements regarding the Trup's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood accused of the death of a student of the first year of Baruch College
Nearly two years after the student died during a fraternal ritual in Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, he was charged with murder against five people.
The members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chuna "Michaela" Deng during the beginning of September 2013 and delayed him into the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police reported.
The police say he had a closed eye, he had a full bag of 30 pounds of weight and was repeatedly burdened when he tried to reach his goal through the frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about his headache and then fell unconscious.
The Pi Delta Psi members did not call 911 immediately after Deng recovered and apparently waited an hour before they took him to the hospital, the police say.
However, they found time to change Dengo's clothes, expose his symptoms and contact Andy Menga, the president of the international brotherhood, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Vagner brought him to the press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide their training and in particular gave priority to the welfare of the brotherhood before Michael Deng's life," said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't get back to life and died the other day in the morning.
According to the questionnaire, Deng was repeatedly hit by a dumb object into the head, body and stone.
" Too many families were tortured because of the persecution in the brotherhood, and at least one student dies every year because of the persecution since 1970," writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Dengo's family, in a statement.
The brotherhood and its members must be responsible and this step is important by the authorities.
The High Court of Monroe County recommended a third-level murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty other members of the brotherhood, including Mr Menga, will also be charged with the assault on the prosecution and the criminal society.
"We want to keep not only the participants, but if there is an organization that has approved it either officially or informally, we will also take them into account," Wagner said at the morning press conference.
Baruch College prohibited brotherhood and nationalism from breaking up its relationship with local communities.
This happens when Fed increases the interest rate
The increase in rates will come and the current market will collapse, debt benefits will rise and the economy will collapse.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it takes and how long it will last.
For the economy, the stories of a small source of timing are specifically offered.
The recession came after 11 months after the first increase in rates and took 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the federal reserve system in raising rates is often, although not always determined by how economic and financial assets will react.
That is why US central banks officials emphasized so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the rate increases, but rather the trajectory as long as normalisation takes place.
There's really more change in the game.
However, in the end, members of the market can be assured that any trend due to an increase in speed can be overcome.
"The first rise in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as the end of the era of 'legislance money'," pointed out Julian Jessop, leading global economy capital economics.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of American levels to the most common but still low, creating a seismic shock that many might fear.
It means it's coming to an unreceptive effect.
Here is the view on how some areas of the economy will react on the basis of historical trends:
In view of what the market has noted in the last few months, the expected increase in rates can make air slightly unstable.
As soon as the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There appears to be a trend for the re-stopping of the action after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the gap in the exchange policy," the Deutsche Bank analysts reported in a recent study on what happens after Fedu's increase.
More specifically, the market for the last 35 years is often the largest - about 14 per cent - is aimed at increasing rates in the area within 250 days (average increase of 2.6 per cent), and then returning to normal status after 500 days, with an average output from the last six cycles 14.4 per cent, according to recent analysis by Boba Doll, the main share strategy of Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the share tends to become more pronounced later in the rate increase cycle and return is beginning to decrease.
Stress is a fact of economic life, but increasing rates often help her.
At present, Fed faces certain conditions that have not yet existed and which could speed up the recession.
The most remarkable thing is that the rough home product near its lowest point in history when the feds rise.
According to Deutsche Bank, during an increase of 118 rates since 1950, only twice the nominal mid-year GDP growth was under 4.5 per cent.
Although in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 per cent, it was unlikely that he would be detained when in the third quarter only 1.5 per cent, says Atlanta Fed.
Increased rates in this complex economic background could be risky and the question could arise, "is this time different," Deutsche said.
The market participants were preparing for the growth of Fedu all year round and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee which ended this week and ended on Thursday.
While many strategies and economies believe that FOMC could accept growth at this meeting, future trade only indicates 25% probability.
"In our 1950 study, all the lifting cycles were back in the super cycle of boosting the peace effect with the hidden HDP tops of the start of the recession very soon after the start of the melting," says the report.
However, this was a markedly slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is far from those when Fed was waiting for the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we're 74 months and we're still going on.
A certain result was also volatile because the market is expected to increase rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to what they are doing.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in debt than in action when Fed changes policy direction.
In the long term, it appears that the outputs change the direction immediately after the first rise/down cycle.
At the end of the growth cycle, debt returns are falling immediately," Deutsche said.
Strategic Charlese Schwaba believes that increasing rates will lead to a close approach between long- and short-term loans, which will make the gap even worse.
Long-term high-performance letters often work better in this climate, even though "we are still careful to push the output," said Kathy Jones in his analysis, a firm analysis of fixed income in Schwab.
It's interesting that Jones thinks that markets are already adapted to the expectations of Fed politics.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has been adapted to more stringent exchange policies," she wrote.
The short-term rate rates are higher, the profit margin is wider, the credit fluctuation has increased and the volume has increased - all market features as Fed prioritises policy.
It is generally said that companies that do most of their business in the United States will win a higher rate and local products will become more attractive.
International companies will make a lot of debt up, because the growing dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be higher.
"History shows that "quality" actions tend to change within three months of the initial increase in rates," analyst Goldman Sachsve reported to customers.
With strong balances, the companies presented weak development companies in each increase in the rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 averaged 5 percentage points.
The companies with high capital outputs, as well as low-voltage shocks, have also overhauled their opponents with lower quality by average 4 (percent points), respectively 3 (percent points).
It's going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of mobility rates will lose most, Goldman said.
In addition to pure action games, consumers are also struggling with growing dollars.
Contestants can also see their profits through higher results, but experts have different views on how long this will last.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, claims Ambassador Andrew Bingham
Conservative Ambassador Andrew Bingham criticised this station for "invasion"
Stops the view that it is still more indisputable than its commercial rival.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards and says they're just subjugating Britty.
Ambassador colleague Damien Collins attacked Voice and says he's not the original idea
BBC Radio 3 "changes" in Classic FM, claims the former messenger and collects pure pressure to send to prove they're doing something they don't do.
Conservative Ambassador Andrew Bingham also told the BBC chiefs that the public service voting station may appear to be "undercovered" and is still more undiscoverable than its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be--I don't like to use the word "complicated"--but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards, started in December of the year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began in the long run, seems to be Britain under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- these are two examples that attack me when you actually just like what we already have on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director General of BBC rejected the charge with reason that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I've learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn't learn anything else.
And their commitment to live with music and the creation of music is actually at peak level.
"I also think that Radia 3's commitment to finding new songs and introducing new works into operation is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, the BBC Radio 3 Alan Davey regulator argued that it is now necessary to work harder to join the public than before because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only source of BBC production that was obtained under smoke because of cutting down on trade competitors during the delivery of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearing of the Commission.
Conservative Ambassador Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that BBC bought from the Dutch producer Talpa Media at the estimated price of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is being discussed as being not original and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars of Palma Faith andBoy George as judges - was made "the typical way for BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own state" when it's next to start a fun series.
However, he refused to exclude ordering more future series of The Voice series or spending money on other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales increase at least since August and can be Friday
The first three months of 2015 recorded 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth since the year 2000 began its own records
Internet sales were forced three years ago by mobile purchase
Experts believe that November's Black Friday could be a cause of loss
For more than a decade, virtual purchases have been on the rise, and thanks to it, many of the British main streets have become the cities of spirits.
However, experts claim that there are signs of online sales, and new data show a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total staff expenditure represented the lowest growth since the beginning of the 2000 measurement year, with an increase of only 5 per cent compared with the previous year.
Experts claim that online sales stop notes are being issued, and new data show a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the level of growth over the last few years and go back to the year 2000, the situation has always been rationalized in time," says Guardian Andy Mulcahy, editor of IMRG market index.
It explains that internet sales were forced three years ago when customers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to buy online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as for example on the buyer.
But now (growth) is falling somewhere, and that's why it seems to be falling apart.
The phenomenon of the Black Five, which was transferred from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers can keep buying before this event takes place last Friday in November.
In the past year, five times more than the average purchasers sold on their computers to order purchases and agree on several sales sites.
Experts believe that the Black Friday, through which the buyer is recontracting, can keep customers from other purchases
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of each £5 was lost online.
For some products, such as television and workshops, more than a third of sales are carried out via web sales.
At the same time more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of buying in stone fashion shops.
Muslims buried victims of the plague of iron in Mexico and the Bin Ládin family was penalized
The body of 29 dead was transferred by the streets of Muslims during the first funeral in Mexico.
Saudi Arabia partially captures wine for the collapse of the construction magnet Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health reported that 394 people were also injured after the plague hit
The hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the fall of the Great Mosque in Mexico. The victims' bodies were taken down the street.
Dressed in a certain measure in white, the mourners chose the road and gave the victim an account when the first of the victims arrived on their last road to the cemetery in Al-Moais.
The sad news was going around the holy place, where just a few days earlier the building railway broke down the ceiling of the mosque and fell to the believers.
The body was released for burial and the Saudi king punished the building group of Bin Ládin over a disaster that also left 394 wounded.
The bodies of 29 dead after the fall of the railway in Grand Central Moscow in Mexico were taken by the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first trip when the train broke.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of every year's journey.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that as soon as they arrive in Mecca, thousands of people will continue to enter the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group should not have left the upper arm while he was not in operation.
The Arab version of the statement, recently by the State of the Saudi Press Agency, states that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the strike.
The UK Department did not find this detail, but indicated that the company's chiefs were prohibited from travelling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to discover what led the train to the Grand Museum, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims coved before Hadj's visit later this month.
Binladin Group did not issue a statement on the collapse of the railway and was not made available to his representative for a comment.
The royal statements also accused the group of non-use of the latest security measures and lack of coordination with the meteorological authorities.
Tens of ships cover Grand Mosque in Mexico, which is part of the massive construction effort in front of Binladin Group.
Binladin's family was close to the Saudi governing family after the entire decade and are carrying out major construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaedy Usama bin Ládin was the son of a loser whose family died in the 1990s.
Havaria was in the midst of a strong wind and rain just a few days before millions of people in the kingdom were born on a path that at least once in their lives must embrace every vulnerable Muslim.
The authorities state that 158 people are still in the hospital.
The officials determined that one million riyars (£ 174,000) would be charged with related murders and the same amount for the duration of injury.

Chief B&Q claims that East European traders who are working in a low-income trend

Britons release goods and goods and hand them over to trained Eastern European farmers to work with them at home
If it comes to you with a ready or a malaria victim, it looks like you're in the minority today.
Because the British continue to employ more and more brokers to do customer work at home, according to the company chief Screawfix B&Q.
Veronique Lauri, the new executive director Kingfisher, who owns his own domestic network, says that a large increase in the number of students from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 other Screwfix stores intended for traders and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Lauri says she wants to hire more women in B&Q shops because eight out of ten purchase decisions in trade make better shares.
At present, most men's sex workers are working.
She said there was a need to address the growing demographic trends that reflected more female households, which are more than in the past.
Mrs. Lauri says, "We're still in business with most men.
We need to get closer to balance.
About half of our customers are women who make 80% of the product purchase decisions.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Lauri, who is one of the only five women in the Cormade of the leading company under the British FTSE100 Index, also restructured her team to reflect the balance between the directors and women.
Kingfisher is almost alone in that he has half the representation of women between employees including executive and financial directors.
Mrs. Lauri says: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
So it wasn't hard to find a good woman we'd take to us.
Kingfisher announced the loss of profits in half a year and sales after the group took over the cost of closing the shops.
As a result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new shops
The persinal contribution 600 korunas to the pensioners is at risk.
"It is the justice of equal complaints, it has nothing to do with human justice," said the vice-president TOP 09 Miroslav Kolosek, who highlighted the principle of subsidiarity.
The President of the Members of ODS Zbynok Stanjura noted that the single contribution would be good, but it would be better for him to be in standard valuation for years to come.
"We have room to find the mechanism we're going to order," said Stanjura.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michaely Marks (ČSSD), which suggested that the next year should be validated over the framework of the law.
Marks's argument was raised by the argument that it improves the social situation of pensioners who are not in line with it.
The higher valuation next year would mean the budgetary impact of the 5.5 billion crowns and ministers debate each stimilion.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) recalled that in the past it had reduced its valuation.
Report Miroslav Opalka (KSCHM) noted that the proposal does not address the reduction of real income in 2016 and later.
Veto's right of payment in December is extremely complex and possibly impossible, he said.
The President of the ČSSD Roman Skleňák therefore proposed a shorter period of time for the Committee's implementation of the rules for 10 or 20 days, even though this right was blocked.
But the committee will have a month to replace the usual two.
Bonus should be able to go out on a total of $1.73 billion.
Money should be paid in particular from the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs' budget.
In the next year, pensions should grow in the average of stock.
The contribution should be made by new pensioners who will have a pension benefit in December or its share.
They could get him who lost his pension money in December before it was paid.
But they would have to apply in writing for the fee, which is no later than the end of the following year.
Payments are regularly valued in the Czech Republic for the winter, and this is about the increase in prices and the third increase in real honey.
This year's money is worth 41.5 per cent of gross fraud, and next year it should be 40.5 per cent.
The State has invested 314.7 billion koruna in the state's state-of-the-art pensions, which was a total of five billion dollars per year.
Expenditure on care payments represented 26 per cent of all budget expenditure and 46 per cent of all expenditure required by the law.
The average interest rate of Lone has increased according to data in the national final account of 104 to 10.714 koruna.
The Czech social security administration provided an amount of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and a total of 17,000 measurable pensions.
Jakunin's left plans for a political career, he'll be given knowledge.
The Senate had a billionaire, according to Russian media, of course.
In the Federal Council, he was to represent the Western Kaliningrad region, whose Governor Nikolay Cukanov as a candidate for government party, the only Russian party had his post in Sunday elections with a view to launching.
According to Russian laws, the senator is not a citizen, but he is elected governor of three candidates whose names are known before the governorial elections.
After the election, the senator from three candidates will choose himself.
It was a complication for Jakunina that he did not live in the Kaliningrad region for 20 years as required by the law.
The Kremlin for Jakunina has found an exception to being an extraordinary and filled-up vice-president who does not apply the legal requirement of long-term residence.
It ended the Czech comedy Theory of Tigers.
The last seizure in the main hero's head is the voluntary death of his chain of strength and endurance.
Grandma - Iva Janjuro decided about grandfather's life, old age and funeral.
Janov is clear that his wife, Olga - Eliška Balzer, is on a similar path.
Remember that when he had his own desire and dreams, he wanted to live a decent and free life again.
It also gains the government over its life - and as a solution it chooses to flee from it, it has led to the story of Slavík.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel fully free.
It was clear from the beginning that Bartošk’s main role was to work with him in the Impartial Series.
However, he was surprised by the early heretics who appeared before the camera after another stop associated with the reconvalence after a serious disease.
We made a deal with each other three years ago.
I gave him to read the script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And he surprised me that he's probably a busy sportsman.
In the past, he always wondered where he was going to sit before the next scene.
This time he walked on the bike, went down the stairs and even walked into the cabin.
And that's all in record tropical circles, the director subsisted.
According to Bartoška, a couple of women are taking a tiger to make a queen from him in time.
They'll get him some food, but then they'll close the door so he won't have to play outside the Queen on a tiger.
And that's what we're trying to do.
His wife, who can cause a mildly negative effect on the monsters, created Eliška Balzer.
She's not just a negative attitude.
He's also pleasant, intelligent, empathy and he thinks it's good.
But at the same time, she's a surrogate and wants to convince her husband of his death, the son of Bajgar.
The film parallels the judgments of Jan's married daughters Olinky and Alenky - Táni Vilhelm and Paul Beretov - and aunts Erica and Pepika - Jiři Havelka and Jakob Kohák.

Azerbaijan has cancelled Telečk's visit on the criticism of human rights violations.
The Czech Ambassador of the European Parliament for the arrest of UNO Pavel Telicka has postponed his short fourth trip to Baku because today the Azerbaijani authorities have cancelled the official part of his visit.
According to Telicsky, this is justified by the EP resolution last week, which criticises the violation of human rights in Azerbaijan and which Telicka was a co-author.
In its decision, the Azerbaijani party Telicka explained in a press release his Brussels office the possibility of having discussions with official partners and the visit of political prisoners, which depends on the agreement of the authorities.
The road planned a few months ago, Telicka wanted to use the text sent to the CTK to meet with Parliament's leadership and representatives and representatives of democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners.
The EP resolution condemns "uneven repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European representatives to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political prosecution.
The resolution was adopted shortly after a recent ruling on the Azerbaijani opposition journalist Chadidje Ismail, who was based on the discovery of corruption in government circles.
Russia is not surprised that he is building his airport in Syria.
Bogdanovski at his visit to Novosibirsk did not rule out that in the future the Russian air base in Syria will arise.
We don't have such plans yet.
Nothing, but it's not excluded, he declared.
Russia already has a flying sea base in Syria in the port of Tartus, which has already been used as a service and logistics centre.
According to the Russian press report, since the beginning of the Serbian supply of Russian weapons and military material to Syria has risen.
According to Moscow, there are arms shipments resulting from the existing trade agreements.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians are planning to set up an airport in the city of Latakya, which in the past remains the village of Syrian President Bashar Asad.
Washington, however, does not have a clear understanding of Russia's specific military intentions in Syria, the American commentators agree.
Foreign Minister John Kerry spoke to Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on the situation in Syria this morning, their third telephone conversation in the last ten days.
The next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu comes to Moscow to stress the concern about the gathering of the Russian arsenal near Israel.
The speaker of the White House Josh Earnest marked Asada's support from Moscow for a preserved garden.
Russia's policy objectives in Syria have been declared to be more unclear.
According to him from Syria, Moscow made its satellite.
This may mean that President Vladimir Putin is following a rather long-term goal, but which, according to Ernesta, is not quite clear.
In Syria, according to today's Russian press speculation, Putin's main theme is the upcoming UN Wall Summit meeting in New York.
On the other hand, the Russian leader in the Ukrainian Donbas was not able to speak in agreement.
According to reports today's list of The New York Times, the US government is not surprised that President Barack Obama could meet with the Russian President during the UN session.
The views between White House councillors are still spreading.
The TASS agency today, referring to the word of Kremlin-speaking Dmitri Peskov, wrote that Putin has not yet been on the program of his neural residence meeting with Obama.
Set sezam oil at the breast-feeding diet, which helps to enhance immunity.
The best way to increase the intake of non-insulated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra pannesic oils.
All healthy substances will remain in the oil when leaching from seed for the cold.
That is why these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as guinea pigs.
Some extra pancreas oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
They have just been the most common cause of the death of the Czechs, according to the Institute of Medical Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic for several years.
The larynx infection is mainly affecting women. It helps to neutralize the oil.
If you belong to lovers of Asian cuisine, you must not miss the taste of the orange oil, which is part of the original recipes for exotic foods.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used when heat correction is made and has a number of adverse health effects.
It is often used in breast-feeding.
The essential fatty acids that contain are a good prevention of the origin of yellow stones.
These are from 90% of the causes of genital mutilation and women suffer from these problems three times more frequently than men.
In general, the problem with lead is particularly affecting people who do not sport and consume many animal fats.
Sesame oil can be used successfully in the liver diet, which is very similar to that of the liver.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that lead to the consumption of this oil, they should pay attention to goods from exotic food stores.
Asian producers are often used for leaching seeds that have a greater taste.
But the oil comes with all the active substances, Ladislav Hačeký, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk, who produces the Pannesian oil leached for the studio.
The company also makes a new combination of oil and uses an extremely unpaved seed of the white sesame.
In an hour, it'll be able to take our line out eight kilograms.
By mechanical washing the raw material shall be heated at a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the labelling of extra panensic.
At higher temperatures there would be a loss of nutrients.
The sun's oil sings when it's sick of the heart and the veins.
The Czech favorite among oil is solar.
A study by Jarmily Hamersky, who led to the University of Masaryk, revealed that he prefers it in the hot kitchen 43% of respondents.
However, it is not really appropriate to reduce it, and it is already starting to refuel at 180 °C.
It is better to use it, for example, on salad juice and is especially used in a diet that helps prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It also contains a high proportion of 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which are the most low of all fatty acids.
In case of heart problems, attention should be paid to the amount of total intake of fat and calories.
For example, in one bed of sun oil is 62 calories, in the bed of fish oil is 99 calories.
As far as energy values are concerned, it is important to realize that natural foods are much more suitable with nutrients than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially managed products.
That's why it's appropriate to pick up extra pancake oil.
This solar is going to last as long as 9 months.
The storage in the refrigerator is still longer.
Old oil people are especially familiar with the rising noise.
On the contrary, he didn't rely on the ground.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
The total oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of the technical cape are used for so-called superfoods and therefore the total oil is considered to be the most healthy of plant oils.
For this indication, the maximum content of omega 3 and omega 6 of unsaturated fatty acids is added.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body itself and must be taken from food.
It is particularly important to take in 3 fatty acids.
The scientific studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Life have shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while Icelandans take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
The total oil is appropriate to be placed in the dining room as part of the support diet for enhancing immunity and treating injury.
It has antihypertensive effects and is an essential part of the boncho membranes.
People don't have to be afraid of using condom oil, it doesn't contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that he found this oil road to consumers confirms that the company of Bohemia Oil is one of the best sellers.
He sells it every year 500 litres.
People often use one lie after the wound.
The conical oil is not quite quite spectacular, but powerfully immunization, recommended by Daniel Vlček from the beautiful company Bohemia Oly.
According to statistics, they are the most common nation of Americans.
For one house there is 1.4 grids.
Then there are the most diverse competitions throughout the world, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
They're not even Czechs in the back.
On the basis of consumer research in the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people didn't grow up in life.
The simple majority then screams several times a year.
In order to be successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to repair the mass by marinating several hours before the heat adjustment.
Which oil is the most suitable and at the same time leaves a healthy substance alive in the process of germination?
It is generally paid that in its own process of rinsing it should be covered by fat.
Experts agree that much of the oil begins to lose its flavor at high temperatures.
Healthy extra pannes oil also comes about the body of good substances that we otherwise obtain when we consume oils from food corrected at lower temperatures.
This does not mean, however, that extra pannesic oils will not be used when cooking.
It's a terrible oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When it comes to mass, experts from the Bohemia Oil company from Kraslic in Sokolovsk will immediately produce a huge oil.
It adds a taste of mass and fish.
The kitchen features the unique properties of raising the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for drying and cooling because it has a high temperature of up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature as one of the small oil preserves the health of the prosperous substance, Daniel Vlček describes the benefits of the huge oil from Bohemia Oil company, which belongs to a few Czech producers of this oil from wine.
Experts agree that crude oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It continues to contain high levels of linear acids and is therefore effective in the fight against excess cholesterol.
Our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Due to the toxic content of these substances, it helps reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidney.
We also help to enhance our external beauty - improves the elasticity of the skin, is used to treat acne and helps care for dry and flat hair.
The chefs appreciate the use of terrible oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold creams such as salting, but also for the heat treatment of foods.
Therefore, in the case of grilling, it can be used immediately in two ways, when marinating and on its own.
By marinating meat and fish we maintain their purity.
There must be three ingredients: oil, acidity and corrosion in preparation of marinades.
For example, we add oxygen to the apple egg, and we're aiming at cutting down the meat.
Swimming gives again meat and oil preserves and gives the right order, says Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, it adds that huge oil is ideal for marinating because as one of the few oils it can penetrate through dark mass.
So the marinated mass or the fish are ready for landing how to proceed?
Extra pancake oil is indicated by just a few cups to prepare food.
It's the same payment for the grilling.
Some of the oils are for this way of preparing a simple taboo.
This is particularly true of lignite, conical and fish oil which should not be consumed at all.
Before cooking, you need to grow oil, thus preventing food from burning.
Preparation of the Annex is also an essential part of the
To grilled meat and fish, practically anything - grilled green, preserved bread, light green salad and many others.
Bohemia Oil chefs recommend, for example, the High summer salad.
You need it: • 1 sachet • 1 sachet of hands • 1 sachet of pasta • 1 sachet of salad leaves • 3 sachets of crude oil
Add to the salad table a mixture of salad leaves with dried hands, cooked chicken and on large bones with blond broccoli.
Depending on the taste of the sauce and the flavor, you can also smell the sweet chili and soy sauce.
Finally, dig a few cups of terrible oil.
Then you can make salads with a lot of cooked almonds for a special taste.
Diluted sclerosis: not only does it depend on medications but also on the patient’s desire to fight.
Dissolved sclerosis is a complex disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: neurologists, physiotherapy, ergotherapy, urologists, ophthalmologists, psychologists, psychiatrists and many other specialists.
However, it is not only medical care, for example, that women with osteoporosis need advice if they decide to have a child, to take care of these patients and social advice, to improve their housing, etc.
However, all of this is not enough: the development of disabilities can affect the patient in a major way.
The more he is able to fight his disabilities, the longer he can work and has no need to change his life-style.
As cautioned by doctors, the passive presence of patients leaves room for disease activity.
For example, it has been shown that regular movement significantly takes time when the patient needs some compensation, such as lead.
It is important that patients and their environment not be subject to various disorders, for example that the disease is automatically leading to the end of the vehicle.
This is why the Day site has created a chance (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the current media campaign.
The most important person in the care of the patient with dilute sclerosis is neurologist.
In dilute sclerosis, it has been said twice that as the disease starts to be treated earlier, the doctor may be more likely to influence something.
It's because we've got drugs at a frustrated sclerosis at an alarming stage when the neurodegeneration process isn't so strong yet.
The earlier we arrive, the greater the hope is that we will be able to stop and remove disability, explained MUDr. Eva Medov of the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty of Diseases in Prague.
It is very important for people with osteoporosis, which most often solves the weakness of lower limbs or imbalances.
It works with patients according to their individual needs: maintenance of the condition, improvement of the skin, strengthening of the day-to-day, restlessness or improved coordination.
"It's really individual, depending on the specific patient's problems," says MUDr. Martina Kovári, headmaster of Rehabilitation Clinic and physical medicine Faculty Hospital in Motole.
People with depressed sclerosis suffer the same drawbacks, but this is a little different in every way.
Rehabilitation can't stop the disease, but it can always calm down its symptoms.
The movement activity also reinforces the immune state of the body, which is in the case of depleted sclerosis requesting.
Another positive aspect of regular exercise is the fact that patients check what they can do, which strengthens their safety.
"In exercise, endorphins also flow and people feel good about it," warns PhD. Kamila Ráss of the Rehabilitation Clinic of the Royal Vinohrad Royal Hospital.
By affecting the physical page, we affect the lymphatic system responsible for emotions.
That's how we get into mental and immune processes and stabilize the disease.
"In the past these patients have been so examined, we know today that they need a target burden," says Professor PaedDr. Pavel Kolár, clinic for rehabilitation and physical therapy.
The objective of physiotherapy is to keep a person as comfortable as possible, including work order.
Therefore, physiotherapists work with ergotherapeutics so that each person can receive compensation for his or her peace.
Many patients also need psychological or psychiatric care.
They're in a difficult situation of life.
When a serious disease comes to your life, most people will find it.
They live in shock, panic, fear.
He has to respond to a great deal of stress - a loss of health.
With such a heartbreaking soul we have to go after someone, not try to destroy everything on our own.
"I work with them so that they can finally come to the conclusion that even with disabilities they can live a life of comfort and that frustrated sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertová from the neurological clinic General Faculty of Medicine in Prague.
Without the Polish producer Latecoere by airbusy they haven't flew.
Air production is a synonym for precision and advanced technologies.
The new aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials that no one can produce and process immediately.
However, it can be found by super-transparent computers controlled by machine machines, by car keys for creating compositions on something as common as merunk pecks.
In the bubble, which reminds you of the sugar waffle, in a pile of powder, the leaves of the leaves that just came out of the welding machine.
"No one has ever come to anything better since," smiles Ivan Dubski, director general of the manufacturer of the airport gate Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the area of the Prague Flights, the former airport is a complete port for Airbus A320.
As the only ones in the world give the door to the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, which form part of Prague, also enter the first and highest classes on the top decks of the world's largest airbus A380 aircraft.
There are also gates full of compositions for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
The accuracy is the main motto.
Maybe the moment keys allow the company to serialize twice a year.
If there is a lack of control record on the yellow seal, the Prague competition should explain to the Airbus or Boingers who are regularly driving to find out if the doors are made in accordance with the agreed rules.
The human senses, but the advanced technique has not yet been fully replaced.
On one door to A320 there is 1500 knots.
You have to wrap your nails manually.
It'll take them two days.
And according to the sound of an attractive keyboard they know if it's already properly wrapped.
Tolerance, where they move, is minimal.
It can be found above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimetres.
It's a piece of human hair's double head.
A number of trained masses will be used for controls.
When the controller passes his finger on a series of needles, he knows if there are any extra tolerances.
Then we'll take the exact angle.
Flights before 1989 the L-39 programme of the course of the military flight.
In 1991 there was no one else.
The company had to find new orders quickly.
At the time, it was combined with the European manufacturer of Airbus.
She won the selection order on suppliers of the required door for model A321.
The conversation with Boeing wasn't so happy.
"We were then a small company that didn't have enough money to invest and so that Boying could guarantee long-term stable supplies," Dubsky recalls.
The door to the American producer would remain closed if it did not attend the 1999 Prague conference of the International Aeronautics Industry Association of the French Group of Latecoera.
I talked there about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day, she broke up with the French, says Dubsky.
A year later, Latecoer bought a Czech company and a strong company came with new orders.
In 2000, the installation of the part of the door for A320 was opened.
Three years later, the door of the upstairs deck for A380 arrived.
In 2006, the company set up a new composition hall for Boeing Dreamliner supplies.
Without Latecoer we wouldn't get on our own to this big deal.
Maybe we could do parts or small parts.
Partners want a guarantee of delivery for twenty or thirty years, Dubsky explains.
Loni, the Czech Latecoere, won over 2.9 billion euros and profit after a fine of 147 million kroner.
The exclusive position between the suppliers of the aircraft is not free.
Latecoer in Prague has invested 1.5 billion crowns since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 special manufacturing processes certifications and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the company wouldn't have built any doors in the airport.
To obtain certificates that manufacturing processes meet customer requirements, and to maintain them in repeated controls are in line with the DBM.
Production processes change every year.
They're more precise and tighter.
We need to train the employee, equip the equipment and re-certify the whole process, the Dubsky.
Now, the company is preparing a process for packing the chain and nothing that will replace the human health burden of harmful cadmium.
The task came from the manufacturer, but then the technology had to adapt to the equipment or chemicals used in Prague.
People from Boieng will come and check the concept of the whole line.
Then we'll bring them the product.
They're also checking our lab.
One seed of samples weighs itself in their laboratories and then compares the results with ours, approaching the Deep Way of Control by the pickers.
In return, the Prague company has long-term exclusive contracts.
The Prague race stands today and the production of embryos falls.
For A320 it produces half of the total volume of the door.
Reimbursing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European producer.
But that doesn't mean he could say any price at the door.
The part of the contract is a price claim.
It turns out how many doors one will stand after ten, fifty, the same pieces made.
The price for cheese is always reduced to a certain limit value.
We need to get into this price model.
If we don't, we'll work, says Dubsky.
Half of the halls, where they complete the electrical cabinet for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft, are still empty.
But it's a symbol of the future.
Here again, a new polybottic line is built for the construction and installation of the door for the innovative model A320 Neo.
It'll speed up and clear.
"It's a trend that the installation is going to take place in the airport," Dubsky adds.
It's going to have a future line secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have already ordered 3278 pieces of new model A320.
Only a few meters away from the starting line for the complete assembly door for the upper deck A380.
It's a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production time and reduce costs.
A full installation could start in two years, says Dubsky.
However, prior to this, the company must carry out the qualifying tests necessary for the installation of certain electrical and electronic devices at the door for the greatest Airbus.
The company is also responsible for further development of products from composite materials.
In addition to Boying, she should also participate in the new Airbus A350 programme, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It is a huge credit for the company when it is able to process compositions in addition to metal materials," says Dubsky.
However, latecoere is provided in the Czech Republic with production capacity.
There's no place else in the airport where he lives.
Before the French mother came in, she had 180 employees.
Now he's got 800, and for three years he could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are to predict how many hundreds of new aircraft are ordered every year, there must be no fear.
Although he had orders a few years ago, the parent company of Prussian Latecoere was facing the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money to pay for a loan.
Finally, Latecoere was able to talk to the main believers.
At the end of August, some loans were exchanged for shares.
The creditors obtained an increase of EUR 57.4 million in the company by 37.4 per cent.
The company owes two thirds, then 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial cure came to the beginning of the harvest.
The company concluded a new share of EUR 222.9 million between existing shareholders.
The basic capital totalled EUR 280 million.
In addition, the entire group is suffering from the growing production of Airbus and Boijeng, which share 85 per cent on the markets.
The average growth of the ban is expected to be four per cent annually by 2017.
In the order book, orders amounting to EUR 2.6 billion, which corresponds to four-year production.
The French media claim that Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on the carpets.
The Czech race in the Prague Latvians is important for the group.
The group's market is up to 16 per cent.
According to the number of employees, the largest foreign side group is.
Ambassadors supported most of the state's oil payments.
The change in non-increasing payments will result in a state deficit of 427 million more than in 2013.
As a result of the municipal budget, the government has a neutral impact because the fee has to be higher.
In the previous year, citizens received a total of 450 million dollars and a national budget of 150 million dollars.
From the heavy demand for coal came about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns for the state.
The novel is also calculated by increasing the reward from the winning room with a allowed weight of 1,000 korunas per hectare per year.
Acceptance of these grants will continue to be a full-scale citizen.
Minister of Industry Jan Mádek (ČSSD) told the delegates that the cities are getting instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns annually.
The higher tax rates will no longer be determined by the law but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The award shall be re-calculated as a percentage of the amount of the outstanding growth and the rates for individual types of non-increased growth.
According to the government, there is a reason for changes beyond the possibility of a positive response to the current economic situation.
Ambassador ODS Marek Banda, however, warned that the establishment of a fee under the government regulation should not be in accordance with the statute.
According to Minister Mádka, however, there is no tax in this case because the state pays off the state's state-owned state-owned growth.
Payments are made only by citizens whose territories are seriously affected.
In the case of deep difficulties, the coal will receive three quarters of the city’s money and a quarter of its state.
The same will be true in the case of radioactivity hormones.
The amount of money to be paid out of the difficulties will be effectively linked.
For example, 28 per cent will have to be repaired after pregnancy or for the purpose of providing banking services.
The proposal was criticised by the opposition envoys today, who said in particular that it would harm the population and the country.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starostov) warned that tax firms would no longer want to sponsor citizens as yet because they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve your budget by the Minister of Finance," said David Kádner (Suscit) who was elected in the Eastern country.
KSCHM Hana Aulikká warned against increasing unemployment in Moscow.
Kaddner and Aulikka failed to propose a new refusal, Kuchera wanted to return the law to the government for processing.
According to the original report, the increase in prices in coal prices is not mentioned in the company's tax company, as prices are from more than 90 per cent long term.
The main consumers as electricity or heat should therefore not feel the rising price.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that tax organizations will compensate for the increase in the budget for the effort to reduce their operating costs, which would in particular mean reducing the number of employees," the government said.
However, it argues that the increase in employment costs is inevitable.
According to the New Milan Urban (ČSSD) report, it is crucial that the Members should know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and mainly the government's decision on the limits of coal.
If the coal is to be weighed beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on the benefits for the state and the public, it will highlight.
The City does not agree with Mádk that the decision to break the threshold at the bottom of the Czechoslovakian Army should fall by 2020.
The thresholds below ČSA should be broken by reason of social, national economic and long-term stability of telecommunications.
Time for the decision on the rates for the United States Federal Reserve
The whole world is following how the United States Federal Reserve wants to meet in the middle of two days and Thursday to make a fundamental decision on whether to increase the rate rates for the first time after almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economics by the Reuters agency found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve was making a decision now think that they would remain inactive for some time and leave the rate rates at 0-0.25 per cent.
It's a historic event because it's been a long time since Fed's reduced rates to zero.
First of all, we are approaching a situation where the main central bank could be able to get out of zero gaps and start the process of standardizing levels," says Angel Ubide, a leading staff member of the Peterson Institute for the International Economy.
The U.S. economy has led to a relatively well-being in terms of adding trillions of dollars to state accounts and creating only low-level inflation.
However, Fed cannot ignore a less pink global perspective.
They warned markets to be prepared to increase, but circumstances suggest that they also see a great chance against this step.
The decision shall be notified on Thursday 20:00 A.M.
A gunman at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his friend in Mississippi on Monday - and later the same day his colleague - wrote a letter stating that he had his first murder and that before he could take it back, they found it in the government's office on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, reported that Lamb, a teacher of geography and social science at Delta State University, called the police in the morning about ten hours a day.
And he said he shot someone.
The expert's Lamb asked him to send a cop to his house.
He said: "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there is a "disgusting dog" in the house which "will not feed anyone" but is broken.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
The Lamb also didn't explain why he shot at the house.
When the police arrived at the scene, 41 - year - old Amy Prentiss found a written letter from Lamba, where she said: “I am so sorry and sorry that I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving the relationship, Lamb left 300 miles long road to Delta University, where he killed the professor of history Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
Thanks to William LaForge University, he said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "in Mr. Lamb's head there was obviously something."
Despite the Monday announcement that Lamb had evidently believed in the romantic relationship between Amy Prentiss and Schmidt, government authorities indicated that there was no "no evidence" on the "mercy triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who was with Prentiss' wife over seven years ago, said she was "a great person".
The divorce came 15 years ago, but they're both friends.
The 19th-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was "extended".
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Lindsday Knowles, Prentiss' close friends, as Sun Herald put it, worked Prentiss from home via the Internet.
Knewles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Blesk, walked with Lambe for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," she said to know.
The police reported that Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he was "not going to jail".
When the police got him off the road near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
According to a biography published on the websites of schools, Lamb got a doctorate at the University of Delta in the spring of 2015.
The Stars Who Lost Their Cosmos
Herec (left), on the picture with his son Redmond (right), has several stressful years behind him.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and lost his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett because of cancer.
Herec also had a drug problem and was detained in 2008.
I'm sure all these things choose their taxes.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be a couple of months out of the game because of a double break.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right foot during the conquest of Manchester United in Lize Misters against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defense left this wound in the ears and ordered it from games for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks that Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury caused an invisible stroke of Hector Morena in 15 minutes when 20-year-old Shaw flew into the PSV space.
Nine minutes he was injured in the game and also needed oxygen mask before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double leg fracture and now he's in the hospital."
It will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps later and then transferred to Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who comes to Manchester at the age of 18 has a very difficult time, but he's playing fantastically and then this happens.
When he was in shock, he also had an infected oxygen mask.
It's a play.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture requires six months of treatment and will not be able to play in a group phase.
I believe he's still playing this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a pen.
The decision-makers Nicola Rizzoli Mexicon didn't notice.
Van Gall indicated that the Italian decision-maker was wrong.
You can decide for yourself whether it was about a pen and a red card.
It was a very unpleasant break of both legs.
A tweet from Shaw says, "Thank you all for their messages, words can't express how I've been destroyed, my journey to the east is starting now and I'll come back even stronger."
Related: Manchester United reported Luke Shaw's injury in a fight against PSV
The English defence will have added motivation for the conquest of Europe's art in France on next July.
Phillip Cocu, a PSV trainer, said, "It was a very serious injury."
If any player leaves the game with such injuries, everyone is very sad about it.
It's never our players' goal to hit the opponent.
Moreno suffered his leg fracture at the game for Mexico against Van Gaal of Holland in 2014 on the world's mastership.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the seriousness of such injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I wasn't able to cross this moment.
I saw only a sword that guided to another direction, so it seemed that [Moren] touched him, but I didn't see a break on Luke.
In a conversation for SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel so bad about it. I'm sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardo was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smalling.
David Cameron probably knows The Lorax better?
Each parent knows this: When a child loves the book, it doesn’t last long before he learns to remember it.
You mustn't be David Cameron anyway.
In order to name a favorite book of children, she chose the president of the government of Lorax, a baby from Dr. Seusse in 1971.
It was difficult to choose, Cameron writes in a report published on the website of SuperCamps and continues: "Amazing, intelligent, creative and powerful content, I loved reading this to my children, because it was always an image or message I've never seen before."
Well, then, in the next paragraph, Cameron described in detail the book according to the 2012 film release, which added additional posts and details to complete the original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is comedite, a boy named Ted hopes that he will get the heart of girls his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," is an expert book that marks the object of love unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
Jacobs was not alone enough to be suspicious, the text added by Cameron is read as a total lecture of Lorax, which is on the Internet Movie Database page, and begins with the words: "In Thneed-Ville with a cloud of lightning where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is comedite, a boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of his dreams girls, Audrey."
Because he was open to practical parents, it seems unlikely that Cameron would have met with the event of a book where the most named young man would find out that the local man is exaggerating the grassy, woody industrialist One-ler, who, despite the protests of the titled Loraxe, a broken, priestly creature who "talks about trees."
With the highest probability of being so relatively low a significant PR task got an assistant who never read Lorax's child 20 times during the trial.
Speaking Downing Street said the text probably came from Cameron's staff office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text provided an employee of Cameron, but no other comment.
Adam Lyth was at risk of warning England, but he's still holding.
Coping with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but following the team that England has chosen on this tour, I think the 3-0 package that has endured in the past in the pilot series is unlikely.
I wouldn't be able to get away with the host's win.
The Alastair Cooka side can be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin Players in this balling system and also the collective thought is strong; there are no challenges since 2012, only a youth's positive.
With the sword, Moen Ali is developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the test series, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth came out of England's team in a series trial and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to mention Adam Lytha is a hard time for me to analyze because his main coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests continued to meet two good attacks in order and simple, but the fact is that they are cricket players based on performance.
For example, around the name Joe Root, there were no questions, which led to the announcement because — and I mentioned earlier — players are their best sectors.
A few more years ago, Lyth could have extended his series, but he had control over his own judgment.
Let's hope that if he gets more escapes for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
Chief coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his position, even though his performance was not entirely percentage, and it doesn't surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much time the pilot will get to show himself is a hard one.
Lyth got seven chips — like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Just Compton got his chances home and out.
The only thing you can take for granted is that England gave Jonathan Trottt the first chance in the Caribbean — although Lyth was in the best form — but this exciting opportunity is already past.
Alex Halles is coming and it's a pallet I appreciate very well.
It's a x-factor player of the cricket we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season when he got 236 on the Trent Bridge game that did so little.
At least the same opportunity must be given to him by his predecessors, but this will of course depend on the overall composition of the United Arab Emirates.
The idea when Moen starts on the side of Cooka, who would get another extra spinner while holding four kicks, was over and I don't have any reward against her.
I don't understand why the strikemaker can't fire and this levork man has already shown that he's a great cricket player.
Moen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but for them was number 3 and there's no big difference in it.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 exams before his release in 2001.
Suddenly, three centuries later, he was not even seen.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as the main spinner, and when I had the opportunity to follow him, he treated me like a very successful young man.
People can look at his rough statistics — an average of 31 with a ball and 35 with a sword — and I see it as a pram, but there are not many spinners who would raise their hands and pick up for young people.
That's a lot to learn from this tour.
In addition, it seems that England has made several changes and wise additions to their training staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardenea, a packer from Sri Lanka, as an expert consultant for pilots can be a mystery tah.
He's one of the most beautiful players who will bring rich experiences because they have experience with all conditions and attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the tour white-ball and brings to the team such as energy, so unmerited.
I've always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether he's already a player or a coach, and just like Mahela has an intelligence that can be used.
New voices in the classroom, even though they are voices that say things like consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes relax and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham Ben Stokes has received one-day freedom, just like Root has got a similar stop against Australia, and I have no problem with this decision.
Even though many disagree, trainers and electors do not form a harmonograph.
And you have to remember as players that their work depends on results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could be won if the economy begins to rise by 2017.
An unintended strategy for David Cameron's renegotiation for Britain's stay in the EU will come to other problems with every relevant day and without the choice of General Jeremy "Yes or No?" Corbyn will head to the Part-party, or will come to the TUC tomorrow to the whole situation around Europe.
The foreigners also have their Corbin and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is sinking into the various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough British self-centered, shared concessions and Russian changes to the treaty that most of them do not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided not to do so even if they were deprived of social protection.
We can even call it ourselves Dave and George's agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a photo before the famous local monuments, with or without local stores, and then return home with the words that they win the alliance for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants independent Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - means that some short-term ministers and officials in some major cities have reached the point where they are not concerned about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a German obviously-based office, was a link, but she was in power for 10 years and wanted to leave her post before she became a bad person, as it was in too long going on with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Francouz François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power also falls.
Poland can soon have a nationalist government on the right side, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to see how the feet of the British Selfie could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they don't want themselves because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan extremely useless notes of the SNP style during the campaign before the 2017 referendum in Great Britain to speed up the Brexit process, says a friend.
"Reconnaissance solved the problem" and "British has nothing to do with reconciliation."
Europeans to their own business know how Tree Fleet Street can be and how sceptic to the EU are the prints of oligaric barons, because they were not during the 1975 inspired Tony Benn's referendum, which supported our 1973 entry into measure 2:1.
They can remember the name Boris Johnson, a successful Euro-portunist who made his name so that the Brussels report "EU right bananas" would begin in the early 1990s.
Despite his achievements, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the combinations of free taxes, foreign phone hackers and non-seasonal departments that owned most of the big news.
In fact, Tony Blair was thinking about them the same thing, but he realized that when you're in the cage, you're gonna have to threaten her with bananas to keep you from dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself than when he reviewed Cameron's reference routine from the time Blair accepted the principle of the EU's broken constitution, which was overthrown by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and received a visa card.
The press never let him do it either.
But my dear Jeremy Corbyn, who paid me in the Westminster on Monday for my friend's back - I told him I shouldn't waste any more time - seems to be in danger of the repeated adoption of the Mordoch Neil Kinnock strategy, which was still missing.
It may take some time, but it needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but with Andrew Marrem, whose face at the BBC last Sunday.
Corbin's official position towards Europe, I'll say it's nice, they're developing.
He claims he would like to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people, despite the prevailing attitude of the Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englishism, can certainly access it.
That's what Hillary said "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn on the radio and television this week when he couldn't decide to let Corbyn's appointment as the shadow office was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father fought on television about his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
The Hillary game was much more attractive.
But to fight to remain "for all circumstances" - Bennina phrase - according to all that McDonnell didn't say, nor did the JC say to his colleagues and Members at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever, sensitive image Corbyn wants to share - remember, touched me - the message discipline remains important during the whole day of television transmission, especially in faith, paranoia and betrayal, which are social media.
It is a pleasure not to offer Cameroon a free access to Europe, which would enable him to consider the support of the Party in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell put it.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell's and Corby's fundamental statement on EU membership - according to their Bennita's slowing economic, anti-capitalistic past - is no longer the issue of esoteric debate between the left-wing dissidents, for which Narcissism is the central basis of dogmatism.
Just like his statement about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end - foreign diplomats will have to try to understand the meaning of all this for their own masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital - also have suspect voters - because of the British concession when it seems too important?
The United States is already quite relieved of the British "low military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, and this is even in reducing the costs of the conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the beginning of the afternoon of something called the British Security Forum.
Experts criticise reviews on electronics published by Public Health England
The government's declaration to the funding agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking has resulted in a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are connected to the tobacco industry, by researchers.
The experts in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet's criticism of the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE agency published a "mechanical" report last month and described it as a "complex examination of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the content of the data and warned about the relationship between some experts and the tobacco industry.
In its professional journal Lancet last month, the "extraordinary charter base", on which the PHE agency established its main conclusions.
Two other experts who wrote for BMJ questioned the claim that it was probably "founded on a rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They believe that the public could expect that the claim of the PHE agency, which says "the best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking", is based on a detailed examination of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a single meeting of 12 people authorized to carry out the analysis of the multi-criteria Decision (MCDA) model to synthesis their views on the damages associated with various products containing nicotine; the results of the treatment were included in the research report.
McKee and Capewell state that a sponsor of this meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health whose director-general has probably already received financial resources from British American Tobacco for independent study.
He also approved the public health confidence in the sustainability report, he says.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting recognized funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding he had received in advance from Philip Morris International.
The reason for selecting panel members is not available, but they contain several well-known electronic cigarettes champions, some of which also announce industrial funding in the newspapers.
Some other participants at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The PHE meeting also took part in tobacco management.
The report in this group "expressive access", missing "solid evidence of the injury to most of the products on the criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claim that "there is still no evidence that e-cigarettes would act as a way of smoking for children or non-smoking," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, stated that the claim in BMJ was already responsible.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
One of the two living chickens dies because of its dependence.
All evidence indicates that the health risk posed by electronic cigarettes is relatively small, but we must continue to test long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there was so much public concern over the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from malnutrition related to smoking and smoking are NHS £2 billion a year.
By making clear the current evidence - even though e-cigarettes are not without risk, they are not just damage caused by smoking - we are filling our national competences.
BBC should end with EastEnders, former director of Channel 4
Former Director Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give his right hand" for a walk show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence fee should be used only for programs that are not created by another British television.
He criticised BBC for setting up public services programmes that would probably only be followed by a bunch of people, in complicated times to reverse its rivals "the largest rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After general director Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had failed to connect with BBC for six years, working on Channel 4.
"I fight with the idea that BBC is sending and sending programs that would certainly be sent without State contributions," Johnson said in the Committee on Communications in the Horn as part of the consultation on the future of the BBC.
If you keep the licence fees that I'm not sure whether they are in the medium or long term sound mind, you should at least reduce the creation of programmes that are not produced or implemented by others.
They send The Voice at the main time because they want to get as much support as possible in the future.
The idea that no one else would send him is a funny joke, and of course not.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why the regressive tax should support programmes that can be financed without contributions.
The voice is one of them, the EastEnders another, and of course made on domestic soil.
The other channels would give them a calm hand.
I can't understand how these public service is.
I don't think it would even weaken the BBC.
Johnson, an entrepreneur in the series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told BBC that he felt guilty that he had won ratings "because of the ambitious people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comment on the most popular BBC show repeats the former executive director Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003, to suggest that BBC sells show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even more demanding public-service programmes "come to BBC4, where almost often can't measure the promise, but they're filling their rights and can argue when they're on their cover-up mission to justify £4bn income from license fees, "But of course we're doing all these cover programs that nobody's looking at."
They send them out at a time when no one looks at them.
Regarding the licence fee, Johnson told the Commission: "I call on you to find a more regressive system with regard to who gets the best value.
Understandably, we all think that 150 British Frees are a large sum annually, but for people who are 150 Frees too much, I would be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look so much at BBC.
Former Director Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared before the Commission on Tuesday, said that BBC should review its Rehitov mission in the sense of "information, education and exercise."
He confirmed that the small amount of BBC production had already been classified as a teacher - it was 1% television production and 0.1% radio - and should be taken as a model for public transmission in Australia and Canada and change to "information, explain and practice."
On the issue of Elstein's partnership, he said that BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were only broadcast on television, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can see them online.
"Sonogenetics" or control of brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction the list moves.
Scientists have trained reds with a genetically modified nervous system that is capable of controlling sound waves.
Detailed lists change direction at a time when sound impulses are infected that are unheard of for human ears.
The pulses function so that cells pass genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists are able to read and write brain activity using light
Scientists have noted that these reds are a great indication of the new methods of somnolence, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekant Chalasani, a researcher from Salk Institute in La Jolla in California, said that this method could one day compensate for deep brain stimulation - invasive procedure where electrodes are introduced into the patient’s brain that stimulates the brain. This method is used for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Lists usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction is delivered when it is placed into a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he discovered, the bubbles strengthen ultrasound waves that then pass through the body of the reds.
Solid ultrasound waves are occurring in the iont channels TRP-4 which are located in the membranes of some red cells.
With sound waves these channels open and activate cells connected to them are reported in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control the list of ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified reds so that some of their motor neurons contain ion channels TRP-4.
Then, when he used this modified red ultrasound, sound waves were strengthened by microbublins and transferred to the reds where modified motor neurons stopped.
The new method is in many forms of optogenetics, a progenitoral tool that allows scientists to shut down and remove neurons by means of light.
Chalasani, however, let me hear that sonogenesis might have been worth a lot of benefits to this technique.
Unlike the light that must be sent by an optical train to the desired place in the brain, ultrasound waves can detect tension without restriction and be sent directly into the brain.
“We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical therapy for the treatment of neurological disabilities,” Chalasani said.
He added that his method would also be found in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture device - directly on your dust!
Inserates that are leaving the British arms trade.
Look at the video on the Amnesty International Anti-Fraud Market.
It's a dangerous killer drone!
The eyes on the legs of the knights!
Three shots!
And electric amplifiers that cause incalculable pain, but they don't stop!
The happy voice and characterization of the metaphor leave no one doubt that this advertising on the world's largest major weapons is a hard paradigm created for Amnesty International because of the British government's desire to sell weapons to the repression regimes over the defence and security of the International Veselice in ExCel Centre in the London district of Docklands.

But the campaign is also carried out by opening posters at bus stops and meters that require a different view.
"Relevant notice, Traveling to DLR from 15 to 18 September?" read one, using a letter marked by a London metro with DLR lines becomes a tank image.
This year in September, there will be a lot of dealers joining the DDR ... Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
On 300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
A collective name Special Patrol Group has helped to distribute throughout London and with "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 for Allen's turn, which will probably "be able to access up to a third of the commercial bus stop area on the planet."
Transport for London is not fun with this flightposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodys made by a collective Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindona, curator of Cruel Designs and a professional assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly suspicious and try to show political activity to fans outside the gallery.
Many artists go to work with activists in protest campaigns and realize that they have to get out in the real world in order to have their art impact on society.
Other anti-trafficking posters with metro-vehicles.
The Amnesty video was followed on Facebook by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by a VCCP agency that worked free of charge for the honorary and graphic designer and commentary.
The creative director of VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the silent advertising of arms trade - he saw an empty place in the exCel calendar - and thought, "Let's show them a campaign that's trying to avoid."
They played with the creation of more realistic risk-making commercials, but "by attaching solid colors and animations, I've been able to teach more people."
"They took a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about selling illegal torture tools on the market," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is that the United Kingdom government takes action and ensures that the torture system is not illegally traded on our market.
Almost the most creative art involving arms trade comes from within ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press report, Saab withdrew an order from the American army to "on the framework of AT4CS RS. "
This includes "a uniquely designed head which provides wonderful effects beyond the protection within the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules for life on a student college
11 years ago I moved to a student college as an unsuspecting 19-year-old boy, still believing in bars and moral relativism, but so far I am benefiting from the heavy smiles of those I led - and read about long-term difficulties on the other.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Walking on the rail can move from calm to completely clear on the nerves of the incoming one.
It's loving bluebolism: to tell people where you are from, if you took a year of rest that you're looking at Corbina and why "you don't really love or hate Marmite right now, because people, it's just an escape from the HAHA, I'll be in the room."
Deep down.
And help others to breathe too - ask yourself and show interest.
He's driving this conversation and he's gonna help you find people you like, and those you don't care about even if your lines were in a fire and they're going to turn them out.
Let's get some space.
People's rooms are often changed to drinking receptions, movies places and public places, but they are also rooms where people dress and manage their work.
Tip: Don't even think about starting to go high and being involved in the relationship
Introverts on high will be here soon.
Your room should be a shelter, although many changes to a peace-based transition culture that is friendly, social and contributing to lifelong friendship.
It can be a trap for someone who needs it.
No culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go back to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to know when a partner is forced out of socialization - and maybe write him a place to lock up.
Once it's about dressing, put it on.
One boy in my wheelchair used to say that if the door is not locked, he's invited inside.
He saw a few things.
Make friends by taking care of them.
Because you started going to college at the top of the lawn moon, closing the door and presenting with the payload of cookies seems less strange than "In the neighborhood, I've got something in your mind, now laugh while I'm going to ask myself personal questions."
Offering home visits is a good way to find friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and maybe it's all over so your face will fit into a taste of surprise.
It's of course the subject of being a decent baker.
Badly condensed tastes of butter, sugar and tea are likely to interfere with the rest of your sleep when you try to knock them out of the door.
The theft of food is on students' bicycles with the usual crime.
The theft of the whole thing is of course a crime, but is the milk cap in your tea shop a thief?
Check with the milk owner twice.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're getting scared inside.
If someone steals something, it's disgusting and you have my sympathy - but try to handle it a little bit more mature than my roommate who has changed his milk for the means of delivery so that the robbers can be punished.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't do sounds that distract people from sleeping or studying.
It's not just a decent human apartment, but you're also a historical people in locked houses.
A girl from my walk asked her neighbors if they could have a little bit of fun with the road and bass because they were 3 at night and she had a letter in the morning.
Their response was a strengthening of music.
When they finally ran out at five o'clock in the morning, she let her sleep quietly for two hours and then let her own music out, locked the door and went to her third-hour letter.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future would go on the same road as you?
And yet, wouldn't it be extremely sad if you were to visit your roommates for your future, sleep together, get divorced and have to see each other every day and maybe take control of your friends?
Of course, you don't recommend - but if your roommate sex percentage isn't your future, try talking to your weaknesses at least a little bit.
At the moment you realize that someone left the keys in his locked room, it's just a thin border between playing and skiing.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by hiding something - never spoil any room toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put your keys into their pockets with water that you can turn into ice - but never throw their things on their heads more than twice.
Eva was both happy, despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva's been through a rough time in pregnancy with a seven-year-old widow.
His dad broke up with her, and he was on his own for training and training.
With the situation, I got along quite fast - I was very happy with the child and I was looking for a positive one.
I'm not sure, and since I'm with the child myself, I've tried not to touch it.
And I'm sure I had hope that we won't be alone for a long time today, remembering Eva on her first pregnancy.
She was already on the Internet with an older Vaska chat who started to talk to her about favorite movies.
Your Evu and Vitek even brought home from the family, but he didn't care too much about his own father's role.
"Some time later he got out of the program," said Eva in the documentary series Four in that 3.
The motive of the third series of Czech TV series is just looking for luck on second try.
The care of Vítka and the family’s financial security enabled her to work part-time and with great help from her mother and aunt.
Not even views of responsibility for a foreign child finally showed your devotion to Eve.
They definitely gave themselves together around the Second Births and this understanding of Uska as his father and also celebrates him.
Even though your father has two grown daughters, in his 60 ’ s the father is enjoying himself, and the children are more responsible.
In addition to Vítka, Leontýk's two-year-old daughter and her two-year-old daughter came to him.
"Our family has been so naturally influenced by you, perhaps even by my mother never talked too much to me about relationships," Eva says smiling.
A little place?
At least we're close.
Both Emma and Ella were born with a cesarean cut after Evé was diagnosed with a pregnancy.
This is an increase in the production and activity of yellow acids, which are then excreted in excess of fat in the blood and are particularly evidence.
Disease is dangerous for an unborn child, which is threatened by premature birth and death, most of which are self-responsive in mothers after birth.
Emma and Ella were born healthy to Evina and Vask's happiness, even though they were only on week 36.
They put the emigrant into the incubator at an intermediate department, where he also works on the Vashkov network, which was able to take over and stay.
Elika was older and immediately after transporting the JIP to the room I had her, she describes the order period after Eva's birth.
In the family she spent 20 days until the doctors refused to leave the mine, which she managed to reach a limit of two miles.
Waiting for children to be raised in Eve’s family was not happy, but it did not.
"I've been mad at my wife and children," she recalls at a difficult moment on the six-week separation of a four-year-old mother.
She also took into consideration the signing of the reverse, including because of the unfeeling approach of one of the doctors.
But finally it didn't come, and the doctors missed Eve and both of them at home.
During four pregnancys and births, the CHT1 sent on Tuesday night at 21:45 p.m.
The entire family is able to soften.
They live together in a small village near Prague, where Eva had to cope with electrical doubles and forced conditions.
The home didn't grow up, but you made Eve happy by installing a gas heater so that she could prepare food for six more comfortable people.
If it's not clear, we'll agree on the taxi.
Eva is convinced that children are particularly concerned about the family environment and the pleasant atmosphere, not about the size or size of the home.
In the past, we've been doing a lot better than we've been waiting for.
The mess is hiding up in a small space and we're always going through the minima, but at least we're all close to each other, Eva smiles that can find a positive page in any situation.
Your work of lighting in the film is not a guarantee of regular revenue.
That's why he sometimes goes to the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
In his 60s, according to his words, family finances and children physically control how long will it be?
"I realize that because of our age difference, it will be me who will live this family once," admits Eva at the level when she asks about the future.
I'd like her to go back to work, but she's even more interested in the possibility of her own business.
I'm not with four children for employees.
And when it gets worse, we can talk to my husband about the taxi, she's wearing a sympathetic blonde.
Apple post-io effect.
They can show up for everything.
The most effective processor, phototape with greater resolution, stronger chassis or display of the detecting power of touch are the briefs of the recently presented iPhones nine generations.
The last two also have a negative impact on the size and weight of the iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
However, the current trend in Apple was that every new generation of iPhone is easier than it was before.
Except for the third and fourth generations whose weight was gradually increased by the previous iPhones.
The bi-grammatical weight of the difference in the disadvantages of the news, however, has been quite dissociable.
But it doesn't pay for new iPhones far away.
In contrast to the London iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight increased in a smaller model of 14 grams, then a larger of 20 grams.
On the one hand, it is not surprising that the long-distance affair in Apple's pockets has been used a lot.
The sixth newspaper is so from the most distant halves of 7000, which has also been lost to weight.
But they have a lot more impact on her.
Apple has also used 3D Touch technology in the news, thanks to the display's different power of touch.
To that end, there was a need to monitor another type of capacity sensors.
The number of new iPhones displays thus reversing the previous generation has increased more than twice.
In less iPhone than 12 grams per 29 grams, in case of greater than 19 grams per 40 grams.
iPhone 6s is the most difficult component used.
The volume of only 143 grams is then achieved in this paper by means of the withdrawal curve that affects most of the remaining components.
In the larger model, however, it is the hardest battery used, but its weight has not changed in any way.
Even in this case, the largest growth is just the opposite of the display.
The 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus so reaches 192 grams.
As much as the new technology will show up is practical, it will show up when it is used.
The first users will be able to test this by Friday 25 September when the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus sales are started in selected countries.
Are the trains on the morning of the champions tens of thousands of years ago?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists have found an interesting opportunity.
There have been rates of exposure to modern man from different times, including walled furniture, tools and so on and so on.
In kind 23A, which is based on tools dated to the period 30 thousand years before the drought, scientists have discovered something very significant about the rest of the breakfast buffet.
Instead, there were also stages of iron ions, which apparently passed through the production process of such popular fibers today.
She's going to go to her first place today, then dry up, get rid of the lake, so it's a pupch, then she's drying up, and then she's gonna get out of there.
In the Panlicca lake it was possible to reveal a grain that was planted or burned according to the whole arrangement, and then apparently split between the two small stones - at least it testifies to the use of two stones in the lake.
Scientists have therefore failed in their PNAS magazine publication to point out that the complete process of production of flakes would take place in the oven, but the similarity is really very ideal.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat the trains, but the idea that it was with some liquid and maybe even the heat, of course, is quite logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting evidence of how intensive people have used crops long before agricultural production.
If the interpretation of the vowel is correct, the oldest vowels have preceded agriculture for twenty thousand years.
A new report of the state in the City of Brna.
So I was once again employed to report the name of the stop in the trolleybus: Hnusáčkova, Prizrak, Frazova, Spratecká.
Of course, the troleibus was somewhat more critical, so the men's voices were somewhat less understandable than they had before when the stops were voted by the women's voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper wave of transport movement it is more noticeable than in the deeper male voice.
The DPMB network argues that these voters have chosen themselves as travellers - I don't know who asked me, but they certainly chose from the studio recordings made in simple silence, which they obviously knew quite differently from the bus engine.
I live in Brná for a few decades, so I know the correct names of all these stops, so I don't need this report, but foreigners who are not known in Brná and for whom this report is first appointed may be confused and may be at the end where they were wrong, then claim that the stop to which they were to issue has not been reported at all.
Perhaps this choice of voters - but better to repeat voters - should be done again, and this time subcoloured by the usual transport noise and engine bill, where the sound of the player in the bus is almost lost.
So that we don't want to keep listening to the names of the Water Herspice, Shmírov, or then Ponorna in the squeaking side that I've stepped into in Komárva.
I guess my old hearing didn't get worse right away during the one day when the voter changed.
That day I understood the report quite well.
Good morning, I agree with the chief.
It's from the trajectory records.
Today, little people know what the biggest and smartest of the governments were called complex checks.
I let you remember that.
The bus was late.
I went to the D.C.'s office right away when the radio reported it was about seven hours ago.
"You're lucky you didn't break up with your co-founder, came in a minute before you, and it doesn't seem like he's got a right mood," noted the speaker, while I was writing to the income book.
Thank you, I'll give you a kiss.
You're writing me that I'm going to go through the circuits to review the little mechanism.
This isn't going to happen. Today, there are checks.
They're all out of shit when they're threatened.
What's this about?
"But you'll see," the dissembled speaker.
You'll be next, too.
I ran away on my walk.
However, the door of the principal was opened and the principal appeared.
Well, he's got a stone face in perfect uniform.
"Good morning, Mr. President," I said frankly and quickly shut down two keys of the same time.
"Good morning," she called out, and I ran into the second floor without realizing the cold, violent tone the old man had answered.
"You're playing," said engineer Eva, the older lady I cared about very much.
She was even more of a leader than her peers had.
They're checkbooks and you're gonna get a cab.
How many times have I asked myself what these complex checks are, but no one wants to talk about it too much.
They've been there once in three years, they've all got to go to it, and it's pretty unpleasant.
At least for some.
But I'll see you soon.
I got rid of my dirty fascicle with periodicals and my cell phone.
"Here Holcman, come to me now," called the chief's voice.
What's going on?
Now we met and nothing... I'm confused, but nobody answered me, everyone just with their thoughts.
"Good morning, the chief's board, I've come to your order," I complained, I barely got into the principal's office.
The headmaster sat behind the dog's table and looked at some leaves.
"The mechanic's judge," he went for a while without raising his head, and still carefully looked at it, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He left his desk on the table, turned around in the back seat, and looked at me with an ordinary, unpleasant, bad look.
I've got it.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the mayor commended me for working very well for the few months and for being very comfortable with me.
That the boss did a lot of good when he pulled me out of a distance.
And now this?
I'll know you're a road distance technician and you have to act on it.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I was shocked that I used such a greeting from childhood that I was so raised and I didn't see anything wrong with it.
It was like a red hat on a crocane.
"You're on a socialist train and the only welcome welcome is the privilege of work," said the quoted chief.
And also, you're still complaining about the words of the superiors.
You're gonna say "Lord" once and again "the neighbor."
Well, I'm not a leader for you, but a leader for you.
The tenants are customers' friends, the top trammers are top trammers' partners!
Remember that kindly!
I'm sorry, Mr.... I'm sorry to the Chief, but... but I've welcomed you to the ordinary public.
There's nothing wrong with it... and it's the honor of a job or of a fellow... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your privilege that you're not in the other side," said the headmaster who calmed down a bit.
But it's still going to be about it.
Anyway, remember, you don't have any money to pay for up here.
That wasn't good.
When the boss told someone that something wasn't his priority, it didn't look good about it.
For a while he was trying to get me into a cold, dirty look, and I was looking for words I'd answer.
I was also impressed by his elevated looks.
He was just a couple of years older and played on the Lord's Day, actually a fellow man.
He's jealous, distracted, authoritarian, arrogant, as he's doing right now.
He's all fired.
Wake up, he's the boss.
In fact, not everyone, the president of the party organization, like all parties, but also non-residents, spoke.
But the chief spoke to many, especially those in whom he could exercise his authority.
Right now he set me up for a full cow.
I thought something about my ass, and I kept getting pretty upset so I wouldn't shoot him in the face.
That's why I wouldn't even go back to the dumpster so I could keep doing a nice officer.
What would I like to have two kids?
And a broken bar!
I was in trouble, but I was in control.
I'm not doing him any pleasure here.
"That's still everything you can go," said the headmaster's audience and began to look back clearly on the sheet that he had before in his hand.
They called me in the middle of the 12th.
All of them from the office were already there and asked questions about what and how, they answered, yes, it would be fine.
Only Jožin carefully observed his habit of not all of us getting upset because he had to do this work together with his own faithful ones, and that does not put him in danger.
He emphasized the word "counsel" as if he knew what my old man had done for me in the morning.
There was a nice coincidence in the main.
The Chief of Staff at his dog's table and at the long advisory table were other associates who were to decide whether to be my official residence or not.
Kádrávák, President of the ROH, a personal secretary, a rapporteur for special purposes, something in a way contrary to the war, and my mayor, my boss.
And the most important person, the president of the party organisation.
I knew him from the street.
A common trajectory worker, killed a pig or seen by a shark shark.
But it was also an ex-boyfriend.
It turned out there was no fun with him this time, no nice animal.
Bad language claimed that he went to school in the seventh grade, he didn't learn anything, he didn't know anything.
And when the crime broke down, he ended up in a dumpster.
But the team, it was, the team was hit!
The chief ordered me to sit down.
There was a little baby in me, a baby in the neck that was unstoppable.
The Cádrovák read a sentence from the Citizen Committee from the place of residence.
I'm from a working family, I'm married, two children and so on and so on.
I've been thinking about it before, and I've been feeling a little better.
Then the trial from the party's street organization.
The judge who copied the case from the civil court was probably the same person.
That's what happened!
The parents of the long-term members refused to deliver before the audit committee and subsequently appeared from the parties, possibly for health reasons.
The chief looked very closely at me.
He noticed it and stopped reading.
The Chief said he'd keep going.
He was just getting worse.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee, and I was appointed as a candidate for the party.
Regardless of the parents who showed up on the side, the side gave me confidence.
So I got married and had a wedding in addition to a national committee.
I lied to the party's trust in the worst way.
That's why I was fired from a number of her candidates.
But that's not enough!
I left both children to be baptized, and even when Mother died, I built a church funeral even though it was a former member of the party.
So I'm giving all of this the most negative position towards the leading role of the party.
When the cadre was read, only pouring the main load into the table was interrupted by the drunk silence.
Everyone looked at me carefully, and I was hoping I'd be far away.
And I kept repeating in my mind, "Communicatives, Communists, Censors." To what did I get?
Why didn't I just stay in the bathroom?
I could fix the escapes without any separate checks.
But now?
A lovely officer's career took place before she started.
Back to read?
I don't think it's going to work. I'm sure the boss's gonna show me in an hour.
"How did you check out the ordered judge?" interrupted the silent head of the cadre question.
Well, according to the report from the previous employment.
You got him here?
It wasn't obvious that the cameraman wasn't too many times.
On the cover of the bridge, he was nervous as if he were checking himself.
Horrively he picked up and gave the boss some paper.
"Well," he said with a sign of jealousy, which was often too much of a storm.
At first sight, he praised himself, studied the industry, worked as a depositary, and met the standard by a percentage of twenty per cent.
It's just the basics.
From where did you take that sentence, the judge?" He turned to the framer who felt that it was starting to turn against him and that he would probably not be a framer very soon.
This is where my team gave it to me when I arrived.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came up to us, he went up to the top of the stairs," the black box said.
And there's no need for the supplies. That was his jacket, too, so I gave it to him in the box.
"So this paper card was sufficient for you when you entered the technical function," said the chief.
The guard was nervous and had no response.
"It's all right, we'll do it later," concluded the chief's concern and the cadrovars were clearly relieved.
He got up last time.
"So what about you, mate?" the chief turned to me again.
I'll be right there. It's over!
In my eyes, I was burned with anger.
He followed a lecture and a charge, and I knew that I was the most powerful creature in the world who doesn't deserve self-defense.
With the support of the incomplete trial, I put in the error of the panel rapporteur's court, which I did not understand why the trial was incomplete when I got it from the camera in the factory.
I am also an antisocialist living that supports the zeal of religious torture during the construction of real socialism, or even participates in it.
The fact is, it was a lot of things I've been sleeping for, or maybe I'm still sleeping and I've prayed for it to end.
It was all my fault.
I was wondering if I could get out of the mechanic's place.
I thought they'd take me with that cuff.
It's work for honest and obedient people, not for the enemies of the people I was in the eyes of the judge.
"That's enough, Mr. President," the chairman of the party called out immediately and seriously interrupted the principal's levies.
This is where the team made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he's just done the stupid thing!
He's already got his punishment!
Don't forget that, Your Honor!
What could be worse for a young man than to close the door to his side in time!
To open it again, he'll have to prove that he's changed that it's time to trust us again.
The uneducated priest spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he so smart or he's been looking for phrases from party training and he's coming?
That's why this young team must also get a chance from us!
Chances to prove he's changed.
And who's going to give it to him if you're not exactly the judge?
It is your duty to support this young man, the truth, some mistaken fellow, in his efforts to reform!
It's your foreign duty that no one will ever release you!
In fact, it's a foreign duty for all of us.
There's got to be a team here that didn't forget about him.
Like a kind mother, she's not only punished, but also loved.
When the president's done, no one even answered.
No one ever expected such a thing.
At least I do.
"I agree with you, the President-in-Office," the chairman kindly urged in an attempt to resume the initiative.
If you'd let me talk, you'd have heard that I'd be heading for such a conclusion.
All were moved to tears in their eyes, but they could see that they did not even believe his word.
"That's how I was confirmed for the role of a self-responsive rapporteur of basic resources," I got back to the office, and I broke up.
Besides Evy's engineers, they were all on lunch.
That silence listened to my inconsistencies of pure experiences, and I calmed down.
When I finished, she asked if I could have a coffee.
When she didn't wait for the answer, she put the water on the fire and she picked up the shelves.
In the meantime, she talked about cadromatic practices.
As one court, often full of praise, they give the man a hand, and the other, where there is a spy, sends a new employee.
Well, I didn't end up where I was, but on the street in the trunk, so the company from the factory didn't know where they were supposed to send it.
What about our camera?
That's where he's going to eat or drink, and finally it's what it's like.
"That's from the old shot," she said.
He's definitely not gonna smell today.
Still, take care of him. He's too soft.
What about the party president?
In general, it's a far worse leader, no limudile.
A zero from a pumpkin with great power.
The coffee water began to flow and the office was filled with freshly baked coffee.
I went into the sugar cane, and the milk had a hot liqueur.
I think I'm from the worst outside.
I'm not going out now and the other checks are up to three years.
Anyway, I just don't forget my boss's team today.
Efficacy of LITERATI ON TREATY II in the possession of EPIKA
The symbol of the beast survived.
Around the windshield over Chlum again after years.
It's seen far because it's located at 15 meters high.
People from around the world call him "the wind on the chlum."
For the population, 150 people even became one of the elements of the general sign which the municipality received for the 2010 parent race.
"We then asked for a sign and the wind on a sign, of course we wanted to have, known it around everyone," observed the old man Jiři Masek.
The chlumsian windshield is a local technical memory.
It's a little bit of a measure of modernity: it reminds us of the time when people fought for quality drinking water.
That in Chlum in the past centuries has been an act of loyalty.
By 1910 the clumns were decided to resolve which then lasted up to half of the 1980s.
In the village of the village of Chichov, they were allowed to dig up a seven - foot - long [7 m] deep well.
Three years later, the study was completed by a metal structure with a wind pump that drew water into a reservoir in the highest point of town near the building.
"The building was carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranic on Moravia at a cost of 2,400 koruna," says the memorial note on the ground floor building.
Several repairs and damage to the windmill were performed in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter on water began to be written: that day in Chluma, he began to serve as a new guide.
The windshield has already remained only a non-functional current symbol and more rare.
The Dominant was conducted during the annual parenting race.
By 2008, Chlumšta decided that the wind bike would be repaired and re-launched.
They were allowed to make the original car trailer - reduced to half a meter.
The circle was mounted on a guard, but it still had to be cut down in the same year.
However, the Replica manufacturer did not choose the appropriate material and could not cause wind disturbances.
Then the chlumsy dominant had been resting under the roof for several years.
Since June of this year, however, the bicycle is again on the high guard.
On the occasion of the family’s race, the owner let the car refurbish and reassembled it to the top of the railway line.
But it's only a circle of useful water from the spring into a transparent dark frame.
And over the years, we completely abandoned him because there was little water in the studio.
At least it went forward.
"Then on the floor of the windshield, we'll rewind again," explained the old Mashek.
Chlum is not the only town in Česka where the wind cycle reached the general sign, however, is the only one of these species throughout the universe.
A similar feature in the mark is in respect of local technical monuments such as Chvalkovic and Green Mountains in Vyškovsk, Küželov in Hodoninsk, Partutovic in Vsetinsk or in the police in Vsetinsk.
Nothing bad, but I don't know Lafata, she confessed to the defense of Tripoli Goian.
"The match against Slavia I remember very well, and my head like everyone in my career," said 34-year-old Goian at a press conference.
That time George Hagi trained us, it was a shame we lost.
I hope I'll give the ball to Sparta right now.
Only with this difference that we won't win this time," Goian continued.
Just this man who won 60 rounds for Romanian representation is the key defense of the Greek team.
As a stopper, he's going to face his partner's offenses.
There's a few thousand people coming, no hell, says about the Greek file by the partner Hybš.
And partly he finds out what he can wait for on Thursday night.
I know Fataie who played in Romanian Astre with my brother Lucia.
At the time, I saw all their savings.
I know it's a very good attacker, so he went to Sparty, said Goian.
Another football player named the Prague Club, and that's the direct question whether he knew David Lafata, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Captain Sparty.
Goian smiled, and with a simple read-only look, he directed his attention to the Czech journalist.
He said, "Why are you asking me about it?"
After a minute of silence, he dropped it.
We've seen some videos and I've noticed that Sparta plays a lot of team.
He's got a really good player.
What About Laphata?
It's okay, but I don't know anyone else than Fatai.
It's about Goian who knows very well.
"My experience in larger clubs can be said to hold Asterus' defence, it's such an organizer of their games," remarked partner assistant Stanislav Haykal.
Goian's got the best summers behind him, but he can enjoy a very interesting football life.
In his time, he was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchesterers United and City, from Steauy, but he was also interested in Italian Palermo, playing for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a large team, playing European games regularly, spending on winning in Czech league.
For me, this game is a favorite game, but we play home and want to start the group with a good outcome.
Like Sparta we're gonna try to win, Goian said.
I'm in the room with the Slovenian banker Tomáš Košick, who is very happy about the opposition from Česka.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola moves from Poland to Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Castle.
The new seat should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading with the shares of the firm on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have a group seat in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken in the course of the project are mostly legal and administrative and have no actual impact on actions in society, says Daniel Buryš, financial director of the Kofola group.
"As regards the movement of the seat of the group of shareholders, the location of the shares on the Prague Exchange is considered."
As a result of the entry into the Prague Stock Exchange, the company completes the prospectus of the securities, which is presented by the Czech National Bank as soon as possible for approval.
The movement of holding seats and related transfers of shares will be carried out in the form of non-public transactions by sharing only existing shareholders.
No public or new investors will be offered under this operation.
"The offer of action to new investors would be carried out - so the company and its shareholders will decide - later, either on Thursday 4th 2015 or on 1st Thursday 2016," the company said.
The company has already indicated in the past that the appropriate offer of action could be derived from the emission of new shares or sales of existing shares.
This offer could be based on the offer of action on the bridge in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of the share on the Warsaw bridge.
Test of Czech TV objectivity in information on the migration crisis.
A further small test of the objectivity and balance of the reporting of the main Czech media on the outbreak of the crisis.
This time sending the main reporting relationship of Czech TV.
How'd it go?
When studying how the media can manipulate the reality at a university of journalism, they can allow today's Czech TV to be sent to the event.
The migration crisis was attributed to approximately 80% of the reporting.
By the first minute, when the CT informed about the disturbances at the Serbian-Major border and the attacks of migrants on the police called them euphemytic boredom - stones miners and victims of war), the current pro-immigrants propaganda - has already given its own names of individual reports.
Critics of non-governmental organizations - a large area for non-profit organisations that criticise ill-treatment with migrants.
Syrian children in Czech school - the history of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
The fugitives are not only as a threat but also as a chance.
Traveling refugees - CT consistently uses expressions of refugees or refugees rather than migrants.
It is a major concern that the TC in the illustration shows that only small children and women are used in constant use.
In addition, in the same communication it stated that 80% of the migrants in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: Most of the propaganda that has no periods of communist activity.
I have to say I'm ashamed to be a former journalist.
Ecology in practice.
When I was able to stay on the panel, I soon stopped being the only citizen.
I was moved to the bottom of the map.
The domestic fish, hemisphere with a change of imperfect, i.e., the growing one generation from the nest to the broccoli and the young looks like a grown-up unit, only small and gradually growing.
I've been opposed, and I haven't lost them.
First hand and later chemically.
The socialist drugs on their liquidation provided some fresh crystals.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
However, it has been successful.
Later, I solved this with Pharaoh.
The Krabic with some juvenile hunters who brought themselves into the nest and then he refused to royally produce a new generation.
But I rejected it.
As time went by, he also became the subject of my surprise, and I became increasingly convinced that they had the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I have come from life with the experience that getting into the ecosystem does not lead to success, and one of the damages can be rewarded by another.
The truth is, I don't think I'd be able to make it worse by killing them.
In our new apartment, we agreed with our partner that if we don't get fish for the cow, we're gonna have to eat some of these invisible lines and something like that.
Their quiet existence in time broke down the roof.
It was a typical kind of waitress who had been sitting on the floor for a long time.
We were meant to live from temporary mice and cameras, which only increased our comfort.
Because he lived with us for several years, we found that he was mostly living with fishermen and that his number was apparently kept on an external figure.
With reliable regular contact, we found out that it was a personal need.
We were the witnesses of romantic talks with a partner about about a third less, as carefully as a flash on the train of wings so that he would not be caught before he reached the exhausted couple.
It took about three days when they didn't move and didn't respond to our controls.
Under the western table where the friendly toys were played, we later found the remains of the frozen single.
Then he didn't even wake up for a long week.
When we thought it was already behind us, we were surprised by the number of small spiders growing in its environment.
They're gone soon.
They were eaten by their mother, they were divorced by others.
Even a kid disappeared a week later.
If she left or disappeared, we don't know, but after a month, two, she appeared on the floor again.
It's true, a little less, probably the daughter of those westerners.
For some time, she watched our conduct from the platform and, by moving under the western table, assessed our lack of association as friendship.
A number of these fish were again reduced and the spider was quietly looking for its usual activities to ensure food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed for the whole year.
Our daughter grew up in the middle of the night when the use of the night was already out of her mind.
So far we've tolerated it, but we've already eaten its contents forever.
We've made her more and more aware of the use of the bathroom.
However, the daughter found an excuse to keep her habit in the pavour she saw very well when she was beaten.
Our words about seeing the spider, the happiness in the house, she didn't even know.
I cried and cried. I threw myself out of my nightlife.
It wasn't too much.
It was the time when he had to marry his stepfather, in the interest of his daughter's developmental estate.
It happened to me.
He was dragged into the castle and showed up through the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I used to laugh with him like a friend, but after so long a long time I felt embarrassed as if I were exaggerating the subject.
We assumed that fishermen would start to reveal more often and to multiply the geometric order.
The world's wild, week, two, we didn't find out.
I started speculating about the reason.
I was wondering if there's this spider behind the mural pattern somehow that the middle of the west isn't as sensitive to their existence as we thought it would be.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they were already faked.
I had to figure out another theory about why they disappeared, and I came to see that their relationship to the flag had to be the reason that if he didn't see him hiding somewhere else and that he threatened them anywhere.
Or maybe they had some telepathic connection with their provider and his rapid disappearance in them caused some alarming reaction.
You know, I don't do any illusions about their air.
Some light showed kindness, but that they would react to having a hand or a quick move, it wasn't.
The daughter's going to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's forgotten about the night.
There's only one thing left to touch.
I've already sent my invitation to the restaurant and I hope they didn't trust me after the execution.
Otherwise we should use this Cyclone B.
The destruction of Albert Einstein's products that enriched the world.
The products of a genius scientist from the past century seem to never cease to fascinate mankind.
He proved to be so deeply offended that the result was always a shocking discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
In the minds of humans, he was primarily aware of his special and general theory of relativity, which describes the universe in its huge proportions.
It cannot also mention its explanation of the photo effect or thought of quantification of the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the self-responsive description and concept of popular relativity theory is so common to many that for closer identification, it prefers simple examples.
But it's not easy.
It wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't find a brilliantly simplified way of explaining: The clock near your dear looks like a minute; the minute in the hot sand seems an hour - and that's relative.
I've allowed himself to choose from his whole lungs the famous quotes of these ten who took me literally.
Intelligent people are trying to solve problems, the genius is trying not to do them.
Only two things are endless.
The universe is a human fool.
I'm not so sure about that first one.
No amount of effort can ever prove that I had the truth.
But the only time he can prove I've been wrong.
But it's a sad period when it's easier to break atoms than to destroy the universe.
If an irregularity on the table reflects an irregularity in the sense of what does an empty table reflect?
I don't know what it's gonna be fighting in the third world war, but in the fourth, it's gonna be cracks and rocks.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but there's no way to wake it up.
Knowing is a little dangerous and knowing a lot too.
If I had an hour to deal with a problem that would affect my life, I would spend 40 minutes with his study, 15 minutes with his analysis and 5 minutes with his solution.
The hardest thing in the world to understand income tax.
Finally, I can't give up Einstein's formula to define success: If we take A for success, it pays for the example: A=X+Y+Z where X is work, Y rest and Z is to keep language for teeth.
It's new to modern.
Hospitals in the Zlinska country are expected to change by 1.5 billion.
"It's a success when we consider that all four of them are kept in black numbers all year long," he said quietly, "Stanislav Misák.
The total profit of national installations is now about 32 million koruna.
The share in this is mainly higher than insurers, which are equally profitable for the year.
This fact also shows that in poor years hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Croatia, Vssetina, the Uhersk Hrodist and Zlína, this is due to buildings that will total approximately 1.5 billion crowns.
The long period when we bought the main equipment was over.
Now we have to start setting up new buildings because without them there is no special health care, the plans for the Lubomír Nečas national health centre have been justified.
It's good to see you change in all hospitals.
They'll be in the hospital next year.
At Vsetin, the suppliers of the new inner pavilion are now choosing nearly 300 million crowns.
They have a planned exposure to dialysis in Croatia.
The Uhersk Kradista wants to set up a new interior for a total of 200 million to the opened central palace this year.
And Bajyn Bajó's hospital is waiting for a long-standing construction of a new central income and an internal one that will require three fourths of a billion.
In all cases, there is a major and often major change in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors are an extremely important step," she said, for example, to build the internal director of the Hospital of Faith Prousková.
The five-storey building has to be ready for two years and offers comfortable equipment for internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulance, bed and intensive care unit.
More comfort for patients.
Changes that are well-known to patients in particular will affect all regions.
New buildings are also rewarded by those who, for example, have many patients in one room, have only one toilet on the floor, beds are inadequate, windows are unstable and doctors do not have adequate working conditions.
"For example, our home was established 50 years ago and now it is at the border of its life," pointed to the director of criminal hospital Pavel Calábek.
For several years therefore, it is rewarded by a seven-story modern building combined with an emergency income.
Doctors and patients will have all acute divisions in one place, including in new areas.
The same model already has half of the Uhersky Garden.
The central reception is already in place, and within three years he will be brought in.
"We will pay for the building from credit and partly from our own resources," explained Director Petr Sládek.
This hospital can only afford its own funding in the country.
The profit is still the highest and has not reached the loss even two years ago when a vicious hospital had to deal with almost twenty million losses.
"We have good insurance contracts, excellent performance, increase income and manage costs in the entire hospital," Vlastimil Widák, who has an elderly economy, said.
Improvements are also expected for patients in the chrometric hospital.
During the 10 to fifteen years it's going to fix new equipment and reconstruction up to half a billion crowns.
This year it will be ready to repair the roofing station and then start the construction of the slide, if possible, building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one explained to me how I should keep accepted refugees in the country if they don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
Minister inside Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) after meeting with his European colleagues, complains that the other Czech States are pushing for a quota to be taken to redefine refugees, but any discussions they refuse.
It is also true that no one has ever explained to him how the assigned refugees in the Czech Republic should stay when they do not want to live with us at the same time.
"We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec told journalists.
Can you describe more specifically the positions you came up with in-house and foreign ministers of the European Union?
We don't agree with mandatory quotas like a system that just can't work.
We can't talk about migrants like fat salts or nuts.
They're living habitats that have some vision, they're heading somewhere, they're having some kind of adventure.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we were able to maintain migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were redistributiond.
We can't imagine it.
We didn't get the answer, so we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, therefore registration sites, border protection, camps outside Europe, African country trust fund and other things, we have no problem with this.
We've been talking about it for years and we've been saying that this is the way.
But to say the quotas will solve everything?
We've just solved forty-four thousand, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep those people on this land?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
We don't want almost anyone, we just don't know how to keep them here.
We have ambitions to go to other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a target country, get asylum with us, but interest in people from this migration valley, then from Syria and other countries, is extremely close to zero.
You mentioned that the refugees don't even want us, but we've already made a commitment to accept 15 people.
Would it not be possible for them to take this road any more?
We made a commitment to take 1500 people, but on condition.
We said functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
Even in the 1500s, there's going to be 1100 people with whom we'll handle the asylum procedure.
They'll come into our detention facility and we'll treat them the same as those we've captured.
It is a big question, and we will discuss it with Europe if we can keep people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, as far as Hungary.
Because Europe is acting in such a way that if there are registrations, they cannot be held.
This means they'll come to our territory with registration, and if there's an agreement that isn't yet, it can happen that we won't even have 1100 on the territory of the Czech Republic and they'll go back to Germany.
If we are able to maintain them after the asylum procedure, we will conduct an asylum procedure with them.
If this will be done by citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 per cent of the European statistics will be obtained by international protection.
Then they will receive evidence that will allow them to travel across Europe.
And I think these people are going to end again in the target countries.
Then there are four people who will be moved.
This is a second project that is already under way, and we have only made progress in discussing with the churches the possibility of helping them get employment, housing and so on.
But it's a long run.
You said that the other states were not willing to discuss the meeting with the ministers.
It's not, however, that the Czech Republic just refuses the quotas, but does it not offer any solidarity step that would block the debate?
And what exactly is this supposed to be a solidarity step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany rejects the offer that all migrants from Syria can come to it, this report is spread in several hours after all camps throughout Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It's gonna be another migration wave that leads to Germany because they don't want us.
We think the road is the protection of external borders - just the migration waves to select, help the necessary, and separate economic migrants.
Just let them know they don't have a chance.
Only in a long year did tens of thousands of Kosovo arrive in Germany.
From safe Kosovo, where we pay all the State's taxes, including police, courts, state representations.
If we were able to separate them and not accept them or accept them only as economic requirements, those 50% of what social systems are dealing with today could go to refugees.
On the contrary, on the first day that Germany entered into control, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic decreased.
Now it's eighty, the first day it was twelve.
Where's it going to come from so that the border controls are still in progress?
We were afraid of getting caught in a lot of people.
These are the numbers we're dealing with.
We still have a few hundred free places in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we're holding will be returning to Rakouska within seven days.
We're doing it standard.
They are the only ones who take us with them, with Hungary, it is complex and Greek - it is absolutely a story.
So where's that bad point?
Should it be a thousand a day?
I think it should be a few hundred a day.
Two cities, three are people every day two, three in the next days, have enough capacity for crisis plans to come up.
Then I agreed with Mr. Prime Minister to call an extraordinary government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're several times a day in a phone call.
If this situation has occurred, the government can sit down immediately and decide to strengthen the army police, let us give it to the customs administration, if any, of the prison service.
The country variant is an exceptional position that has now been declared by Hungary in some places?
I don't think it can come to us that far.
Be aware that our position is different, we are national states within Europe, we have only the Schengen border and only on airports.
I don't know what should happen in order for this to happen in the territory of the Czech Republic to happen, I don't want to spread scary information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, is evidenced by the fact that Hungary is trying to withdraw the migration flows to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean the direct route to Rakouska.
The Czech Republic would be affected very strictly, almost at all.
Slavia paid a lot of debts for the last time.
He's trying to prevent the report from falling.
The football slave paid debts.
The footballers were waiting for their money.
Slavia's football took place in the morning for the first time because of the insolvency proceedings before the court.
Nearly three months later, because of its collapse of 20 million koruna, the company's online Services from the Pacific Samoa proposed.
The legal representative of Slavie Zuzana Mladkov tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzl within a few hours that he did not have to report an accident.
And I need to say she had the arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week the new owner of Slavia became a large Chinese industry and investment group CEFC and also the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáná.
Obviously, from new owners to the club they got money, and that's the last time.
This also proves that Slavian's statement before the trial tomorrow - a top club on Monday, just the day before the trial, sent a debt of tens of millions of crowns.
"It was all between September 11th and September 15th," stated the legal representative of Slavia Mádková.
Who's Slavia paying for?
Modern players and business partners.
In particular, for example, the Slovenian representative of Milan Ivanov or the Czech founder of Mariu Lickov.
Slavia has also paid a fee to Agent Alexander Losenicke.
He has already paid off on Friday at the club and paid off his debts in the city of Praha 10.
The parties to the insolvency dispute thus remain de facto only the searchers that Slavie dissembles.
Either the club has failed to comply with the obligations, or they are brought to trial.
However, we are prepared to pay the amount in the event of the loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary resources on a bank account, which we can post from the account," said Judge Mádková.
"All that was after payment is rewarded," announced Mádk and added that they are only unpaid or disbursed commitments.
It is also true that in the next few days the court will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavii three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid the above-mentioned debts.
Next comes the assessment of all the evidence.
The decision can therefore be expected first in November.
The Court ordered further proceedings on the third November.
However, no decision will be taken at this meeting, but in writing.

FastMig X is the most recent generation of investors' matching resources.
The combination of spy technologies, hardware and software equipment integrated into modular design brings benefits and rapid return of investment in high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final system is always configured according to customer requirements.
And that's whatever, from the mixing of construction steel after the mixing of special slytins, as well as from the mixing of raw materials after the mixing of thin plates, from the application in parts to the mixing in ships.
The incredible amount of corrosive corrosion, simple configuration and expansion of the corrosion source enables quick response to changes in requirements leading to reductions in space, the need to stop the source and the more productive merger.
FastMig X enables the collection of spicy blending processes developed by Kemppi, which ensures higher productivity and quality of mixing.
It ceases to waste time and does not come to waste material or repair miswarranted conflicts.
It's guaranteed flexibility, it's less simple, more competition and higher profits.
It's an annual newspaper that had a prime minister in Nitre where she also got gold medals.
We take these poems very seriously because they confirm the exception of the product.
The world's leading manufacturers can agree with similar systems, but thanks to differences in software and settings, FastMig X belongs to the world's spy.
For the interested parties, there is no doubt an additional period of time that is moving around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already mentioned the first contacts that are likely to expand beyond the brown market.
We have been his regular participants for over 20 years and almost always have our business results better than before, highlighting the company ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, leading Kemppi sales in Plzni.

White went to put it so she wouldn't fall.
But it's still about half a billion more, says an expert from the company that's projecting the tunnel.
The white guy's gone a lot safer, says the expert.
The Blanca tunnel complex was possible in order not to create two explosions of land in Prague Stream, says the manufacturer of Satra, the main projector of the tunnel, Alexander Butovic.
He said it in the middle of the afternoon at the news station.
But he thinks it's about half a billion crowns more expensive.
The drivers are open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel went back safer, but the costs grew exponentially," Butovic said.
The conditions in Stromovca were the same throughout the period, although the country was only a few steps from where it started to build a safer and more cautious approach.
"If this measure were used 500 metres earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive," Butovic said.
The White tunnel fell three times during the construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater occurred in Stromovaca, and in 2010 the soil fell into the ministry of culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of the company Metrostav of Jiří Bélokhlava, the tunnel is extremely expensive, said the week Euro.
The construction was intended to cost 17 billion dollars.
When we calculate the DPH, which has doubled during the construction period, you have a $17 billion unit.
When you read about technology, land purchases and engineering activity, valuation and similar positions, it's 29 billion, which is no longer from 37 to so far, Bälohlov said
That's what someone ordered and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to get a new iPhone operating system with new Apple update
A new operating system may be required in Settings when you click on the "General" card and select "Software Update" (update software).
When it is ready, it will offer you the opportunity to download your phone and then install it.
Some users encountered a problem after installation, in particular with the error message "slower software update".
One of the solutions to this problem is to wait until you are too interested in updating or trying via iTunes.
Your phone is running you through an update process.
This includes the need to remove applications to relax – but it will not be necessary because Apple has reduced the update and has also simplified the whole process through the use of a special tool that users propose applications to reduce and reinstall after updating.
Make sure your phone is busy before you start up-to-date.
If battery status is low, Apple will not allow the update to take place, because suspending the process could cause an update to fail.
Other messages: iOS 9 release was not delayed, despite WatchOS maintenance; iOS 9: an up-to-date update of the new operating system; iOS9: how to prepare for the release of a new operating system for iPhone
Make sure you've passed our list of things to do before update, to try and prevent or protect from them. iOS 9 will present new functions, including even smarter personal assistants and a large scale of creative functions for iPad, as well as much money to speed up and repair the operating system.
FedExu's profits mixed, tax look down for 2016
The company FedEx reported disturbing results for the last quarter and a significant decrease in the overall profit margin due to the low demand for freight and higher costs for land distribution.
The company also indicated that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers during the holiday.
In this long period of the year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers on holiday.
The shares of the company closed about 2.5 per cent in the pre-market trade 45 minutes before the middle opening.
FedEx points out that it expects a difference between $10.40 and $10.90 for a fiscal year ending next year, which means a decrease of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
The analysts expected $10.84, according to a study carried out by FactSet.
The reduced view is despite an increase in the average rate of 4.9 per cent, as shown in January 4, and higher ground transport charges for heavy or large packages which begin in November.
The company stated that it is still expected to increase profits over the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and increase in online trade.
The president of the company and the director general of the company Fred Smith said that the company "has led to a strong performance despite the expected economic conditions, particularly in the processing industry and global trade."
The holiday rental plans were announced the day after the rival company UPS announced that it has a plan to hire 90,000 to 95,000 employees, which is probably the same as last year's rent.
In the fourth year ended in July 31, FedEx won $692 million, which is about 6 per cent more than last year.
The share profit was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 for the share, which was predicted by 12 analysts questioned by Zacks Investment Research.
Markets grew by 5 per cent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts from Zacks interviewed expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been affected by a decline in priority international shipping, which has led to the rise in revenue in its Express Unit.
But boom in online shopping has enhanced the results of the federal FedEx unit.
In the last quarter, land income increased by 29 per cent, but operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for larger packages and their own insurance.
The express entity recorded higher revenue due to higher basic rates, while the profit decreased in trade due to higher labour prices.
In the pre-market trade, about an hour before the opening of FedEx's shares ended at $3.85, or 2.5 per cent, at $150.15.
They ended on Tuesday with a decrease of 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the record on 11 June.
At its most unexpected meeting throughout the year, the federal reserve legislator will spend this week two days based on 27 degrees of the long Hungarian mahogany table and will decide whether it is time to increase the key rate after almost ten years.
With regard to them at one end of the settlement of the central bank, a double-chaired meeting room will be built in the United States.
The map is a reminder that President Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are going to put the economic interests of the nation above all others.
The Central Bank has two attacks from Congress: maximising American employment and maintaining higher prices stable.
But since the Great Depression, the representatives of the Federation have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third functional period: financial stability.
This third functional period could be an X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is prepared to be released by the end of 2008 in the form of an unprecedented incentive for almost zero short-rate rates.
Although most of the data show a solid growth in the economy, recent turbulence in global financial markets could already be feared by the Fed as a result of adding to the instability by increasing its reference rate of federal funds - and nothing more than a quarter of the percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, the main economy of the steel company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they're just looking for a delay in increasing the measure, an increase in uncertainty involving the global market already gives them sufficient reason to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what Fed is doing, which is the cause of nervousness in financial markets.
Almost half of the economies recently questioned by Bloomberg predicted an increase in the rate this week.
However, financial markets expect Fed to keep its focus, with a key indicator only about 30% chance of an increase.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if Fed increases rates, only if the policy takes a loss by vowing that another increase is inconceivable.
In the afternoon, Down Jones jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, at 16,599.85.
The meeting was postponed by the expectation that Fed politicians will keep the rates of this week quiet, says John Lonski, the main economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if Fed would now raise taxes," he says.
If the Fed politicians would do this, "they should go to the country in their programme declaration and keep the financial market in its hands so that they don't fall into panic."
Other experts claimed that the increase in rates would slow the financial market down because it would remove the uncertainty about how Fed will act.
Only a month ago, it seemed that Fed was on a good way to raise the rate of 0.25 per cent this month, the first small step in the slow improvement of the exchange conditions that would confirm the economic recovery force in the United States.
Yellen said that over the course of the year and at the beginning of the year, it is expected to increase rates in this year and despite the difficulties of liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation in July was slowed down, this year's labour market marked a solid growth.
The unemployment rate is 5.1% in the previous month, which is lower in the last seven years and is close to the level which Fed considers to be full employment.
The grain profits showed signs of withdrawal.
And although inflation continues under 2% of the central bank's annual target, Fed's politicians claim that for the main reason, it has been a temporary effect on significantly lower prices of oil.
The economy "can be equal to higher rates and needs them, given the stability of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, the main economy of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets all over the world began to decline at the end of last month after China took its change.
The industrial average of Down Jones was up to 16% below its record value in May when investors feared that the Chinese economy would slow down global growth.
The market has sometimes been reflected in this month and Dow is now only about 10% of the maximum of the flowers.
The negative market situation of Fed's political actors provides a complex calculation when the rate rate increases.
"In the absence of what happened on the financial markets and reports of the Chinese economy's weakness in the last few weeks, it would come to the conclusion of this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a leading UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
He now predicts they are waiting for at least a month to get better control over the consequences.
"There are a lot of uncertainty about how this will affect the US economy, and they have almost no data to rely on as far as the latest development in China is concerned," Oliner said.
The health status of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Feds, so technical should not be included in their decisions.
But in fact, Fed became the currency authority of the whole world.
The impact of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
This former President Ben. Bernanke's note in 2013 that Fed could "use" their monetary expansion on the market, has dropped its cries all over the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly united, it can be expected that representatives of the Federation are also monitoring the development of others, but it is also consulted with other central banks and experts in order to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for wealth-management firm Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, V., noted this month that "Fed has history of movements in financial markets that seem to be independent of economic foundations."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Committee for Open Market Policy, who stressed an increase in rates, cited the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led Fed to a reduction in its reference rate of 0.75 per cent during the three meetings "I over limited identifiable effects on growth in the United States," Lacker said.
A year later, the representatives of the Fed turned these drawings.
Fed should be given priority to financial stability concerns only during the major crisis, as was the 2008 market collapse, said Adam Posen S., former member of the Committee on the Taxation in the Bank of England.
The latest strike is not even approaching this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because the markets have broken down," said Posen, President of the Institute for the International Economy of Peterson.
The Federal Reserve System Act has yet to be seconded and does not change financial stability, and unless it changes, I don't think they should get on the spot.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in the Chinese quarter.
Yes, fourth Chinese
The market was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often designated as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market which also sells for the public.
Yeah, it's a Chinese quarter, not a Thai quarter.
The market is the only contact place that offers an impressive range of pure, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian cuisine, and kitchen furniture, furniture, religious and sacred decoration.
There is even a car part available if you need some engine oil.
The deal is massive and it'll take you over an hour before you get through all the streets.
If you are hungry from all of this, go to a restaurant in LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trading venue (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has different reception places.
What's up: You need something - whatever - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
The deposits are available at price and many of the items are sold in large quantities.
The pure products include special Asian and regional Thai bees, fruit and other.
Mass expansion is great, for example, fish - employees behind your back can bite and bite, even if you expect it,
The good part of the deal is left to the massive hate section where you find frozen rice leaves, hot melons and galgabals, whole cats, fish, beef blood and honey, grapefruit juice, fish couls, regional cloves, free shops and other.
Who buys here: Owners of restaurants and chefs, as well as private families and individuals.
The broad streets go up against shopping cars and high-speed vehicles.
Nalez: The pure monthong durian near the stable.
Where is it: Trade is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, including the capital of the Chinese district and centre - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking place that shares other shops and restaurants.
While the store can be contained, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the distance stays with the old man.
The speed of 150 km/h of snow has been denied.
At selected distances, it will not be possible to increase the maximum permitted speed of up to 150 km/h under the favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, Snemovna decided to join the Senate's amendment which refused to increase the speed.
The new Land Communications Act is now intended for the President.
President Miloš Zeman has already said in depth that the law would speed up a ten-mile walk.
The increase was directed by the Minister of Transport Dan Ók (for UN), according to which the Czech Remote Network has not yet been established at such a speed.
In the morning before the delegation, the House supported the Senate's version of the law.
The approved novelty is now available in accordance with the original government proposal to increase speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class vehicles, in particular four-years.
The drawback first expanded this possibility even to the distance where it would be possible to run in the selected cuts up to 150 km/h, but the Senate rejected it.
The messengers now agreed to his proposal.
The senators agreed with the Minister for Transport of New Affairs also removed the right of the transport police to have the last word in order to correct local communications that are being sought by the citizens.
The Senate version approved by the Snémovna is also calculated to allow for channelling, water or public lighting cables to be placed below the surface of the vehicle.
The people would be saved for the land.
Citizens should also not have the obligation to take care of road plants in the area of local roads, regardless of the owner of the land concerned.
Novela will also help improve the protection of the railways and make it easier for citizens to control abandoned vehicles to which the owners are not registered.
New cities could sell abandoned vehicles which are not registered by their owners within six months of notification.
Citizens will be able to exclude transit freight transport across their territory by road to other and third classes under threat of fraud even for shipping companies.
They will also be able to introduce electronic remote markings instead of binding paper, which will be used after 1 January of the following year.
According to the government, it will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
A silent expressionist goes before the court.
He's been threatened for 10 years by the overcrowded welcome of his citizens.
The case concerns a project that has been passed on to citizens.
The police wanted to silence her in this case, and the delegation of Zuzana Kailov (ČSSD), but she was not released by the Spanish police.
According to the legal qualification of the case, both are under threat of imprisonment for up to ten years.
The main calculation is already planned for two October days.
According to the representative of the state Mandík and Macek, at least one million crowns have been damaged, resulting from complaints.
The complainant is opposed to a prominent trial.
The former members of the city's leadership, under the title of their functions, wrongly allowed the property benefits of the company which was organised by the citizens.
Mandík, according to his complaint to the former Chief of the City Services, School and Culture Master Board, has invested in the election of five companies.
When another company, which offered the lowest price, signed into the competition, the competition firm declined.
Then the city had to trust the administrators and only Darothore’s company was registered in the competition, which was then assigned to the town council.
The city paid at least one million more.
Both charges are aimed at ensuring that Darothore has given public orders to organise the action of citizens in Ústá over Labem for at least a long time and in coordination they have acted in accordance with the requirements for the treatment of the proper economy, writes the State Representative.
At the same time, they were aware that Darothore was then charged by the Office of the University of Labe with the implementation of the action against citizens of the price that would reverse the real value of the services actually provided.
For three years, the company has paid more than five million dollars for the project.
The city finally paid for only one piece, costing 1.7 million koruna and then resigned from the contract.
The amount paid was at least one million koruna.
Mandik had refused any violation of the law before.
I didn't do any criminal work, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this built-in case, the former prime minister said that the city under its leadership had only referred to a similar project over the years.
In 2008 and 2010, Roxy II provided for the event.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," Mandik added.
The criminals wanted to accuse the apostle Kail, who was also a member of the City Council.
She didn't get out of the post office, but she didn't.
Criminals have therefore dismissed the case in her case, but it is calculated that Kyle's case is after her mission has been terminated.
Greeting citizens was a social action that took place several times a year.
Her mother received a gift check for 5,000 crowns for purchases of child needs and small gifts.
The Hungarian police must have let the dog escape.
Then the reporters agreed to collect the record.
The Hungarian police at the border briefly held the cameraman of the AP agency and provided him with a record on which the police dog had probably landed to the country of refuge.
The Hungarian government, however, is questioning this charge.
A certain incident occurred on Saturday evening when cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who crossed the border with Serbia through the cornfield near the Hungarian city of Russia.
The fugitives were chased by the police, and one of them let Syria catch a dog with a cat on the couch.
The dog that cried "Please, I'm a fugitive," said Muzi.
The fact that Muzi's filming everything, he noticed one of the cops and didn't allow him to leave.
The journalist should not have called his superiors or his colleagues on the spot.
The Mozi police took him to a dark place at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he's got.
Then they ordered him to sign a note.
This was the result of the double work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt threatened because dogs were near him.
The AP Agency sent a protest letter to the Hungarian-speaking Government of Zoltán Kovács.
The conduct of the police indicated that it was unacceptable and indicated that journalists should be able to cover up events without risking physical violence and not afraid that the government would destroy legally acquired material.
Kovács, referring to the police report of Muzi's account of the incident, doubted.
He said the police were just trying to show them whether they're in some kind of business, which they're entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't use it.
"The dogs can jump - they're trained to scare and scare a little bit, but they certainly didn't," Kovács says.
Unpredictable League of Masters.
The victory of the City will catch us, believes Juventus
"It's a mess, I don't think we deserve to lose," pulled Manuel Pellegrini's head off the corner of the city.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic league game of Masters.
Not one team has created a lot of opportunities, but we had a fight on the dolls.
"The reason for the defeat was not in tactical, Juventus just shot two beautiful balls," Pellegrini assessed his escape, which was indicted by a team in a long 636-minute contest.
This finalist of the last season of Juventus on it was exactly opposite - after the first three pairs of Italian league has something that only covers the title point and the score 2:4 is located on the 16th table.
And that's why the work at Etihad Stadium was a great surprise.
"This prize will help us mentally, capture us," believed Coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three opponents - Pirla, Tévez and Vidala before the new anniversary.
In Manchester were represented by Pogba, Manzukic and Morata.
"That's right, this victory is very important, maybe thanks to him we'll go to the winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're dealing with the best men in Europe.
In the second half, we've been better, mainly in the attack phase.
This result deserves my players.
"We could have tried at 0:2 before our matching goal, but Gianluigi supported us," praised the Duke of Allegri, General Buffon.
"We've burned some good shots," hated Yayu Touré, founder of City.
We need to get out of the League of Experience Masters and next try to get a better outcome.
Good morning, Angelo. Good morning, old German II.
Before we move on to the question of immigrants, we should be aware that all this media harassment around is handled professionally.
According to the need for the media and the nurse.
And then let's stop for a second.
Today, there are newspapers and media filled with children who are not on their parents' hands after their exodus.
And that's what makes a person - so in a European person - feel guilt and guilt automatically.
Well, they don't come here just because they're confident kids, so notice at the meetings of members joining the Greek islands that there's not so much to see!
Well, we've recently lost some of the pictures of the ship's target on Lampedus, the refugees at the French border in Menton, where the beautiful transitions are made by thousands of young men.
Most of the young blacks.
And they also lost photos of Callais, where these winters and black men are waiting for them to get through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think it's gonna work.
Even the images of the primitive Christian church of Eritrea did not make any special impression on Europeans.
You're getting rid of that fucking fraud.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it's kind of assumed that it's not only about unhappy children from Syria but also about exposed - for older people: fashionfully trained - young men.
Their muscles look like they're just out of some fit center.
It's just one personal experience.
This summer we slept on the private beach of the hotel in the Turkish - Muslim - parts of Cyprus.
No matter how private she was, a large group of cars suddenly arrived at the beach.
But no snakes.
And there appeared to them young black men.
About thirty men and five women.
The age between 15 and 30 years.
They went to the beach, all clothes in their distinctive clothes and shoes. In their hands, like, smartphones.
That it's a private beach, it's not interesting and employees - Turks, Muslims - were obviously afraid of them.
They've got all the pills.
Whoever wasn't on him and was right in the sea, he was brave.
They were dressed like American rapper film.
On the head of the caps with the nose, white and colorful adidas on the legs.
Then they put on the local beach bar and started cooking.
They sat around the chairs, sat next to the morning and white guests bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children walked out of the dining terrace somewhere to rest.
The next blacks drank beer equal to a third - like in the USA series?! - on the beach, empty beds were housed around them.
They're always playing each other.
It wasn't English at all.
Then they got into a drink of wine, also from a bottle.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in the distinctive swimming pools, especially the young ladies - in the water, the mother and the children and the children fled fearfully, and in half an hour he was no longer on the beach or in the pool or in any non-black guest.
They all disappeared.
No matter whether he was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to talk about them.
The cleaning man said to me last night: "Did you see what they had on you?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it out of work," said the reader.
I said, "I know, everybody had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had about 20 inches [20 cm] of gold mass.
And women were like gold.
"Are these drug dealers?" I asked myself.
"You've really seen how they get baptized," replied the reader.
Drugs don't work, they don't use them.
They're looking for something else.
So I knew what they were doing.
It wasn't that important to me yet in June 2105.
I didn't know what was going to happen.
But the secret services and top politicians were supposed to know that first.
I don't think they'd know.
About 1.5 million immigrants were issued to Europe at the time.
And they're going, they're going, they're going.
Today it has been shown that the main problem of the European Union is that total-political-corrective policies such as intellectual and related lobbying and economic important groups have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its policy - today's publicly recognized major forces in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only are they, too, EU spies and television, including ours.
For example, recent television images of the alleged victory of refugees in Germany are at the level of Moscow TV from August 1968.
Of course, there were a few sundials on the table, but mainly - the old-fashioned - Muslims welcomed their sympathies.
For weeks they have been baffled in reports on Czech TV, as according to some research by Germany almost everyone for immigrants' income.
Anyone who's been in Germany for a few days knows it's just like a bear.
That confirms other information.
For example, a famous research on public opinion organised by the ARD - Czech Association of Public Law Television companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to receive more refugees a week ago.
That's what's been reported on on our TV.
The second day in Germany, the polls showed that 94.5 per cent of Germans no longer want any immigrants - 67,000 people attended the polls.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly announced in November 2010, five years ago: "Our efforts on multiple-culti society have been completely lost."
She went on to say, "Germany is fighting a multicultural society."
"Every effort towards such a relationship has been totally futile."
In a country where four million Muslims live, it does not believe in a strategy that has enabled people from different cultural backgrounds to live with themselves without integration.
But that's not real.
Multicultural approach when we say we're just living happily with ourselves, that's how this approach goes.
I mean, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
But Merkel may not have the power to go against strong Germany and Europe and mainly against political correctness.
It shows the scale of events.
The conflict is growing fast.
Euronémec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, a SPD messenger, the only one who is certainly not in the European Parliament - yes, that is what Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play monitors at the concentrates - has been described as already several times.
It seems, especially in the recent years of German politics, that Germany has crossed the Rubikon.
However, until the majority of European policies do not support these products, the citizens of the countries who were victims of racism are afraid.
What happened to Germany?
With those rich, successful and strong Germans?
Those who have tried for years, at least once, to deal with their terrible past of aggression and murdering millions?
Do they have the truth about what they say that in the heart of Germany, there is a devil of aggression, oppression, and violence?
Did he really have Chancellor Otto von Bismarck when he gave up all his power to the Great Britain's attempts to govern the entire centre of Europe?
When did he say the Great German idea will destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When they left her, she started preparing for World War I.
The concept of Great Britain, which led Germany and Europe to two wars that continued millions of lives, is likely to return in another way.
After the Marxists tried to rule the state, for example with the Rote Army Group, and after the failure of the NDR, a new German ideology was developed in Germany on the basis of example of ecology, which was one of the main ideas sciences of Nazism.
We'd say the sun.
The German elites have long defended the origin of German nationalism, and thus have left the peace of all those combatants against the atom, the superiors of the quest for a paradise for all, firmly supported by the old imperial and Nazi word Our forest must live.
To calm the rest of the rest of the world, young people who want to do something different and better, fully devoted themselves to the fighters against global warming, set up nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there was also a strong antisemitical - so-called pro-Palestine - and an anti-Slovenian flood that regarded all the Slovenes as a difficult verb - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after the Jewish parents, was a German nationalist.
And also as shown by the last years of Schulze and German ministers who are openly threatening disobedient eastern states, the idea of leading Germany.
Those who need to listen without refusing to listen.
You don't care!
And when we realize that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And they always stand as capital, especially German, which is the source of the fact that Germany actually controls most of the European States over the banks and the Union.
The Pseudovir sunflowers first introduced Germany into the pool of ecologicalism and multiculturalism and brought them home today and still bring perhaps millions of Muslims.
Those who, with their low voice of siren, find themselves quickly on the wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and I'm starting to blow up.
Germany can only threaten its neighbours again, it can again part of its citizens - but as it seems, the smaller part - is ideologically misleading, but ultimately reality as always realized.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim residents are already burning.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against future Islamists come to an end?
Is it possible that Muslims who have lived in Germany for a long time will come to help, but will they never be assimilation to overcome local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalization of Muslims, Islamists and Germans are left behind, following the fear of Islam in their country?
What will this do with Germany, and even with Germany, when the people who will vote and publicly protest against a new Euro-Montenegro Muslim?
Germany just changed.
The conflict in Europe called for support for solar ideologies, thus elite and essentially totalitarian ideologies, and their non-insistible banks, is growing.
And because of undeterred treatment against disobedient democratic Germans and all equal and disobedient eastern neighbours, this cannot be good.
It's over tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of incoming vendors: to scare them to death.
It's enough to lock up and the slave clasp is against you in such a way that the wrong attitudes don't have to get up.
The lively head of yours is a nice set of satchels, and it's also cooked, and it's gone (or rather served) by an unnecessary seller and a life-sustaining soybean.
Maybe it's too bad that you can't even handle your speech.
And we'd like to have a lot of fun.
Stainless steel (Oxalis corniculata).
A small powder that tolerates dry environment.
And that's how it's located between the outer courtyards near my apartment.
On 16 September 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant that belongs to expansive swimming pools, but it seems to create a beautiful idea about flowering.
It's between the outer sheets.
She's unquestionable. She's given to us in the garden.
I like the dry environment, it's easy to adapt, humble and harmless.
The wires create lists of catholic compositions, but that's why they need to watch it and take a photo.
In the details you will find the beauty of the detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with a fiolol delivery.
Brazilian Pediatric Society Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet when cooking
The Brazilian paediatric company SRS has come in a shocking way to try to give women an idea of the importance of good luck in raising images of children related to breast cancer in the form of an unhealthy diet.
Human maternal milk is made up of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide cogens with all the animals they need to create a strong immune system.
By reviewing energy requirements, it is recommended that pregnant women and newborn mothers increase daily calorie intake of 500 calories daily.
However, new studies indicate that increased calorie intake is not the only diet that mothers should take.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, professor of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that the healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic structure of their children and protected them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that ill-healthed diets had a negative impact on the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, although Nine's tries to take control of Today Show
Karla Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberry because of covering costs due to the exclusion of liberal management, they were unable to create a sufficient increase in the evaluation for Today.
The early Nine show is called from the national capital after the collapse of Malcolm Turnbulla Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Kochem and Samantha Armyage, was established in London as part of a long week of international television series, which also includes Dubai, New York, the Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It did not seem that the distance of the Aussie TV fans to this Tiranë was so far concerned because it recorded 397 000 fans in five main cities compared to 330,000 fans today.
Today reported a smaller increase in its assessment compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but their number was up to the previous quarter (343,000).
Today in the last few months is filling the gap on Sunrise.
In August, Today was averaged 318,000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the measles moved between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349 000 fans and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more this morning than just Parliament, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are all right. Thank you for asking.
Added TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news for Seven was the impressive debate 800 words with the former star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
A new drama on a recently married father who decides to move with his two children to the coastal part of New Zealand has a very large average of 1,219 million fans.
Critics wondered if Thomson himself could get a TV hit without a star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday's dinner is clear "yes".
The X Factor of Seven has left a strong 1,136 million fans, which the cold beat The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726,000)
Seven recorded mixed follow-up on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half of the new television show (from 17:00 to 17:30) that Andrew O'Keefe's introduced had 446,000 fans.
The second half (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 fans — enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half of The Chase Australia had 520,000 fans and a second half of the incredible 720,000.
Hot Seat had a average of 620,000.
Thanks to the decline of The Chase Australia from the second night, Nina will be convinced that the Hot Seat at 17:30 will finally win.
The Chase Australia is replaced by a million Dollar Minute series that failed to win McGuiro's show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is a perfect guy - but who choose?
Secrets discovered?...
Lana Jaavans-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snow Markoski may not have wanted to find out who wins Bachelor.
The woman who comes with Sam Wood to Bachelor is trapped in an inconceivable secret.
And the three girls who remain are definitely not going to lose who's the right to finally get the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snow Markoski and Lana Jaavans-Fellows the day before the last two were left, they didn't thank us for telling us who won.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut to the fourth terminal
All three lyric women discovered why Wood was a perfect man, quoted his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveity as reason why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If it wasn't the way Wood's final flower would get?" their answers could work as a competitor in relation to who gets Bachelor's heart.
Like Jeavons-Fellows, the Markos quickly named Mackay here, which would be the best way to go to Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood shared a certain day with each other.
"From the moment I entered the house and watched the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt that they were quite compatible and I still think that during the course," says Jaavans-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really thirsty woman, she's very funny with her," added Marcoski.
I saw them together and there's this right chemistry between them.
They're good together and nice.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood might be able to create a couple.
She herself claims that during his last visit home she realized that Wood could be "that right."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is no longer a game - I opened his heart to him now," he adds.
I asked who would choose Wood if she didn't. She'd be very pleased.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I have two girls as much as I like - it's between Snow and Lana.
Bachalor's out in the middle of 7.30 on Ten.
Originally published as Sarah's best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarrid Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after he moved to the United States and many teams were asked after his great start of training last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers let Hayne sit after the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which made the conversion of the Australian rubies League at the first rescue from the rise of the rise on Tuesday at 20:3 a.m. on Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and get him into the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula was also still honest in the post-game store.
Instead of getting the new ones to meet before the rest of the team, he was able to wake them up.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-mortem press conference.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, announced that Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and only tried to find another game.
During the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne made his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start where Hayne and his massive Australian fan club trusted his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught at the show when he left the field after a mistake and later told Australian radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 the worst start of the career in NFL was not even able to imagine.
"It's happening, just focus on another game and it's all," said Hayne
Hayne compared the trap to his original debate in 2007, when the deposit in its own branch territory led to three Queensland.
It was quite a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne published a photo of the fans on which she holds an Australian train on her own Instagram game.
Elton John and Rus Vladimir Putin meet for discussion on homosexual rights
In 2003, Russia's richest husband, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested by targeted gunmen at the Siberian ranch.
After openly questioned by President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his criminal company Yukos was confiscated and his democratic efforts were limited.
The U.S. has stopped the immigrants who have returned to their property rewards.
Two of them emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
Since 1989 it was no longer possible to return property, the two of them had turned to the State for damages under the Law on Extraordinary Rehabilitations.
The Court first attached the required amount, thus more than 2.8 million kroner, to the appeal court, but their fines changed by granting them only a few 90,000 kroners with reference to that compensation is fixed in accordance with the 1991 price rules.
The Emigrants stopped the Supreme Court and filed a complaint against them.
The Ministry of Finance, which was to pay for the money, was concerned about the EU.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic dimensions that the remuneration granted under the existing legislation - to present an adequate remuneration in relation to the real estate - is now only achieving a fragmented increase in the value of real estate.
"This cannot go beyond other participants so that the right-holders who have settled their rights have been restored since 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to provide compensation in the past," the judge told Jaroslav Fennyk why the EU has been on the side of immigrants.
"The Court has repeatedly expressed its concern that the general courts should act in matters of reparation so as not to impose any adverse consequences on the beneficiaries and that the objective of the reparation law is always achieved, so the opening of property damage caused by the acts of the former totalitarian state," the judge added.
Evita in the music studio DVA is now created by Radka Fischer.
In 1998 the Council of Fisher became the world’s youngest Evitua, when the wife of Argentinian dictator Ev Perón played a role in the first Czech introduction of this famous music by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in the Prague Theatre of Spiral.
He says to go back to the same role: "Evity's order has not been very similar today."
Evita is not only a wonderful role, it is also a responsibility.
As the first lady of Argentina, she recommended Monica Absolon.
I saw Monca in Evita three times, and it was definitely inspiring for me.
This is where I saw all the new ideas right now.
I'm an all-newer of modern reforms, but this is just a particular one.
"Režie Andreje Sokola is original, detached and contemporary," Fishar says.
To think about the musical performance between the two singers, come at the Narozenen concert Monika Absolon on September 27, from 19 hours in the studio Studio DVA.
They're going to raise records from Evita's music tonight.
The experience will certainly belong to the common duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Print your complaint, Argentina!).
In a limited number of presentations from the board of directors, Ondréj Sokol will also take place after the time of the film Karl Roden in the role of President Perón.
For the public interest, further terms were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech study of the world music Evita introduces the studio studio DVA in collaboration with The Real Useful Group Ltd.
London has been successful since February 2015.
In the Candrey region of Sokola, the main role of women was originally studied by Monika Absolon.
On her side, Karel Roden's cobby president Perón and Che Peter Strenačik.
Legendary song from the parts of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech texts Michael Prostějövska sounds in giving a live orchestra under the direction of Krystofa Mark, who has already participated in the first exhibition in the Spiral theatre.
4 people killed after the police shot the rubber projectiles on the demonstration in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber projectiles against the proposal of a new state constitution, the officer put them in the middle.
The violence came on Tuesday night in the fourth Rupandeh, about 175 miles west of the capital city of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a leading district officer, says that more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered in front of police stations and some housed stones and fire bombs.
Mr Dhakal points out that the police used the wet gas and then fired into the air before they stepped into the rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he says.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, known for their ability to kill, were traditionally used as less lethal alternatives, apparently caused by a high number of deaths.
This was the last week of violent demonstrations throughout Nepal's southern mountains, where members of the ethnic group of Madhes say they have established a new province under the proposed new constitution, and their political influence has been eased.
Further demonstrations in Western Nepal were also recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which requires the birth of its own state.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent attacks.
when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the province — a great step towards a new constitution but a very controversial question in Nepal, which has been centrally controlled throughout the centuries.
The work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but the lawmakers have accelerated the process after the earthquake that killed thousands of people in depth.
The legislators of this week in Kathmandu voted on the establishment of a draft constitution and the officials state that a new Charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We can't panic right now.
After the fall on the back of the master of Lithuania you didn't even have a domestic duel with hockey player Sparty (3:5).
Don't you have any fear of a similar catastrophic entry into the extralige as before?
I hope he doesn't care about anything like that.
Good morning, Folk.
NHC predicts 60% probability of cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
A large low-cost system of approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the most southern Cape Verde Islands is likely to have 60 per cent in the wake of a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, has been introduced into the southern United States National Hurrian Centre.
Another well-defined low-cool system, probably between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilamis, also has 60 percent probability of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, has added weather forecast in Miami.
Google has launched a campaign to select 11 million dollars for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) stated that it will launch a campaign aimed at selecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have sailed European states during the war from the affected and poor countries. Each selected portion of Google doubles.
Google has announced this on his blog a very unusual path.
The report on her blog was published by the employee Googlu Rita Masoudov on the basis of personal experience when, as a seven-year-old, she lost her family from Kabul.
"We have traveled in many dark streets and buses and have experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear," Masoudov said.
I was lucky.
But the growing immigrant crisis in Europe is becoming more and more familylike, willing to help.
All contributions will be shared between 4 non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Non-border doctors, International Committee for the Protection of Children, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google pointed out that all contributions made through google.com/refugeelief to a maximum of $5.5 million are doubled.
Europe faces the largest refugees from World War II, the most of which comes from the four-year-old Syrian war that has only escaped 4 million people this year.
Many people are also fleeing the war of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For peaceful obsessive diabetes, it could be useful surgery of loss
The results of the loss of surgery for peaceful obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after surgery than those with non-surgical treatment.
"The death data are long to be seen," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on loss surgery, who wrote an introduction to a new JAMA surgery study.
Dizziness surgery, bariarthritis surgery is used to reduce stomach pain by different methods.
The reduction of hunger and restrictions of the human body absorb food.
Over the years, bariarthritis operations have been shown to be effective for type 2 diabetes treatment, but most studies have been conducted in people with a morbidity index of body weight (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the weighted weight ratio of the height, is considered to be normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
The BMI values 25 or higher indicate the superiority of persons and persons with a value of more than 30 are considered to be obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from Min-Sheng General Hospital in Tchaj-wan used data collected from the 2007 study, which consists of two types of bariarthric surgery - yellow bypass and gastroectomy - in treatment procedures of type 3 diabetes patients who were mildly obese.
The average BMI among those involved in the operation ranged from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile, BMI remained among those who did not receive diabetes surgery at the same rate as 29.
In patients with surgery, diabetes was fully resolved in 36% and in part in 28 cases.
In the infected group, only 1 percent of patients and approximately 2 percent of patients were fully resolved for the comparison of diabetes.
The control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol has also been shown "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
Researchers have also monitored patients with a level of haemoglobin A1c in the blood that reflects the transient level of blood sugar in the body.
Haemoglobin A1c is best maintained under 7% of the cold, says researchers.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin of A1c is approximately 9 per cent to 6 per cent.
However, this value remained about 8 per cent in the infected group.
But this better "glycemic control" - which is reflected in better levels of A1c haemoglobin - has not reduced mortality in five years, according to major researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results with two types of operation.
After five years, the group lost more weight bypass than the gastrictomy (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), increased BMI decreases (7.4 versus 5.1) and A1c haemoglobin (3.1% versus 2.1%) and had a higher likelihood of diabetes remission (46.9% versus 16.7%).
While a new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to life-longness, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who had undergone barbaric surgery had approximately 29 per cent greater chances of survival in the next 15 years compared with a group that had tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show improvement in survival among patients after surgery, Blackstone says it is a refreshing result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"It's very critical here because it says that surgery is safer in a low-BMI group," he says without raising the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start taking their weight seriously after the fall of BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting for too long to give people the most serious thing," she says.
I think once the collection of these genetic changes, which strongly push their bodies with fat and sugar, the road back is really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalei Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to take all refugees, Dalai Lama introduced, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in domestic refugee countries.
Dalilama has raised the issue of the running emergency crisis in its exhibition when the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion was opened in Oxford, which is dedicated to the study of ethics at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He argued that, under current circumstances, the interests of mankind should be prepared before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also pointed out that the response of Western European countries, whatever it was already surprising, was inadequate in this crisis.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his own words.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Rakouska's efforts in resolving the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is beautiful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We have to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In resolving the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also expressed complaints about the 9/11 terrorist attack on George Bush and claims that "the violent reaction of the United States has caused a network of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11 I expressed my sincere concern in writing to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent road.
I know his motives were good, but he used his power and created unexpected consequences," he said to the Dalaiams.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have lived in the hospital for the past 4 years
The toxicological environment around the United States reported nearly 400 percent increase from 2010 in the number of children under 12 years of age who smoked a high alcoholic health factor according to the toxicological environment in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylorda Lopeze, director of the toxicological center of Georgia, the number of health care facilities in children up to 12 years of age who were reported on the control centre of the stomach increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are getting more frequently to these products and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who need to be taken to the facility," said Lopez CNN.
Some children drink health - care facilities deliberately, while others want to give advice to their friends or as a challenge to social media.
The video on Youtube shows nactiles how they drink sanitation because of mild habit.
Nactiles were likely to smile at the sanitation with oral water containing alcohol for stronger drinking.
Young children can be attracted to the attractive environment.
"The kids don't think it could hurt them," Lopez said.
The composition of more attractive (sanitary) means are those that are perfumed.
There are sanitary facilities with iron wires of iron, gloves or measles, which are very loving for children.
The health centre contains between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol.
Especially in young children, several places can mean alcohol consumption.
"It's a highly concentrated alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City's medical director at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
The whiskeys would not only let you breathe like this, but people leave these sanitation facilities outside and when children get to them, it's a fast way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently looked at the school and saw up to four blocks of a sanitary work with iron iron and was taken away for medical care.
Her hunger for alcohol in blood was .179, which is a double value of dust considered to be a opium in adults, according to Dr. Chris Richchey, a prenatal doctor who looked after her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah was speaking invisibly and was not able to walk after she reached the ready.
Her doctors monitored her through the night in a private hospital because of any signs of brain trauma, because the girl fell into alcohol and slipped into her head, says Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or arrange for child health care.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitation agents have been linked to death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after a combination of the health product containing toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The physicians thought that the product contained methanol, a mortal factor, more than ethanol, which was mentioned as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in North New York planned to get their "bad" teachers to place antibacterial products in the room," according to a police report.
The teacher was very allergic to sanitation and banned their presence in the rooms.
The police condemned the tired plan as "immortal pressure," and referred to the school's fourth grade discipline,
Fáma: There is no disagreement in the Celtic team
Griffiths is bathelysing about non-conformity in Celtic, while Deila admits that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he'll return it.
Hearts will fight SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is worried that the new forces from the ice will break a team.
Dons increase their impact on Celtics by 5 points
The Pentalate of the first half of ADAMA Rooney gave Aberdeen a strong victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, thanks to which Dons won a five-way battle between himself and Celtic.
Griffiths Papers on Disagreement
This situation caused conflict in Celtic, which was challenged by Griffiths, who insists that he and his associates do not work under any pressure from increased supervision in preparations for a match with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're feeling under pressure, I think it's fun to play it.
Lack of Scottish title rival offers the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Founder Rangers and former representative of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer claim that the Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic - because there are no rivals among them because of the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ambassador Ajaxu, says: "In the Netherlands they no longer show it best in Celtic's game, and why?"
Because there's no Rangers there anymore.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers return.
He's talking about an old firm.
They're talking about both groups, and they're just interested in it.
The old company's game has a great deal of pressure and not only people from Scotland are watching these games.
I'm turning things back to good, Deila is committed.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was a little busy, but the Norwegian chief made a commitment to turn things around to good.
The Malem strike and the following fall from the League of Masters was soon followed by the defeat of Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now relates to the top of the five-footed table.
But Deila says, "Celtic's been through a bad time and will wake up again."
Now we want to get out of it as soon as possible.
I know that it's very frustrating and many people are really, really angry or sad by the current action.
We're on it all the same - but we have to go on.
Really, we really need Celtic's support, because thanks to her players, they're much better.
Now it's very important to stay with you.
Warburton's worried about the cold power
Despite the comments made a few weeks ago and indicating that he had already identified some of his nuclear targets, Chief Rangers Mark Warburton is concerned about the big purchase of power and insists that he doesn't want to break a team from Ibrox.
The former Chief of Brentford says, "The ice-cream window is very different from that of the year."
Players who arrive in summer have a whole pre-session period to stay, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes more damage comes from adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
The criminal objective of Celticus Michu indicates income to income
Lieutenant Swansea Michu, who was associated with Celtic in the sinful window, pointed out that after his contract had been concluded, Swansea could go to bed.
Two years ago, a 20-year-old shooter had a problem with an emergency kitten and couldn't find a way out of Wales this year.
Hearts will fight SFA for comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1, when Paterson was sent to the castle and finally lost 3-2, but the red card on this defense was later deleted - one about the third red card issued by decision Collum who was called.
Neilson stands for his claim and says, "I have no doubt integrity, I have not commented on the performance."
Griffiths committed to avoiding Tynecastle
The hardheaded Hibbe was severely punished after he admitted that he sang a song with a text intended for the former player Hearts Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in an environment in the Roserburn area in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Wall in Tynecastle in March 2014
"It's been a waste and it's a terrible moment," the attacker said and continues, "I can't say I'm safe to go back to Tynecastle unless it's in Celtic style."
The Council in Tannadic believes in Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United Council still believes in changing the situation by current team management - but he will assume that the crash on the game must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We're preparing the boy for action again," Donnelly promises.
McCinnes is happy for "a great victory" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to look forward to holding against Hamilton Aces in order to be able to win the seven and five-way battle against Celtics on the top of the table thanks to the first half of Adam Rooney's hand.
McInnes says, "There's no team that won anything, no more food or leagues, no more than he won this kind of game."
Scotland's unemployment remains unchanged while total unemployment is rising
INSTRUCTIONS in Scotland remain unchanged at the rate of 164,000 during the period between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose from 10 000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent higher than in the UK (5.5 per cent), as data from the National Statistics Office (ONS) showed.
During the period of three months between employment in Scotland, the number of workers now stopped at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland is 74.0 per cent during the fourth year - which is 73.5 per cent above the British average.
The State Secretary of Scotland, David Mundell, commented on the latest data: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly the year that Scotland made its historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have witnessed further improvements in the labour market and the cost of growth, while unemployment has stopped.
Why I Was a Witness to Correction in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I will follow the murder of a man.
If this happens, and I hope it won't happen, I'll sit in a visiting gallery in the death chamber of the Oklahoma State Prison and I'll see Richard Glossip, who will be corrected by the death injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officers who would testify to his death.
I first received a call in January through my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day draws near, I'm beginning to be afraid.
So why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer me this unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to follow the corrections in America and because they are often more demanding than free places, a Morbid lottery is held that determines who will be elected.
The audience reduced the number of seats for the reporters from 12 to five.
Whoever will be chosen will be followed by a complete improvement.
I can't do that.
I'll sit next to my closest friend Richard Glossip, and I've created a special opportunity for him through the months of phone calls and two and a half hours of visits.
I like that guy.
We often laugh when we talk to each other.
The federal government says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't have a note block and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my neutrality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the behavior as he's gonna get it done, get access.
I was worried about her.
She admitted that "it could have been better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossy had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could ever remove me from the witness list.
But he wants an international journalist who'll be ready to tell the story.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help in dealing with the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, journalist from Huffington Post, will be on my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've created.
I'm not going to give up all the details here again.
I can't be sure Richard Glossy's innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would make him guilty of a criminal offence.
But I believe there's a high probability that he's innocent of murder.
I firmly believe that sufficient evidence has not been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, correction is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll follow his death.
I can't say I'm really objective.
To that end, you can turn to other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I like to die of the rest of my life.
A man unique from Canning River after the police hog
The Canning Valley guard remained dry after he freed the man from the Canning River.
The fate of a man from Peter that he escaped from the police didn't go out after he got into the soft water pool only a few yards from a cop who tried to force him back on his knees.
The police from Canning Valley were invited to an incident that took place in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When he saw a suspect, he tried to rescue them by the Canning River.
But he's gone a long way.
"He stood in the water and repeated 'I'm not going out, just come for me'," said Sergeant Schhandl Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perahac just didn't want to break the uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactic and that's a police union."
"People sometimes try to do when they run away from toys," Castledine said.
The Ben Cousins football champion provides a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins set up a car to avoid a bus and tried to cross the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning the betalon Ben Cousse.
Peter Moody claims that his computers tried to spy on him and threatened to finish the race
Peeter Moody accused his PC Racing Victoria of trying to get him a spy and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He focused on computers and integrity department Racing Victoria and was convinced that they had a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late kidnapping on the day of the race, which was his last shot.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for the race and read in a difficult situation about Lidarin's positive cover on a cobalt that he couldn't explain.
He went into the language with regard to the Spanish charge for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dangerous."
"I didn't mean to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it's all going out of you right away," Moody said.
He knows it went on.
Sometimes you respond and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to go with my head up and let the owners think I'm doing the best I can for them.
When I start thinking again, I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I should consider what I'm going to do with my license.
In the past Moody released in his conversation for racing.com a bomb that the department's integrity tried to spy on him.
"Before the 18th month Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will call after question - and offered him employment in my standings to find out about the things that are being done in my condition," Moody said at Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a submarine.
If that's true, everyone should show their information because they're trying to catch me completely burned.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current director general of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it's becoming a personal matter?
Does the RVL grow a couple of chickens and order people to take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I wrong about this industry?
Am I really so bad for this industry?
Maybe more people think yes.
Maybe I need my license and I need to get out of here and I have no doubt that what I'm telling them right now will give them an idea.
But I got to the point when I don't care about it anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really bothered me.
I'll press them and hand them over to make their decision.
I have support for my family and I can go away.
The trainer's cold frustration increased by a long-term study of cobalt, including Lidari, and recent theft in it caused a feeling that "he could have his license on board."
Mood, the most famous for the preparation of the unaccompanied Black Caviar champion, has marked the seasoning rule on the day of the race for "murmory" after the horse was applied on his feet by a wooden board or blue, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my team was wrong to put his leg on his feet.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday and it happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody has been subjected to three months' disqualification for the treatment of crews on the day of the race for which the authorities have already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram driver who was arrested
The police arrested the man who hit the bike and went after the train on the weekend in Cobra.
The cyclist was transported by plane to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after a car was hit on the main Murray Valley train on Saturday morning.
The police reported that the driver left without stopping and helping the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia introduced himself to the police at Shepparton.
It is expected that it will be accused of not stopping in the event of an accident, not providing assistance and other transport offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, stays in a stable hospital.
Trainer Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy brings back injuries to rivals due to resurrection claims
Craig Bellamy, coach Melbourne Storm, criticised the steps of his players as "setting up a plan" by two NRL primers.
Trent Robinson, coach Sydney Roosters, said that decision-makers allowed Storm players to "wrestle" his player during the controversial win of the Storm team in the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach Brisbane Broncos, made it easy to take note of Strom after his team won the final qualification over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening when he called the game "visit" the gang of the league and said that two of Queensland were not "too big" on the resurrectionling.
Bellamy defended the steps of his players and said that during them they focused on contact.
Bellamy added that this situation increased his consciousness because his team was criticized by two leading trainers, which could mean they're scared of defeating Storm team.
"It's still coming--I don't remember Trent Robinson would talk about the resurrection when we were defeated 24-2," said in the middle of Bellamy.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything from our defense system and technology in the last year, we've only been focusing on contact during the last few weeks, which meant business for us.
Trent has been here for three years and clearly training a great team, so it's probably not common to lose what might have been a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how things like this will always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy rejected Bennett's idea of "increasing football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's St George-Illawarr Dragons won in 2010 by the primership playing "no" football.
Wayne's talking about an exciting football.
He had the truth that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours. It was also exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was criticized for being a nude team and Wayne said it was totally his fault.
But now he's got a team that can play the style of games that belongs to him, especially his young sponsors with their speed.
Such a football you would like to play if you had this type of player available.
He said this in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his football style - but not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It makes me more aware because they say such things because they're worried about the game against us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't even think about us when they got to big games.
Bellamy also showed the fact that the Storm and Roosters game dropped more flags than the Broncos and Cowboys game.
The Broncos team game was probably good, I didn't see it, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two other attempts, but is it an exciting football?
Or is it interesting to stop and stop trying?
I think they're agents.
If they mention us, it means we'll meet again in a certain phase.
Storm has this weekend's stop and won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Chronulla Sharks at the front end of the next Saturday evening in AAMI Park.
The Serbian man got a bribe of US$200,000 for drug charges
A man who led a possible life with 40 kilograms of cocaine seized from Queensland received $200,000.
Marco Maximovic (29 years old) was one of the five men who was arrested by the federal police after 100 kilograms of the Solay yacht, which came from South America through Vanuatu and occupied Coomer in July.
Maximovic was interviewed at a meeting with a fellow accused in the port during the morning and later met with them at the Coomere Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Although he was leading a potential trial of life for the possession of cocaine commercial quality, lawyer Maximovice challenged that there was no evidence that he would own the entire quantity and that he could be in the coffee shop completely and innocently.
Judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flalangan, thought Maximovic would have jumped.
He's got a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the middle of the court.
At the funeral, he lied to the police about where he lived.
His mother and father Maximovice offered him 200 000 dollars for his release together.
"After reading the solemn statements of both persons it is clear that the deposit of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
Their efforts alone were apparently inadequate, since the accused had not been brought before the court, he warned.
Maximovic was given a bail under the condition that both Australian and Serbian passports are issued, will be reported to the police every day and will be ordered to leave from 18 hours to 6 in the morning.
Steven Hogg used the phone to find pedophiles to send images
Pedofil used a cell phone for eleven girls to get pictures of child abuse.
Steven Hogg took a call from girls when she was asleep and then joined her on her online chat, where he had a lot of unheard-of pictures of children that another user sent to him.
The girl then looked around and found out she missed her phone and then found it in the hand of Hogga.
She passed it, and before she warned her mother, she found disturbing news.
The police started and saw five photographs, followed by analytic computers found an address and found a "disquieting" search on the web using expressions to search for incorrect images of children.
Hogg then told the police that his reason was "to bring pedophiles" on the Internet before "to pretend he's a police officer and scare him."
"He said that it was a responsibility - that it was up to people to fear.
He admitted that he was doing a computer search, but he claims he was just trying to pretend he's a cop to scare the pedophile.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send another one.
According to him, he did it to find them.
He claims it went through his opium and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother, screamed and cried.
She saw the wrong picture on her phone and complained after she was confronted.
The girl was listening and talking about how sorry she was using her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he was.
Hog, 23, a residence in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted guilty of filing a complaint concerning the adoption or supply of inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, violated the conditions of the case on 25 January and was not brought before the Court of 24 March of that year.
The lawyer would call Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the list of sexual delinquents, because he could argue that there was "no basic sexual subtext in his action."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has issued a ruling for the announcement of social workers.
In this case, Hogg was taken into custody, but he was held in custody before hearing about other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sexual delinquents before the date of his trial.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe has made a mistake in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the stairs leading to the floor earlier this year.
He wasn't injured, but his video of his fall became official in social media.
Parliament's opening was also distorted by the claims of opposition legislators that they had received anonymous threats against the murder they had warned of before Mr. Mugabe's execution during his demonstration.
Last month, they wrote it and invoked it during its exhibition on the status of the people in Parliament - which is the word he had repatriated in the afternoon.
The President of the Hnuttian Party for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition policies had adopted text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to prevent Mr. Mugabe's appearance.
"The message comes from numbers that don't appear, but it's called 'death'," he told reporters after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It shall warn the members concerned to know that immunity ends in Parliament and when they are expelled from Parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The Chief said that the party led by Morgan Tswangari has "bows" in respect of the opposition against the Members.
Hewlett-Packard is trying to reduce the number of jobs to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard cancels out 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its efforts to restructure and reduce the costs of business services.
The HP company will be divided into two companies listed on the bridge later this year and distributes business with computers and printers from its faster growing company hardware and services operations.
The expected decline in the number of jobs will result in a change of approximately $2.7 billion and will start in the fourth quarter, says the HP statement.
"This restructuring activity will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable expenditure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, Head of the HP company and the president of the event that will take place in the face of the unit after division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more sophisticated than today's HP and will have a wide-ranging portfolio of businesses that will help businesses switch to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the needs of our customers around the world.
The Hewlett Parkard Enterprise will have more than $50 billion after its annual receipt and "will be focused on providing non-competitive integrated technology solutions" by companies.
This leads to the dispersion of the company founded by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, producing electrical equipment and their garage in Palo Alto was transformed into "the family of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone massive reorganisation to control movement from traditional personal computers on mobile devices.
This HP company, the second largest PC producer and one of the largest technical companies in America, is the latest from this sector based on the belief that the company's involvement has better results.
Captain Arsenálu Mikel Arteta says the co-players have to get injured Jack Willsher before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also pointed out for Willsher that he's still only sitting and, if his rehabilitation goes according to the plan, there's no reason he won't play again about the holidays.
This best scenario already means that Willsher will certainly mix at least four other English games and, from the standpoint of history, his involvement in the next annual European art is obviously uncertain.
The great harm of this most recent problem is that Willsher ended the last season of power after he was hit by a knife and then he got back into the previous form during the presidential session.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger says.
It's the morning she's calling for treatment.
There's nothing special about it.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't his knights or any injuries he had suffered before.
This could be from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger acknowledged that there is a relative danger of other injuries when any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern here.
The investigation carried out by Primer Injuries Ltd. records 23 different injuries to Willsher since he had his hero debut six years ago.
For the last five years, he has only played in the 65 leagues of Arsenál from total 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal this means that in the sixth eight season from 2007-08 he was one of two Premier League clubs who lost most of the days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the preserved circle, but Arsenal believes that the improvement in the areas of marked injury during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you return after injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and get a competition," says Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he'll have a career that he deserves.
Arsenal starts a campaign in Lize campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to attack his team.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arta are likely to occur.
Wenger could also start with Kiera Gibbs and Oliver Giroud instead of Nacho Montreal Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and let players who need it breathe," Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear preference for the F-group procedure, Maximir in Zagreb has the history of the most scary stadium in Europe.
The dynamics were also not defeated in all 41 matches after last season they held the campaign "undefeated".
On Wednesday night, the stadium was hit by 3.2 degrees Richter.
It was this year in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenál has learned from the past season of the League of Champions when he's chapterled against Monaco and remains his distant hope of bringing the club to the first victory in the European Union.
"This find is huge," says Wenger.
Arsenal never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand I must be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not artists.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar views in various shows is striking, especially in view of the need for men to open up more confidently than ever in relation to suicide among young men up to 15 years of age.
In 2013, there was one largest cause of death in men between the ages of 20 and 45 years in Britain and three times more in men than in women.
In an attempt to solve this problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserrably (CALM) marked 2015 as the Year of Men whose aim is to question a culture that prevents men from seeking help if necessary.
There is friendship in the heart of this struggle to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 secondary school students showing signs of depression found that if the injured person had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy disability", their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the bread of healthy friends offers half a chance to deal with mental problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must be first reached.
In this communication through social media focusing on style rather than content of communication, immediate response is often given priority before meaningful contact.
With our digital lives, our need has doubled to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful, even though we are actually more insulating.
This surface success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, images, social status, all for the sake of our real values - our personal touch after growth and friendship - which have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire recently explained to her, the money really doesn't buy more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was the source of this idea for him.
No one in the office has defined their work, but their personalities, which have been created through friendly interaction.
Joey Humor and Chandler's frequent victims, moments of watching the football on the comfortable crystals, Ross's touch after Rachel, all the changes from knowing that yes, men can also grieve, even though most of them leave their feelings for themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me: "My role as a listening person who feels depressed or has suicidal thoughts has really proved to me that even those least friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel unable to communicate with their friends.
The old saying "to deal with" is strong in the sense that it will be considered weak to open up problems.
Friends are one of the orders that will appear in my mind when I try to offer a longer-term equation.
It highlights a small moment in a man's friendship.
As far as I'm concerned, the position of the outsider on the phone helps people in times of confidence, but long-term support must come from more close friends and family networks.
So if you click this weekend on the FriendsFest ordered station Comedy Central, why not take your friends to Central Perka, where the interior will be completely processed for the occasion of the celebration.
Or when you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and greet him.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
A series of Friends will be sent to Comedy Central station from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria has been able to care for and help PSG in Malmo abroad
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuid and Edinson Cavanim after the launch of a branch against Malma.
Angel Di Maria took care of his debate in Lize Misters and helped PSG in the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the story of the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were both skinned in the morning game and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in Lize Misters with a final comfort victory 2-0 against Malma at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot the bank less than four minutes after his debate in Lize Misters, and this PSG player sent French champions for victory, but then they won several chances until they finally found their chance when Cavani shot the bank head in 61 minutes.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the Paris team needed a strong start against Swedish champions, because they are not only focused on qualifying for the racing bikes, but on improving their journey to the fourth final that were recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they got three points, it wasn't the classic performance of Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was Marnotratic before the branch and later challenged his local team and club where he started his prestigious career in 1999.
"In Lize Misters it is not easy to win out or home, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents problems and looking comfortable in the defence is a good start, even though there are things we will have to improve with the season's process," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I'm sorry we didn't shoot at one or two branches more.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury as one of the three changes to the PSG team that held home this weekend 2-2 with Bordeaux in Lize 1, but was arrested in the fourth minute by Di Mariou.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who picked up PSG in Europe at a new level after crossing from Manchester United last month and showed why when he ran to the pass of Marc Verratti for Malma's defense and with a beautiful finish sent the fight behind Johan Willanda to a distant red bank.
However, if anyone expected it to launch a great PSG victory, he had to be broken.
Malmo, who won Celtic in play-off and got into this phase, had 9 international players in the basic system and five defenses and two undercover hostages were a difficult opponent.
But in addition to the shots by Nikola Djurdjic, who just passed the remote army of Kevin Trappa branch at 34 minutes, they didn't offer it in a lot of attack.
Instead, the PSG itself was concerned about the benefits of the attack by the bad gambling and malicious ending which was not good either from Ibrahimomite, who could not even shoot five times in the first half, and then broke up because his shot came into the network shortly after the start of the second half of Cavani.
However, he proved much more appropriate when he came to prepare a chance for his partner and was right from his play when Di Maria sent a sharp shot that ended in the Wildan branch in 52 minutes.
The second ball finally came after an hour of game thanks to Cavanim, this Uruguayan headman was sent to the square by the sixth ball of this season after Ibrahimovic picked him up after the player from the left wing of Maxwell.
This ended all Malma's thoughts about the possibility that they could draw something out of the game, and only the outstanding weekend of Willanda from the great neighborhood was measured by the hope of David Luise, and the score remained unchanged even when Ezekiel Lavezzi's throat was unknown at the end of the game.
The coach of the Malmo Age Hareide team later admitted that PSG was on top of his team, Nor said: "Our last game in Lize Masters took place in December last year."
Since then we've only played Swedish league that's not at the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Clog down for Paris.
It was a catchy trap for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion for sale of shares
The professional giant Glencore has settled in Switzerland, which has been charged with the price of comedy, made an average of $2.5 billion from the sale of shares within its extended debt reduction plan.
Glencore points out in its statement that she sold a new share of about £1.6 billion to pay the debt.
This company, which has lost 57% of its market value this year, is affected by falling the price of comedy, as the Chinese slowdown reduces demand and distorts the sharp effects on the market.
The problem of law has sent Glencore's share price to the top of the London stock market in the time-consuming early trade.
The shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pounds to the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 per cent above.
Glencore's company has withdrawn last week that the sale of a share of $2.5 billion is part of a broader plan to reduce their debt of $30 billion, which was collected about a third.
The company sold a new share at the price of 123 per cent of the share, which meant a 2,4 per cent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
So 1.3 billion shares were removed at a total price of 9.99 per cent per group.
As regards the prolongation of Chinese growth, the price of iron and coal, honey and other comedities dropped by 20 to 40 per cent.
The White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the United States at the end of the month, confirming the White House in his yesterday report.
The first visit of President Xi in Washington on 25 September in the response of Barack Obamy to the visit to Beijing, where the president welcomed him in November, gave a report.
The American President and First Lady Michelle Obama called on President Xi and his though Peng Liyuan at the state dinner that will take place after the end of the talks.
"The visit of President Xi provides an opportunity for reconciliation of relations between the United States and China and offers cooperation in solving problems in the field of international, regional and common interests and is an opportunity for constructive debate on the differences between the two states," the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in the vicinity, should visit Seattle, where he meets a number of US technical leaders on the way to Washington and then continues to New York at the UN summit.
It is expected that Obama and Xi will solve the controversial problems, including the fear of Washington from the data cyberspace of China and its growing aggression in the waters of the South Pacific Sea.
As a refugee crisis spread the Schengen area.
The nuisance lights fired by Germany did not reach the European team far, but it is already pushing the ship to change course, wrote French daily Le Figaro.
The European Union decided to deal on Monday with the refugee problem: it will be more systematic to classify migrants and asylum seekers as they move on an old continent - particularly in Greece - than to think about the future distribution of refugees by quotas on the basis of the quantity which is growing in reality.
Six days after the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 EU 28 countries to relocate 160 000 refugees, ministers in the Member States changed their priorities.
Before dealing with the final destination of refugees, it is first necessary to filter those who are already coming and to resolve the fates of those who are already moving inside the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is necessary for managing migration," highlighted in the text of the Ministerial Conference on Monday in Brussels.
After the crisis, the EU finds out that it is at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its determination and increases pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Rakouska, but without blocking the presence of those seeking asylum in this country.
The central power thus makes it clear that without it there is no free movement in Europe.
As evidence, Rakousko and Slovenia joined this measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France also consider this to be true, although with different intensity.
Hungary has been responsible for this for a long time.
These exceptional and temporary measures are acceptable in accordance with the Schengen rules.
It's about the dominant effect, but it's also blind.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already entered the country.
The French Minister inside Bernard Cazenev and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière were actively discussing this during a private discussion with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea isn't anything new, but it's real.
In Italy two-thirds of the new incoming runners were already registered and identified by informal statistics.
Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point on its territory because they fear more than others that no camps will be left on its streets where refugees will gather on its account.
The actual black hole remains in Greece.
On its islands near the Turkish border, more than 200 thousand people attended this year, twice as many as they had recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after the overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge weird opening.
The Athenians who are still in the financial gap and who are waiting for a new government have put their hands into the crown.
This is the east point for the Balkan road and the source of the current common care for the German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission makes a promise that the control points will be introduced as soon as possible, but no number or date has been introduced.
"The challenges facing Greece relate to Europe as a whole," the EU minister agreed on Monday on the mobilisation of this front.
It is therefore necessary to establish in this country a task force of the European Frontex Border Control Agency.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for asylum seekers and strengthen surveillance over the islands.
"The need for appropriate financial resources," warns the text submitted to the ministers for approval.
From the point of view of law they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The issue of the origin of real European border guards was not officially raised, but Europe is closer.
The new emergency situation of the eight-year-old so called for a second issue of binding quotas and 160 thousand refugees, which had already been raised by the Commission of Juncker and the European Parliament and which strongly supported Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Poland still don't want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their integrity.
The number, but the duty, was kept on Monday in the text approved by the majority of the eight-year-olds.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process has been interrupted.
The only firm promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees in the next two years, which has already been reached during the EU's June Hectic Summit, is Le Figaro.
Seven dead under the mountain in the Alps, probably three of them.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who killed the mountain in the French Alps.
According to the German Nationality, a woman also survived as one of the eight-year-old groups.
Previously on the media, we said it was about Polka.
About 30 years ago, a woman with a serious foot injury in the bone marrow was hospitalized in the city of Briancon.
The dead were created according to AFP mainly four-year-olds.
"The rescue action has ended, the victim's body has also been transferred to Briancon," stated the Prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department Pierre Besnard.
The accident occurred about Monday morning in the Pelvoux mountain area under the top of the mountain Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 metres.
"The narrow mountain was 250 metres wide and about a meter high," noted the chief of rescuers Nicolas Colombani.
In the eighth group, it said that there was a huge amount of snow at a height of about 1,300 feet [9,300 m].
Meteorological services today were not protected in the area prior to the emergency.
Before writing to Brago: Finally, Europe is right.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovsky, at his prizes in the prizes, was able to pass through the European League to the core group and now he is glad to enjoy this right to Europe with the team.
Sloven on the introduction of the main stage of the competition welcomes the finalist since 2011 Bragu and according to her taste she wants to include her her artistic style.
After all the nerves in the planning wars, when every cave and every situation could get you on your way to the right group, now we're there and we're gonna play six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to be afraid of every hacked bank, we can play our tactics, and we're not bound by only two arms.
"I am very happy about this and it's true Europe, before it was just qualifications," said the Tripisšovski at a press conference.
Bragu thinks it's a top team.
It will be very active, having the same Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the games.
The opponent may be even harder because he doesn't have such a name, but at the same time, he has a player in his frame, who showered Manchester with three balls.
"It's a great whole at the top level of teams," Trpišovski noted.
But Bragu doesn't consider it to be a good favor.
I take it so we play home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we have also shown in domestic competition even in the past that we are strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm it," said the team who lost out of the eleven duels of this season just the initial Superpohar in Plyznia.
He believes Liberec can also include Braze in his style.
We're waiting for a team that's going to be strong on the sword, but it's not typical for them to be disciplined.
They play from 4-4-2 dispersion with rapid transition to the attack phase.
"It's a very difficult opponent, we've discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players will do it at the game," said Tripisšovski.
In the past, we have studied a lot of competition that has been very helpful to us, this time we want to focus on our game, which we have also adapted our training.
"And we certainly want, even though it's very hard to play according to our notts," added the poet.
The student films are a government song, an international festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries reported their work on the 15th anniversary of the International Film Festival in Pisa.
Four dozen of them, which are composed of students and pedagogists, will be released from Portic on 15 to 18 October.
The best of them to choose an international court, said the speech festival of Jacob Charvát.
Every year, she has her special theme, which is different from the festival ring.
This year it's a detective.
The director of the annual festival evenings Richard Blumenfeld plans to combine the features of television, film and theatre.
"And of course we must also solve the crime that has been released in our annual guide," Charvát said.
Visitors will see the choice of the most interesting of student creations - movies fed, animated and documentary.
It will be evaluated by the International Court of Justice, which will include, for example, the winner of the previous anniversary, Director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
The organizers of the festival prepare an authentic programme every year.
Comes Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondréj Ruml, professional player at Didgeridoo Ondréj Smyekal, turboshanson group Politíme?, play hat Zrní or, for example, Petra Hapkov with a recital Living on the bar.
The festival will host two photo exhibitions.
The first introduction of the graduation of the Music Film School and holder of prestigious evaluations, including the World Press Photo 2014, Jan Ashenbrenner.
The second exhibition is close to the atmosphere that ran into Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
In a speech with visitors, cameraman and documentaryist Martin Čech, German film The Cameraman is playing his music by Gerhard Gruber and song family Brukner, Newborn and Hlach at Jan Novotný's workshop, will be baptized in his new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Onríčka, the FAMO boss in Píska, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy that will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop social relations and the film series," said the speaker.
This will certainly help the Pitching Forum, where students can meet with film professionals, complete several job competitions immediately and get such a job position.
The festival is linked to the creation of Soukrome higher professional film schools in Pisk.
Her founder, Vladana's husband and Millon Tercov, organized the first anniversary in 1997.
By the sixth year, he was born once in two years.
In the event of a CK fall, they have insurance loans to customers in full.
Insurers should collect customer benefits in case of a failure of the travel office in full.
She decided to do so in the middle of the contract by adopting an amended new law on conditions of business in the road.
Travel officials will be able, according to the proposal aimed at assessing the situation in the Senate, to compensate for the loss of the bank guarantee.
The insurance undertaking shall not agree with the obligation to raise customer loans even beyond the established limit.
The local development ministry insists on improving, argues against consumer protection.
Insurance has already threatened that it will end the insurance of travel offices against the rent when it is reimbursed.
The proposal is also criticised by travel officials.
Without insurance they're gonna have to either end or go to a foreign country.
The Ministry for Local Development, Karl Schlecht (for UN), pointed out that cases where insurance did not pay full compensation are not euro-compliant.
She noted the annual decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client has the right to full return of money regardless of the limit of the insurance.
The insurance will provide sufficient information on the management of travel offices and will be able to determine the correct limit, highlighted by Šlechto.
"We appreciate the efforts to increase consumer protection, but there must be such a limit in order to be feasible," said President TOP 09 Miroslav Diosek.
He says the bank guarantee won't work because no one will give it unlimited.
"The road offices will have to end their activity or move to a foreign country," warned Godsek.
The President of the Association of Czech Travel Offices and the Agency of Tomio Okamura (SPD) did not agree on the basis of an investigation between the CK Member States.
"Stop giving us lobbying insurance," he said.
The statement of assurance does not confer upon Okamura any relevant, no official written statement in this sense.
They find out, however, whether the travel agencies will make a co-operation which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
Prior to its establishment, Jana Fischer (ODS), who referred to the position of the ČR Travel Offices Association, and her website colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about reducing obstacles to the Czech Travel Office.
Traveling offices according to Fischer won't be able to sit down.
"Consumer protection works," Judge Fischer.
Her proposal to release a controversial passport had not been approved.
He did not even go out of Vojtéch Filip (KSCHM) with a proposal to return the proposal to the committee because of a particular dispute with the civil law.
Philip warned travel agencies that consumers might be at risk.
The rapporteur of the proposal, Martin Berdych (ANO), in view of the Court's judgment, made its proposal to limit liability in cases where they could not know that the insurance is not covered by the whole risk.
There will no longer be an original minimum four million insurance limit for travel officers offering air transport tickets and a million limit for office selling buses, for example.
The limit shall remain at 30 per cent of the planned sales of the goods.
However, there will be a need to cover all customer charges in the event of the accident of the travel officer.
The standard also provides that travel agencies will have to re-enter the sales of the goods organised by the travel agency.
Travel officials will have to provide insurance before the contract is concluded, except for other information on the management and number of passengers.
The approved amending proposal of the Committee for Public Administration shall also be calculated with other regular information.
Travel officials will have to provide them with information on the number of passengers and sales, the total price of the sales of the goods and the level of the warehouse and the market for the journeys and the instructions for them.
If the local development ministry finds that the travel office has failed to fulfil any of its legal obligations against insurance, call it on the proposal to amend it or it will be able to prohibit it from concluding a new contract if the breach of the obligation could threaten the interests of customers.
Newela also has to adjust the financing of mountain services.
The Ministry for Local Development will determine the amount of mountain service grant on the basis of its request, which will always be given by the end of the year.
The application will include a report on the use of state money in the past year, a financial plan for expenditure and an overview for the next two years.
According to the association, the legislator did not consider what would happen if the insurance said the CK contract.
This will not be allowed to arrange the rides and customers who bought the ticket before the insurance is refused will come to it according to the association.
In such a case, the CK will suffer significant loss and may fail, although its management was in good condition.
One of the ways in which travel officials can deal with such a situation will be the application for compensation.
Another option will be to move from one country to another and use many soft conditions in another country, and then on our market we will only act as agencies, said the vice president of Jan Papez.
The proposal was new according to it also contains bank guarantee institutions, but it was not so much imagined that it could not be implemented in practice as bank guarantee could not be made to an unlimited amount.
In addition, according to the association, the change in the traditional practice of de facto is essential.
In the two-year horizon, it will be necessary to recast the whole law in the new EU Directive.
The Czech market is currently operating at least 942 active travel offices.
In this year, only three CKs have completed their activities.
Turkish travel offices sell annual revenue at the cost of 20 billion Kč.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must be established to improve humanitarian conditions in emergency camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to prevent the arrival of refugees to Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after meeting with the German prime minister.
At the same time, she called again for the distribution of refugees who had already arrived in the EU between the Member States of eight.
We need to help the country where refugees leave, if any, where they stay after their departure.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will establish adequate conditions in the refugee camps, such as Jordan and Lebanon, the German Chancellor said that such a signal could also provide higher financial assistance or further EU cooperation with international humanitarian organisations.
"The social countries also support the German government in order to ensure a fair settlement of the burden of the emergency crisis on the European country," Merkel added.
In this connection to the press conference, Land Prime Minister Braniborg Dietmar Woodke said he expects real solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of EU runners on the basis of a long-term quota is also rejected by other Czechs.
Merkel and Woodke were also mentioned to speed up the asylum process in Germany.
People must first know if they have the chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start with the integration of foreigners more quickly, said the Branibor Prime Minister.
According to him, the majority of the money that Germany spends on the care of the elderly must also be used to integrate those who have the chance of getting asylum.
More teachers will be needed to control German refugees.
It's a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if it is possible for ordinary people to integrate, they can be a contribution for us, he said.
Matt Damon recapitalises diversity and film
Matt Damon faced an afro-aesthetic filmer Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity with the claim that it was not necessary for scenes.
During the weekly HBO episodes of Greenlight project, he interrupted here in the Brown series, stressing the need for alternative views regarding black protagonists in the scenario.
"When we talk about diversity, you're doing it by contenting the film and not by contenting the show," says Damon.
shocked, she reacted badly to Brown with mistrust and exclaimed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments about Martjana were received into the mail.
Damon and Brown joined a well-known producer, Ben Affleck and Brothers Farrelly, to discuss finalist shows.
"I'd like to call people to think about how anyone's director is going to behave to the character of Harmony," Brown said at the beginning.
The only black character that's a snake that gets white dog.
The producer of the Drazy White People asked finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the right to film; Damon insisted that their regimes "may eventually give us something we don't want."
After the debate was over, the social media exploded inconsistencies with Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni said a link to the writing clip, "Matt Damon jumped into the word of the only blackness in the room, so she can explain to her that the difference is so that it hurts."
Tweet got more than 5,000 tweets and 4,000 people since it was published.
Damon's comment comes at a time when precise racial representation in the media is in front of the social discussion.
After Michael Brown was murdered by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter arrest took a national effect and pressed on lawmakers and authorities to maintain discriminatory practices against color people.
In the context of Prince's song, he made remarks on the wedding, while he mentioned the album named in the category of the year during the presentation of the grammy price.
"Or they're still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, they're still important.
The latest leader Black Lives Matter presented a statement in response to the question of Fox News's identity, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered as a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," declared the leader.
Damon was recently listed on the list of dancers, producers and media potentials who were invited to the pope’s visit to discuss the appearance of the Catholic Church on the west.
Whether he accepted the call or he's already met with the pope, it's not clear.
"American Ninja Warrior has the first victory"
The professional watchmaker and pickup Isaac Caldiero became the first competitor to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and brought home a million dollars.
In the competition that just ended its seventh season, none of the competitors were able to overcome all obstacles to the track.
During the final season of the year, two men fought in the last car, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last stop was 30 seconds after more than 220 meters long.
Britten graduated as the first and it was within a set limit and became the first competitor in the American Ninja Warrior to overcome 4 forces, yet Caldiero won it with three seconds and the competition.
Caldiero gave a speech for the reportE! News immediately after his heavy victory and it was known that he is still in shock from winning the main price at $1 million.
"It's a wonderful feeling, I've never done more than $10,000 a year in my life," Isaac E! said in response to his victory.
"So suddenly... I can't even imagine what it will be like now."
The executive producer Kent Weed gave a talk in The Hollywood Reporter about the final process and why Britten doesn't get any reward and despite the fact that she became the first competitor that lost her.
According to the rules, this money is for those who lose it as soon as possible.
"If there are more competitors involved, the prize will get the best time," Weed said.
Although winning the main prize would change his life, Britten is at peace with his performance.
"I don't think he'd act like an asshole in me.
He's glad he was moved to achieve what he could.
He's got a hot reception from the fans.
He's a great guy and he likes his family.
For their children and their wife it's a disgrace."
Geoff told me, "If there were to be someone who could beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I win, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue to be the eighth season, which will begin on spring 2016.
The tigers from Detroit just walked through Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the tigers from Detroit, no other half of the season was just going through the rose garden.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are now located in the last place of the Central Division of the American League.
Only the tigers firmly rejected their defeat when they defeated Minesso in the morning game with a 5-4 solid result at the Target Field stadium.
The two missed the chance to approach the Houston Astros team and catch a second wild card in the U.S. league.
Even though only one night, for Detroit it was the return of the words to Z, which was so unapproachable for them during the second half of the season.
"To win is always fun and it doesn't matter what way," said manager Tygros Brad Ausmus.
The founder of the Tigers Alfredo Simon held his offensive act and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then joined another in the sixth and ninth shifts.
Simon (13-9) allowed resistance to 6 1/3 and 3 times.
It was his first third game of the last nine games.
"I want to end this year with convincing results," said Simon.
"It's hard to get into a game when you're often sitting on a couch and so I want to get to the game right now."
Tigró's pilot Victor Martinez struck three times and made two rounds and his first score from half of August.
For Martineze it was the first tribal game since the last red game in which he fought four times in a game against Seattle Mariners.
"It's a nice thing to do," said Ausmus.
"He seemed good at training, fired a lot better and gave him a chance to move it to the game."
With three rounds at the end of the seven shifts, the Second got the greatest chance of returning to the game.
Middle Pole Byron Buxton was replaced by two points on the left side of the game.
Right Polisher Aaron Hicks got a point thanks to the set-up flag, and Simon spent Brian Dozier before his left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy ordered his only rival Mauer and had before him the fireman Miguel Sana, who fired the sword and walked for two years and left behind Drew VerHagen's right behind him.
With two players on the target and chance at the remix in the second exchange, VerHagen was able to send a third meter over two years.
Plouffe's already won 27 beats over two years in this season and he's king of the ill-fated table.
Detroit supported nine shifts, Mauer got two downloaded points and Bruce Rondon secured 5-4 scores for Tigers.
However, this right has been awarded to Sana on three occasions.
Detroit took advantage of the benefits and got points at Phil Hughes's game.
The tigers obtained three lessons in the first two exchanges against the rights they had served, which resulted in more than a month's break due to the confusion of the subject words.
"I certainly didn't introduce myself to such a start," said Hughes, "but during the third shift I've already felt that I'm getting better."
After he put his effort into the first exchange, Hughes left one point to the second meter of Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the right polar J.D. Martinez came out of Victor Martinez, who was the first one to go through all the years.
Victor Martinez interrupted his series 0-21.
The third meter Nick Castellanos followed him on the right side of the game and pasted him for another period, but Victor Martinez was moved when he tried to jump on the third floor.
The tigers added in the second shift when their challenger James McCann and Colonel Anthony Gose got two and a single point and the resulting table lighted the score 3-0.
"That got us to the knees," said manager Twochat Paul Molitor.
"He didn't get the game very well, but he got it to the right place."
Hughes, who won in the number of overcrowds, ended in the third exchange without points and rewarded him with A.J. Ahter's rights.
Hughes ran away for three years, got six shots and four shots.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the real triggerer of Tygros, ended the game with a disease in the right arm.
He'll be cared for by Dr. James Andrews, who took care of Sanchez's arm in 2007.
Sanchez, which is on the list of wounded by the mussels caught within half of August, should enter the middle of the game.
Sancheze rewards left Daniel Norris who comes back after his injury and acts against the Two.
Since June 30, when Norris has been replaced by David Price's left-handed rival, he has scores 1-1 for 4 dogs.
However, since August 20th, he has not won it because of the heavy rain.
The tigers and the Twins play the third mutual game at the Target Field stadium in the middle.
Against Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) the Minnesotsk left-wing challenging Ervin Santana (5-4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for opening up the economy to a wider world
It is necessary to open up the economy to the wider world for boosting growth, said President Xi Jinping of the group whose task is to reform tomorrow's management.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open policies," said the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group for the Deepening of Global Reform.
The promotion of opening up at parental reforms adds new impetus and vitality, also providing new space for economic growth, Xi says.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including the negative list of regulatory access to the market, the release of border control policies, State support (SOE) to absorb private capital and reorganise the registration resident system.
The declaration indicates that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and companies that are beyond investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
This step is important because it will play a major role in the allocation of resources, the provision of a legal business environment and make the market more open, states a statement.
The government will also exercise free control over the powers delegated to companies and ensure that companies themselves will decide how to manage their businesses.
It is also stated in the declaration that China will be able to reveal new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for supporting regional growth.
In an attempt to open up the State-controlled sector, more areas will be opened up by private investors.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of foreign-funded companies and will provide them with better services," says the statement.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or for a "green card", thanks to optimization of requirements and simplifying the application process.
Lawyers' rights to practice and develop professional judges and state representatives were also included in the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and lead representatives Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In Karlovar's country, there may be a new bed room.
According to Jaku Panika (ČSSD), the current capacity of two national hospitals and two private hospitals in the country is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between individual hospitals.
But there are also opportunities to expand care.
For example, in the department of surgery, a single-day surgery centre could be established where, according to the set-up concept, the performance of surgical teams which do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours.
In which specific hospitals should be focused on one-day surgery, it is still unclear.
In the department of Karlovy Vary's skin, a laser center could also be created with the possibility of using laser techniques for skin disease.
The concept also recommended the establishment of an aplastic center to care for patients with brain gain who are in vegetative condition.
Such a centre should be centrally established and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological-resistance division.
There is also the possibility of centering such equipment into an island hospital where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity that is considered insufficient in Karlovar's country is the next bed for the next care, and in particular the Long-term Patient Treatment (LDN), whose capacity in Nijdka is insufficient and in particular should be referred to as the acute care bed.
Part of this device should work as a rehabilitative and part as a classic LDN sheet, recommends the concept.
As he warns, the next care bed is missing mainly in Karlovy Vary's hospital.
There they would be able to use abandoned buildings after centralization.
In the recent series in Karlovar's country, social health care is absent with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
This lie is lacking throughout the Republic, so it could also serve other countries as the so-called Alzheimer's Centre.
Hospitals should also be prepared for the introduction of so-called taxable levies to which European funds will be released.
"It is a bed that will be referred to as a range of specialised care and will create a room for patient translation after steps such as cardiosurgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other steps," describes the national concept of sleep care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
