Can't you use this camera to make me look good?
Yeah, and it's gonna happen.
The next day I went home to the Penguins, and suddenly the rain fell.
What's wrong with you?
In the mountains, you can see a beautiful sea.
You'll find out soon I'm going to be a bit nervous about this.
You can use the stars of your body, and you can get a clear view of it if you want to.
You're going to make it. I'll take ten minutes.
You don't seem to be a good guy to talk about.
"You're wearing a cow's neck?" "Soldier."
You're not gonna let me hide my scarf.
You don't trust each other.
It's better to burn before you feel it.
You're gonna have to sign this.
You're gonna drive to the next station.
If you don't want to try it, you're gonna have to work hard.
You're gonna have to pay for it by the end of May.
You'll learn how to swim.
You look so good.
You lied to your mom.
How long have you been here?
This room doesn't eat cigarettes.
You really don't think you're going to hit your teacher anywhere in the neighborhood.
You're never gonna make me do what I want.
You should do it right away.
You're my only hope.
You're making a lot of progress in English.
You're not hungry. You're hungry.
I'm sorry about what you've done.
Without your help, the plan won't work.
It's like you're a little old.
You've got your panties on your back.
You seem to know more about my hair.
You should be the first to get your electricity.
You're not supposed to kiss your mom.
You should be serious about threatening to be a painter.
You should listen to him.
You don't speak the world language?
I'm going home to Penguin and you're already out of your mind.
You're going to go to the United States, and you're going to pick up Japanese food.
