DFB Chief Grindel does not see any basis for Ozil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel does not currently see any basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the National Mission.
"This is a question which, of course, depends on one's coming into the discussion, that you also talk to him about why he has found it as obvious as it is in his state," Grindel said in the football podcast "Frasenmähr" of the "Image Zeitung.
Despite the monthly debate on the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the return of the 92-phase national player Ozil.
"I would have rejoiced if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I've also gone up to a certain point of time that would be like that," Greenel said.
The 29-year-old had explained his return from the DFB team in July and also justified his failure to defend him against racist attacks during the WM.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Ozil that this was not prepared for a discussion with German coach Joachim Löw and teamman Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build a print, but he knew it from the football so that "if one leaves a team or changes a team to talk about it with his trainer and I feel it's bad that this conversation has not been possible until now".
Linz: Garden huts in Schrebergertensitung burned
At 2.13 p.m., the professional fireman Linz was alarmed at a fire in the fireplace.
Because a high voltage guide directly leads to the Schrebergertensing site, there was a risk of delay.
The fire department came out and found the hall in full-burned.
The roof had to be removed practically and fire protection would be removed to an unprecedented extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden, he had picked up an battery to load by noon.
That could be the brandur case.
In any case, the charging device is based on firefire in the area of maximum fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire must still be detected - as is the case of the fire.
However, it must be significant because the owner had many collections in his garden.
Hot mother turns out: Lindsay Lohan acts as a refugee family on an open street
What has Lindsay Lohan done to this extremely remarkable action?
She wanted a alleged refugee family to bring the children in.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Full Loaded") has even streamed live as she wants a family in Moscow to openly join the children.
This reports the US-portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial average of the stream.
Here you see "For luck" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip it is seen how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly blind family that wants to be treated as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family runs right before the actor, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
It is concerned with the operation of adult child trafficking.
For all of this she doesn't provide any evidence in the Clip.
"The whole world sees it right," Lohan is listening in the video as she continues to follow the family along the street.
Obviously, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
Sometimes, however, it seems to be enough for the apparently hungry mother.
It looks like she's turning around and lohan's missing a watch.
Under the trains, the actor is wondering how she's shocked - and she's holding the flags.
What moved Lohan to this action is now completely unclear.

Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel task force still exists," said development president Peter Mertens to the "Automotive Week" section.
The arrested and authorized Audi Chief Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the task force will soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018 all motor/getty combinations are likely to be tested," he said.
Mertens now said: "In early July we reached an important milestone in the reconstruction of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the Diesel Canal at the Audi-Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer has taken "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never occur again.
On Friday, the VW Board of Supervisors had forgotten a decision on the future of Stadlers and wanted to discuss it further.

Grindel pursues re-election - Laham should be in the DFB Presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, despite the criticism of his person after the WM-aus and the Ozil-Affaire next year, wants to apply for the office as DFB President.
"I'm doing my job and I'm trying to make it as good as it goes," Grindel said as a guest early Sunday morning in the "Current Sports Studio" of the ZDF.
You have to try again and again, and I'll do it again.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the band was "marked" if he didn't want to work on the future project after the addition to the football-EM 2024.
Grindel has been the leader of the company of Wolfgang Niersbach since April 2016.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for the first full term of office of three years.
The next vote will take place on the DFB Bundesday of 27 September 2019.
The future EM Cheforganiser Philipp Lahm will work according to Grindel in the DFB Presidency.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he is also in this role in the future with consultation and then, of course, warmly invited to make his experience available on sports issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculations whether his successor could be DFB Chief.
As a consequence of the affair about the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkaya Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan, he expressed his desire that in the future a national player should become a DFB's integration messenger without a migration background.
At present this office of the Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, has last family roots in Cameroon.
"If a non-migrating background is clearly affecting society and football and says that "the issue is important because we need to take care of it", it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our societies in front of where integration needs to work," Greenel said.

Opened by Erdoğan Moschee in Koln
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the diitib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously visited his three-day state visit with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.
Criticism in Germany
In its opening decision, Erdoğan called on the German Government to deliver live subscribers to the Golden Movement in Germany and to oppose Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not be allowed to strike down our citizens and harm the German-Turkey friendship," he said.
For the opening of the diitib mosque, the Colner Innstadt was partially blocked.
Thousands of police officers were in use - among them were also guards.
The Ditib Islamic Union is in criticism because it is the longer arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: Stars, Buffs and Seconds
Musicers like Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have won a joint concert in New York Central Park for more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease.
"Engaging you wherever you can be," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night before around 660,000 spectators.
Thanks for coming here. It's a dream.
Cardi B stands in a red outfit with French and gold microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweaty, but it's okay, because I'm here and I'm ready to change the world.
Players such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations also showed themselves at the multi-hour show at the stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a second step when many viewers kept the sound of a falling metal stop for shots, got scared and tried to escape.
Soon panic broke out, people ran over each other.
Seven spectators were easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and the musician Chris Martin, however, calmed people down from the stage.
"No one tries to hurt someone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge every year on the Internet.
Those who wanted to get married had to read and distribute on the Internet texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and players, there was the public Jubel and Applaus - but for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
This, together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke on the stage for more equal rights of men and women.
On Friday, however, Fleke spoke as a judge at the U.S. Senate Committee on Justice for the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh as the Supreme Court’s judge, and this led to many women sitting in front of the head.
At least three women have raised abuse cases until they have been tried to rape Kavanaugh, which is reversing this.
Flake requested an FBI investigation into the cases after he was interviewed by two women who, according to their own data, had experienced sexual abuse on the way to the Committee's sitting in a raise.
"You may also like to meet with me at any time in a lift," says Fleke at the New York concert to the audience.
Press freedom: Federal Government defends the media
Government Speaker Steffen Seibert defended the draft of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In Kanzleramt, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had taken a T-shirt with the Turkish and German headline "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, if it wasn't the problem, said Seibert of the picture on Sunday.
There was an interruption of the suspension of the press conference.
Through the action of the journalist, there was a strong disturbance that was not acceptable.
That's why he's allowed security guards to bring the man out.
Sebiert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political position at press conferences in the Federal Chancellorate.
This shall be entirely independent of whether or not it is a legitimate claim.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are called for spy activities or support or membership in banned parties or the fetullah-gullage movement.
The Turkish leadership shall be responsible for the movement for the split trial on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists have spent several decades.
Foreign journalists are also not sure about the Turkish authorities: In early September the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Finally, the cases of the arrested journalists Meshale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had been taken care of.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but still processes against the two continued in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and well-known his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, it's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The "Inas Night" Talkshow produced by the NDR is known for soft talk at the Hamburg port doorknope "Schellfish Posts".
Moderator Ina Müller supports her guests on some beer, some wine or even high-percent drinks to attract voices and sounds.
Not a few promises are also used for mandatory sound inputs.
On Friday another consequence of the popular talkshow was recorded.
This time: actress Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "Men's Heart", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Worst Day".
The Münchner was able to travel in the high north but not well.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely zirconized, the eyes are only two small holes.
The Bet Selfie shows a fully-fledged Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he's got only a powerful cat.
To his fans, he posted some - perhaps not quite serious - recognitions he has now won: "Regular one: NIE goes to Inas Night.
Rule two: don't drink the black sauce.
And Spritz.
And the round iron liqueur, which smiles about half three, also leaves.
Alcohol consumption is actually written in the 43 years.
His fans also posted a few tips on combating violence.
They are due to instant breaks, fish breaks or - probably the most target - headache tablets.
Others were simply excited about the appearance of the normal attractive Kinostar.
As Ina Müller has survived the night shift, it is not known until.
Since it's modernising the TV space at Theke since 2007, the 53 years seem to be much more trying...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight vandalism and Unrat
The entrance to the 36 km long train route in Treysa is difficult to detect and relax.
Recipes against fatty vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly point out.
Scratch, cigarette chips, müll and unrat, demolized molleymers and medium-sized drawings - this is how long since the entry with seat group to the road on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented.
For the railway project in Rotkäppchenland, there is more than an improbable view.
The theme is for members of the ADFC Orts Group Schwalmstadt but also for a longer time, as the city's road transport officer Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the railway sector.
There's no solution until then.
The proposals are from the delegation of the sitting group to the regular disposal of waste containers and the cleaning of the areas at the entrance.
"I think that last time would be the offer of the hour - regardless of possible other activities," says Westenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been introduced into the local sector.
Not only does the Mull drive drivers and residents around - the seating group is at the end of a regular meeting to celebrate.
Not only is it very common to hear that the floors are also destroyed: dusting from the ground, demolition of the milling machine, painted paintings, painted seating furniture.
Volunteers have already been more and more spacious, according to ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the verbal attacks on the hot stone.
They boast that the station on the road in Treysa is a meeting point for storage.
"At the end of the entire railway road there is a clear focus on the Haaße hill," says the road transport officer who is now taking care of the new railway stations in Ziegenhain, which are opened today.
"It'll lead to the same destiny, it'll be really expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe it makes the threshold much higher to fit into community.
This would, however, require that a police station be conducted in the near future.
In principle, Westhaven wants to develop the Haaße hill.
He must be designed more attractive.
To date, the frequency of the road can be very satisfying.
The tourist market is still reliable.
Our route is very high in comparison with others in Germany," the ADFC members said.
As an extremely critical hazard site, ADFC member Susanne is estimating the situation in the Ascheröder Street in Treysa.
There's no escape trail on the Haaße hill.
In the case of traffic, it may be necessary for railways to wait in the middle of the road between the two-way traffic flow," she explains.
This is no problem for sports drivers, but perhaps for older people and especially for children.
Music-contest in the cultural train station: "Kö von Hiltrup" and the sea
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in the middle.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is called the appeal of the city-wide Hiltrup, in "Music Contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with eye irritation in the sympathical Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family partner in coffee and kitchens by the officials of the cultural center.
Seven formations include Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitars, Rolf Ihmig, a long-standing Hiltruptrum liveer, nine of the "Hiltruper Star Colors", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an assembly from the children's garden Lummerland and finally Rick Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't experienced this in other parts of the city yet.
Where did the texters come from?
The Hiltruper Sea and the Marketlee were particularly frequently mentioned in the places.
Rolf Ihmig briefed allee in his sleepy song to "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural train station has also been honored.
It was always about the experience of each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke lived the short rebuffs with short interviews with the interpreters or references to their creations.
So you learn from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now teach guitars.
Franke was known by Tontechnik Stefan Schemmelmann to report that he was in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic placed all his hands on YouTube.
"It's not about winning," said Franke.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomy.
However, for the interests of the jury there was something special - so that others could also hear their songs.
A whole CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianoist Marcel Untied with a soundwriter.
Other musicians can include a song: Immig with his hiltrup striker, who was especially impressed by his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two coaches at guitars and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
As all the children are at the finish line again - and even without electronic support "very good", as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to hiltrup, accessibility of melody and reconnaissance value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalia School for Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Union and Jan Kaven, President of the City of Illofensive.
The city-owned had called for the event because of its ten-year existence.
She valued the event as a complete success.
All of them are "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the very very full cultural train station.
The word-game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that represent each other.
For each page there is a view screen containing four cards with keywords that can be identified - the old trick with the red foil - only if you have hidden it.
This is how it is ensured that the opposite cannot read from sight.
On the map, for example, read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Wurfle.
Fest. "
These are the terms that still apply to the key.
Because it should be mentioned here, not the terms, but codes.
Differently a player per team is the locker.
He gets a code card, which may be "3.4.2".
The word "decrypto" should be used, not the terms behind the secret leaflet, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: he is to describe - in this series and in this example - the words "Wurf", "Fest" and "Window" - and so that his own team knows the correct sequences and the opposite team is not possible; for this will win the party if it is able to break the code twice.
So the locker notes and reads aloud: "Water" for the towers, "lose" as the opposite; of course there would also be something like "Party" and "Prag" because he has adapted to the school and knows the window structure there.
So it's going round for rounds, team for team.
Although you do not know the concepts of the opposite - this can be better aligned with any indication the key is there.
It is possible to be mysterious, but not to be turned away, so it should be so, otherwise it is unnecessary for his team.
The most cryptic of "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule height.
Players must probably study it for a long time and carefully until they can finally play it.
The explanation video under decrypto.info on the network makes it easier.
But whoever has just released will be fascinated by how much feeling is involved in this invisible game.
However, "Decrypto" is not as closed as previous and generation-primism "Codenames", which also leads an agent theme to a game of less words, but it is much better to play in small groups.
And who's just going for advice and not for winning points, who can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: A man shows the police Hitler size and charges guests in the Kneepe
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach twice on Saturday night.
First he showed the size of Hitler in the Upper City, and later he also appeared in the Upper City in a knot when he attacked other guests.
After clearly alcoholizing the assigned place by the police, he had to spend the night at the Kulbach police station.
In the latter case, he must also be criminally responsible for the use of signs of constitutional opposition organizations.
Business work Pressig was home of the Schublocks
The railway work in Presig has been the shipyard in Frankenwald for decades.
1991 ended a piece of railway history.
"When the buffer hit the buffer, it was heard in full pressig," recalls George Dinkel, who records the history of the place and the railway station.
It didn't happen to anyone.
There the brakes also rested and the wagons rolled.
That was just a train.
Statements that make sense for Dinkels Home Pressig.
Nowhere in Frankenwald was such a place by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the stylloppe mountain range to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 heights, has its skiing point in Steinbach on the forest.
To handle this, early training and shoes were needed that had their home in Presig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landday approved the construction of a railway station with 21 train stations, train stations, driving and train master.
"The bridge was the bridge that had a diameter of 18 metres after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, train historian and 47 years of professional train.
The railway company (BW) Presig, which was submitted to Bamberg in 1968, also operated Loks for the nearby sections of Presig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockholm - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported by a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed at the time in Presig.
The electricalization of the 1939 track has already reduced the need for train and ski lifts.
Since 1977 they have only been used for goods.
By 1991 there were still at least 10,000 walls in the month.
In 1982 parts of the work were broken down, 1991.
Heidrich: "It is sad that there is no better use of the site, even in point of freight traffic, in the eye."
At Pfingsten 1989, the Nürnberg Railway Directorate celebrated a "50-year Electrification Nürnberg - Saalfeld" in Presig.
"There were 10,000 interested viewers here," recalls George Dinkel.
Not later.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were expelled, the Rangerbahnhof Presig was history.
"The Rangers and Home Schoolers performed the most difficult work in transport," recalls Dinkel.
Each failure had fatal consequences.
Why the Presig Rothenkirchen railway station has led to the conversion of the hierarchy of both places and there are many more historical and current images here in the French Plus article.
Kerber with record records at China Open
Peking (dpa) - Wimbledonzier Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the Tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Cristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the World rankings is Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
On Friday 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kasatkina, when the Russians set out on number 13.
The Schwwabin is now able to do it with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition was opened on weekends in the "Art and Wellness" series.
With great relief, events and visitors were able to watch the ideal weather when, in the open space of the presence of Dahlmann-Smidt, midtelehrenbach, the special Vernissage "Windsplay-performance" was opened.
It is located under the roof of the "Rund About Walberla" in the "Art and Beauty" series.
These opened their ports in the 15th year.
A large audience expressed the excitement of the exhibition.
21 Examples of 20 artists are now to be visited in Central Bank.
Mr. Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists for opening the Vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like People Hahn, who also made a name as the main organizer and artist alike.
Something surprising but Hahn announced his return a few days ago.
With Tania Angels and Kurt Neubauer, he placed his task in a secure, young hands with a good outlook for the future.
Both in the past have been actively involved in the selection of artists and produced flyers.
In this year there is also one of the 70 cent special stamps designed by Art & Gains, available at each art station.
There you can also design this year's poster "Betzn away" by People's Hahn for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high demand for the special exhibition.
For the musical performance, Max Marcus Stadler was able to win from Nürnberg.
As you walk through the magnificent garden, it will soon become clear to the visitor that the title "Windsplay-performance" is officially required by the artist's imagination and ultimately brings to the attention of the visitor.
It is art works of metal or ceramic, often provided with color accents.
Already at the entrance of the presence, the visitor is waiting on the right side of the "Happy Tree" by the artist Werner Bour, Eschenau.
It is a wooden tube, colorfully painted, playful with 20 windscreens, 24 lifts and 24 alu wheels as soundpieces.
With the sun passing through the bushwork in the background, the object seems to have been marked and invites to be removed.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers in three-dimensional letters to the event for 15 years K&G.
There are many parts in the wind moving.
Halfway, Siegrid Frey from Eckental published her work "The Wind The Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his great fantasy images of tone, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windsplay-performance" was introduced by the diverse art exhibition.
Until 31 December 2018 the special exhibition can be visited.
50 years MGV 68 Albums: Songs celebrate 50. Birthday fixed
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And the albatross also made their unmistakably air at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to find out at all that after the resolution of the church church "Cécilia" there should be no more life in the city.
It has become a legend: At a bank in Tinnenbusch they raise the MGV 68 albums from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the Jubilee was celebrated large in the "House of Meeting".
"It will be completely today," said President Jürgen Holstie, and he should keep his right.
150 guests had a real success for the Albache singer.
They had given themselves to the Jubilee to relive the foundation festival.
It's been a tradition for years, and then there was a break.
At the age of 50, the traditional party was back there.
An elegant ball became the first to be prayed for solid clothing.
The guests don't sit in "house of encounter" in sit-in rows, but kindly at tables.
Meanwhile, movement was said: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottullen drew up the rules and pointed at the dance area.
It is a matter of honour that the singers from the MGV 68 albums let themselves hear the voices.
Assassinous songs were spoken.

Volleyball: 3. Women's League: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The climber marches.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Monster under the control of Axel Büring is located right in Liga three.
No trace of shoes or francs, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) was really good against city-competitor BW Aasee.
"That wasn't clear, but we've already left impressions," says the somewhat satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately volunteered: "It's a disaster with which we can live very well.
We're not satisfied." On the contrary.
At night at a nightly birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game stopped.
Yes, the result is actually an optical shift.
In the third floor, the guests had a satzball.
"If they bring it to the target, they can already kick a game," says Büring from years of experience.
Finally, the USC, with its routinely powered forces, made everything clear and brought full enjoyment to the goal.
"We all know who's in such a Derby on the other side.
That doesn't make us the genius.
I've seen really good volleyball at the stage," Annacker didn't have the 0:3 and went around to the agenda.
Where the journey is for the independent, it does not seem to be visible after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
He just feels like, "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
This is not closely compared with regionallagi volleyball."In the four Leagues they do not want to turn their view any further down.
If the west is not contaminated in the next few weeks, they must look up.
A first balance, however, can only be taken after 10 or 11 parties.
On Saturday, it's the first time I'm going to Emlichheim.
Aasee will meet at Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the dream ship Heide Keller became the star.
Now she speaks openly that the series may have been guilty of her marriage with Hans of Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Dramship" Heide Keller (76), but on January 1, 2018 she went from board forever.
The series they left at the start could be responsible for their divorced marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she had been married for ten years.
"That could also be a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveling alone with a suitcase around the world, and many of my fellow colleagues took me to a high point, Keller says in his conversation with the "Picture on Sunday".
At first, she was just "the woman of Hans von Borsody" but this changed with the dream ship.
Because now the journalists are only calling on Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he felt so good about it."
It makes it possible for her husband to be extremely needy, but "as many men also broke up his conversation about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried for Hans of Borsody's "the only one who was right and he wanted to know my anguish, not my weaknesses.
This is in good German: I've lost myself," she further explained.
She's always had the feeling, "It's not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who I had never been in the truth, even though I sometimes looked curious and brave on the stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously divorced marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "though I was afraid that it could also happen again".
On the day before the standoff, I was standing in the garden and wanted to say everything.
So did Borsody's marriage.
Why didn't you blame the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller's love was then "as presented in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not all-day.
I'm too naive to get to love."
The nightfall that regularly explored the nightlife of the city in the NZZ district of Zurich has been waiting for the ZFF opening party this time.
Our loss is not a move, but a little light.
And the gray glanze, in which a green carpet is washed on the sex scene, blinds him to the price.
But it's a long film festival, as more or less famous people want to celebrate in the skylight.
This late Thursday evening, he turns over the place to make it easier in the "Aquaclian-WC-Oase" soon.
The public toilet facilities sponsored by a large health company, which celebrates their prizes at the festival, are called the necessary equipment in the area of a new Pavilion.
On this evening, however, the Lord's ocean is frozen for some reason to heaven.
So out here, on the other side of the road: Loaded guests who held the opening movie "Green Book" in the cinema just at a certain level celebrate the festival every year with a party in the three-story shopping house.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: From all the earthballs are known for the works shown .
What must not be done with an article about this festival in order not to fall into ill-treatment for the 190 partner companies.
The falter binds himself with a bandage around the sensor that has attached a good fee to him, and two blind doorkeepers are really generous here.
Inside, the fans are forced to dance long after midnight to live music or are allowed by DJ rhythms, which they call each other, and play with Cüpli exquisite hips.
In the delicacy shop in the Southrain, outsiders are waiting on sleeping lips, in addition to the countless redschenchen Culatello di Zibello will be cut off freshly, spraying a chocolate fountain.
And the hammer is: All sales rules are completely exclusive products are not covered for the admission.
That's how it has been for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The falter studies the picture at the roll stand: "Take a long dress, please be careful about the roll stand".
If the two specific instructions were to be, he would have disappeared in the dresscode.
But it's rather a conditional construction, and it's probably already saved life.
In the department of household goods in the upper room, the birds pick up a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the Festival Award.
The price for the best drink is obtained by this mix, which presents itself to a capseller, not necessarily.
And George Clooney, who's been working for busy brands for years, isn't here at night either.
There, however, between local government, casino and kitchen articles, there is a face that is familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, director of the opening film.
He mustn't be far away from his main producer.
And really: Viggo Mortensen is equally spaced, soon becoming almost like a cocknabe, by the amount.
He's not being affected, he's not being treated, he's going to be shot at the highest.
Just for this back-up, who likes to misunderstand as a credulity, international stars love this film party.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Trainer and Ex-Futzballstar Diego Maradona rejoices over the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have played well in his new home in Mexico.
After a two-0-winning Dorados de Sinaloa Club, 57 years old coaches danced with a player in the cabinet about Cumbia-Rythmen, as is seen in a video already released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a crew member Maradona dances in the yellow-coloured tricot, burned by the players.

Handball: Linkage 1: ASV Send to Last Minute Pleite "on the ground destroyed"
Sven Bieletzki, Coach of the ASV Handball Link Lister, could hardly understand it: "So a bit lower." His guards were "damaged on the ground" after the accident at 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday at LIT Germany 2.
They didn't play bad on long phases, the senders.
Only the beginning phase "we've been totally asleep", the U.S.S. trainer glorified himself.
Soon the household heads led by 8:1, even the early departures that Bieletzki had taken, did not first produce.
"But then suddenly a walk went through the team," Bieletzki concluded the second quarter hour together.
For the rest of the rest, the retreat was only two more doors.
In particular, the best of send, Marius Hintze, met again in the phase.
After the change, it was even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David looked out at 15:15, followed by the staff officer almost passed.
Four minutes before the Sirene, the origin still seemed to be three calming encounters (29:26).
And then?
Take the inpartials into the case.
Bieletzki usually avoids looking for debt to others.
But: The 120-second-time punishment, by Stephen Mühlhof, "was a white".
LIT had been well laughed and hit up to the end four more times - during the last defeat of the U.S.A.V.
The boys have fought great, they've also been good at the back of seven men and they've always thrown it on an empty door.
Only they can buy a little for the compliments.
"Now there must be a fucking victory here," said the restless Bieletzki.

As a result, Tesla would be estimated at $72 billion in total.
Later, the muscles rolled back: Tesla remains on the chest.

Questions: 46% do not want brands until 2021 as chancellor
After the last week's rounds, GroKo casts several questions deep down.
The SPD falls into a question behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The AfD has taken over the SPD for the first time in the Emnid Sunlight for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD is estimated to be 17 per cent, which SPD has a point of 16 per cent compared to the previous week.
CDU and CSU also lose a number and only 27 percent.
This is the most profound value for the Union in the solar system.
The greens reach 15 percent, the links 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
On Sunday, the government parties would receive SPD, CDU and CSU according to Emnid only 43% of the votes.
As a result, the great coalition has now lost most of its solar demand in all major research institutions - except Allensbach.
The government parties come from 43 to 45 per cent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 per cent).
At the German election in 2017, they received 53.4 per cent.
In the other parties, the band size is also large: the AfD, in several surveys, is 15 to 18 per cent.
The greens reach votes from 12.5 to 17 per cent.
The link is on average 10 percent, FDP on 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such questions vary from 2 to 3 per cent above and below by volume.
But also the return for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has been significantly reduced since the German election in 2017.
Only 48 percent of the citizens are currently finding that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellor, as the Emnid poll in the order of BamS.
Only every second (50 per cent) wants the survey to date that the large coalition will hold up to the next regular federal election in three years, 41 per cent are for a new election.
Also in a further survey published on Saturday, there were significant public interest rates for brands.
The Germans also consider whether Merkel should apply for the CDU presidency again in December.
47 percent are said to be Emnid, 44 percent against.
As a result, 64 per cent of the Union's citizens do not want a candidate, 35 per cent do not.
Advantage of Aldi: Reduced to Love's Happiness
Aldi will be at Tinder 2.0?
Who says, in times of Tinder there is no more romantic knowledge stories - which should be kept up with Aldi once over meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fastfood dating" by Tinder and Co., the Supermarket as a place of knowledge for the great love almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced chicken meat, boxer short shoes on the wheyboard or the lovelings pudding is still a better story for the later single children than a mere right swap.
The Tinder app is in the process of being less a contact, but more often a sleek bear.
We've been waiting for the test: How do women react, but not long ago in the first message about the hot width?
Here's the amazing result.
A regular Hollywood love story potential has it when love's happiness precipitates an out-of-eye loss-and-recovered plot.
If the type still reports under the e-mail address bio-putenflesch@gmx.de at his bidder, then it sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this ad in an unknown Aldi branch that she will want to find her dreamer with whom she has recently kept over the "30 percent reduced bio-punt meat".
For her belief in the magic of analogous knowledge, she earned her Happy End à la Hollywood in any case.

Football: Bizirksliga: Researcher's appearance of VfL Wolbeck against the SC Alternhrheine makes Mut
There were moments in this young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his heart.
Wortkarg gave himself the coach of the VfL Wolbeck football field list, first went back (in) to think about the lack of performance on the green.
All history.
In the meantime it's going around the fireplace again.
Water-free housing is 1:1 a.m. against the SC Alterraine, in the past game time only high-dendenthsed on the rise.
Yeah, I'm very satisfied with the appearance.

This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and sought out every individual after the party to say evil "Thanks" for so much opposition against the ambitious guests.
In this case, the train had to perform a system configuration within 26 minutes.
After the destruction of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came to him - from the 4-4-2 immediately passed into a 4-2-3-1, where Niklas Thewes was waiting in front of the ball.
Wolbeck had much more toys in the first section.
And Chance.
But Frerichs before him (17), who replaced Luca Rehberg (26) and Jan Schroer (38).
It must have been thought that the SCA in minute 41 was twice in person by Kevin Fullrath and Chris Naberbbaumer dangerously before the Wolbecker Castle - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be master of his profession.
After the break the VfL quickly took full control.
Thewes 18 meters apart.
Schroer also came back 58 minutes later at a Thewes survey.
With the exchange of Miles Geske, fat on the left side once again lost a fresh cell course.
As an Altenrheine Chris Naberbbaum in the 70s. Minutes of Robin Westues, there was an indirect free pass for the local owners 18 meters before the guesthouse.
The guilt itself emerged and demonstrated its danger at standards.
Westhouses" Things with the right sleep fell down to the left in view of the protection - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes to be fucked up.
And then this: VfL Captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80s. Minutes of the suffering in the punishment unfortunately came to hand.
Judge Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately showed the point.
Jannis Schneider did not leave the gift (79).
A few minutes ago, Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase, before geske in 87 minutes from 12 meters but still had the victory hit on the chest.
Maybe it was too much good.

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rare entity in corporate presidents
Only 8 per cent of the presidents were women on Friday 1 September, as outlined in the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented this month by the Allbright Foundation and submitted by the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to be set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will go through them," said Wiebe Ankersen, director of the Foundation.
In the United States, Britain or Sweden, purely malely employed leadership teams - with few exceptions - are no longer possible.
The decline makes the German competitors less diverse, innovative and forward-looking.
It's another business culture.
In addition, the small increase in women's share among German mining companies is only to return positive incentives to the company's index of medium-sized value (MDAx).
Although according to Allbright, only 6.8% of the presidents are women.
In the previous year, however, the value remained at 3.8 per cent.
In the 30 Dax companies - in the past few years, the women's share has been stagnated.
Last 26 women worked in the presidents.
"I'm sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again next year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signalled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the share of "null percentage" until now.
Another picture is on the surveillance board: On September 1, there was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 men less than a year ago.
"On an annual basis, as many women have been recruited for presidents, 40 per cent would have been achieved by the year 2023," says the report.
Some even make men: Luxury cars: Which manufacturer deserves most of the car?
The best worth of Ferrari.
The Italians take every Ferrari 280,000 euros sold and make 69,000 euros operating gains.
Large cars, big profits: This slogan still applies - in most cases.
Who among the noble suppliers is making most of the profits per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers buy by car that they sell?
This question has been addressed by "Autopapists" and economic Professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows: The differences are massive.
Ferrari made in the first half of the year with every car sold 69.000 euros operating win - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, is only about 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley, even in each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices from €33,000 to €38,000 per car and around €3,000 for interest and tax EBIT.

"It's nice that so many have found the way back to us after the wind." Later, "The Troglauer" made sure to vote.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the Union had fixed the drinking prices on the afternoon of the Jubilee 60 years ago.
A festival is held on Friday, 5 October, in the guest's house, just a day later in the festival.
In Bonn: Notarzutato power in Taxi
A notary vehicle is very damaged along a road.
A 27-year-old passenger has been killed in the collision of the vehicle with a taxi.
If nostrors are called, they should help save lives at the best.
Such a rescue journey took place in Bonn a deadly end for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - At the collusion of a notary car with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian was killed in Bonn.
The taxi drivers, the notaries and their drivers were severely injured, as reported by the police.
On Saturday afternoon, the 46-year-old driver of the Notarztato had passed a red ampel with blue light and Martinshorn.
Then he sat on a cross with the taxi that ran at Green.
After the collusion, the doctor slammed against a apple mask and a tree.
He found out about the passenger who died in the accident.
Motor vehicle and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the notary vehicle were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from use forces.
The 29-year-old notärztin who was also severely injured was able to free himself, but the footman could no longer help her.
Another named Notarzt tried this - however, without success.
The three seriously injured were brought to hospitals.
The police are in agreement with the Bunner State Service, who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we find it uncomfortable
After the flashback from the Ligacup, Manchester United is now lost in the 7th round of the Premier League.
To West Ham United, ManU 1:3 is underway. The type and manner of landing must still be discussed.
Apparently the scene was in the 74. minutes in which the repeated Marco Arnatovic for West Ham shot the 3:1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had led the Red Devils back to the game.
As they suspected an offside of Mark Nobel’s pass, all the reverse players from Manchester remained standing, and Arnautovic spent all the time in the world, pre-selecting the ball on the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative height point of an already far-reaching performance.
It is quite different today at the U.S. City Trivale Manchester City.
The great competitors Pep Guardiola trained by Mourinhos came against Brighton & Hove Albion into an imperishable 2:0 victory.
After a half hour, Raheem Sterling first crossed the sideline of the outside team.
Sergio Aguiro took care of a good hour and a double pass with the formal protection for securing the sixth victory in the seventh game, as well as for the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leaders
Three days after the 1:2 landing in Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought with Liverpool in the Premier League a 1:1 against Chelsea.
As in the Cup-Aus, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The encounter of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained until the final stage of the only hit of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in 66. minutes for Mohamed Salah, lost the balance almost again after 70 minutes.
It was better for Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute with his scarf.
After the talks were started with an unprecedented balance in the week, Chelsea was not to be hit the second time.
First the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, and through the remiss in the League, the Blues Liverpool was still running from the table.
As City also celebrated the two London City Clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) 2:0-wine.
The fans of the Gunners, where Grant Xhaka played, however, had to endure a message of success against the surprise team from Hertfordshire's funeral.
Nine minutes before the closing, Watford Verteriger Craig Cathcart accidentally knocked Alex Iwobi into his own door, just two minutes later, Mesut Özil took care of his third season sacrifice for the decision.
Arsenal went through the fifth victory following Watford and lies right behind the huge Rivalen Tottenham on Rank 5. A strong impression is still left under the rise of Wolverhampton under his Portuguese trainer Spirito Santo.
At 2:0 against Southampton in the League, the Wolves remained unbeatable for the fifth time and placed the 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Paris Car Salon in the sign of the Diesel debate
The Paris Car Salon is held every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially, there is no topic, and yet at present: The Channel and the Ring for Road Prohibitions and Restructuring should not be allowed by the German car companies at the meetings of the industry in Paris.
At Car Salon 2018 they show their news from next week together with competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel does not really play a big role anymore.
The possible exchange and post-mortem offers for Diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be dealt with with by the government in Berlin, however, should be at least an important subject behind the bright corners of the exhibitions.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other girls, but not with the VW core brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there, including their first pure electric models: The Ingoll City's e-tron should be on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgarter 2019.
Both were officially presented but already.
The iNext of BMW should start only 2021.
At the centre of Paris is the new 3rd.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented in this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcyclists as well as numerous mobility services and software providers are present in each of their own halls.
The event, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016 a million visitors arrived.
At least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi during the heavy earthquake and the following tsunami.
Thousands are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injuries.
On Friday, the island was devastated by two earthquakes.
The first baby had the strength of 5.9, the second of the strength of 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, there have been huge damage.
After the baby, the Tsunami took over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a party.
It is feared that the payments will still go to a very high level.
The numbers are still from Palu.
However, there are also numerous other communities - along the Sulawesis West Coast.
About 150 Bike Celebrations of God’s Service in the World
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the completion service for the motorcycle driver in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday.
Werdohl - The place before the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcycle drivers on Sunday.
The final service for the biker was always on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the evangelical church of Westfallen and therefore is responsible for the soul-surgery call of the PS-strong two-wheeled drivers.
Between April and September, the last Sunday of a month of the traditional motor freight service (MoGo) will be held at the house of Nordhelle.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated by the Biker in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There were about 150 Bikers assembled on Sunday to pursue anything other than regular service to God.
Since 10 o'clock, the Bolidens have been running before the church's entrance portal.
At first the biker breakfasts were on the program and it was possible to be strengthened with coffee and kitchens or even with a firm coursewart.
In addition to the MoGo team, there were the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach.
The sermon was held during the Bicker Goods Service of Father Dirk Grzegorek.
The Singer-Songwritin Valerie Lill provided for musical interpretation.
"Although the bikes prefer the Blues Rock, Valerie Lill suggests more poetic-slow tone," said Father Frank Schröder.
This too must have been a novel in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Führer Hometimer celebrates a great feast: After the apple comes the milk
And also on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She cared for her hungry guests with freshly prepared apples.
Great interest also aroused George Hartmann-Niemerg.
He had his appeal pressure in the package and demonstrated his standing audience step by step the process from higher appeal to appeal.
Then and when Hartmann-Niergerg left the children the field and let them fill the apples in the big chairs.
With a little muscle force from the apples, it became a finely scaled mass.
Many of the children may not yet have been able to imagine how one should be a tasteful drink.
However, they could also see this important step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and covered by nets, George Hartmann-Niemerg made up a small piece of aperture layer for layering together.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed satisfactory went on and on in a big bag.
However, the farmer had already completed specialties.
So he opened his "Schatzkist" and presented the oldest visitors with the latest federal whites.
The demand for the good troupe "Made in Fuchtorf" was relatively large.
In a pleasant atmosphere, the parents came to the discussion, while the children were not only able to follow the appelpression process but also discovered the built-in hipburg for themselves.
Also active by the Führttors Cameradade of former soldiers engaged in short-term games in the framework of the party and played at some stations.
The homeowner will also be offered a day of action next year.
Then, as Gregor Krützkamp stressed, it will not be the homehouse in the heart of the spargel village of the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also due to the topic on hand: Finally it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth season Pleite: "Best situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga sub-position, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professor from Hannover 96 to speak to them boldly.
However, there were many positives to see at 1:4 (0:2) of the table at Frankfurt entry.
"It's a difficult situation, but you have to get out of there as a man," said 96-football Prof. Primin Schwegler and said, "That's of course surprising, because you're always taking too much."
The further sailing Dutchmen, for whom only Florent Muslija (86th) came into contact, are standing with two figures all the way down and are a candidate in their current constitution.
According to the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated in spite of the first season’s home page.
Evan Oite Nicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) reached 46,300 spectators for the DFB poker winner who, following the successful general test for the European league game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle field of the table.
Croatia's Vice-Montenegro Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of the horses at his start-up debout and never received by Hannover Abwehr.
After the WM, the long-acted stormer showed his time and resources why he is so valuable to the entry.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan FC Liverpool was the first time in the early formation of Frankfurter, who started singing.
One of Lucas Torró's first shots on the tortoise.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last time of the 96th anniversary of the Brazilian Philippines, which replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for household owners was almost strong and worth it.
Filip Kostic took the ball after an abandoned corner in the strategist, Haller extended by head before the door where Nicka just needed to hold the foot.
It was the first federal event for the French double-list AJ Auxerre who came in the summer.
And Frankfurt was still in front of the break.
This time Haller adapted to Rebic's storm partner, who was able to think and 96-to-date Michael Esser left no chance.
In half-time Hanover-Coach responded to the weak image of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces into Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Dutch people were now playing something more courageous than ever before, but the idea of sin remains short before the end, as it has always been.
The horses were much more efficient.
After a few hours, Rebic started a solo and then placed it on De Guzmán, which had to throw the ball into an empty tower.
The rest was only a walk for the Frankfurter against the oppressed guests, and Jovic was still a minute before the end.
The Morlaix place is going to party.
Despite cold temperatures, well-being prevailed at the October festival in the city.
The Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter created a million-year-old audience at the opening of 185.
München Wies'n last week with two shots.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Saint-Kreuz-Fest
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross festival on 14 September or on Sunday.
The Fine Service takes place in the City Church, then a process for the Holy Cross Church is completed with the end of the season.
The Holy Cross Church is hosted by the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year-old war and is supposed to have shot on the legend after a Swedish soldier.
And then blood flowed out of the shell.
This led to the development of a great pilgrimage to the fallen Christ, which also led to the construction of the Holy Cross.
This is not completed until today, only the altar stands, the missing house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, trust and life.
The service of God was badly visited despite the importance of the Father’s Fathers.
After the service of God, the process of the Holy Cross took place and with the seal ended the church part of the cross.
For many years, the Catholic Church has been becoming part of the festival in the Catholic parish.
The chormit members provided visitors with tasty food as well as a large selection of kitchens and the weather, farm yard.
On the following afternoon, the parish council also held meetings around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmidt-Siger informed the visitors about the damages to fassade, roof, sandstone and windows, as well as the next construction measures that will be drawn up until next year.
After some time, the damage could be precisely identified and the individual expressions prepared more specific.
It is certain that the renovation will come as planned, because the damage already present some years ago has become greater, but it has also been more determined, which has only been made possible through the introduction of noise.
Sockelperputt works are completed, before the winter they are to begin with the works of nature, and it is hoped that half of these work will be completed this year.
Location: New residence in the New Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life assistance Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münster-based street.
That "a very special house" will now be passed on in the Münsterbrückstraße - since at the time of accession, all those present were certain.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers who have been living in the home of the life aid Donau-Iller have been living for some time pointing to the special architecture of the new building.
More walks, floors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army officer building was put on the front for the residents with phonecap: "The house had arrived in the years and no longer in the equipment," recalled Bader.
In 2016 the baker came back to clear the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that its inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, as is the architect.
Life-help Donau-Iller opens a new home
About 4.6 million euros were invested in the Neubau.
The fleet was driven to EUR 2.4 million, the area of Swaben 450000.
The construction works are based on architect Bader in the planned framework - both on time and financially.
For this too, he was thanked by Jürgen Heinz, the manager of the Life Aid.
The spagat between a barrier-free and at the same time fireproof buildings were not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and manual workers had built a home with many standards that allowed the inhabitants to enjoy freedom to move without foreign aid.
Similarly, the director of the social administration of the Swaben district, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is focused on the special needs of its residents who need the resources to be mobile."
If the apartment and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The basic thing in this position is a real accident because it is no longer to be acquired in today's situation."
In total, the new residence in the Münsterbeckstraße offers approximately 1500 square metres of space for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three housing groups.
Stolz is LifeHelp Manager Heinz on the 11 full-time forces that are employed at all prices.
Germany: Swiss Apologize Differences Between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of the unit, the Vice-President, Manuela Schwesig, has called on all the peoples of the country to refrain from joining East Germany.
There are differences that affect the unit after nearly 30 years.
We cannot be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the "Day-to-day mirror".
The goal must remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked longer than people in West Germany, but 15 percent less.
"I can't explain that to anyone nearly 30 years after the German unit," said Swiss.
North Korea: Does this filthy dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan Jagdhund is to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax the relations with Seoul, Pjøngjang has given the South Korean President Moon Jae in two North Korean Pungsan Jagd dogs.
As Moon's office reported on Sunday, the two dogs reached their recipients by about a year old on Thursday.
They then passed the Panmunjom border with three kilograms of dog feed to facilitate the "enlightenment".
The dogs with the thick white field, sharp ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national culture of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship offer had announced to the north at the third summit this year between the moon and the North Korean Machthaber Kim Jong and mid-September in Pjøng.
Both countries also agreed to join together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply together for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the opposite approach, Kim also wanted to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket operations.
History moved by Austria in mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100-year anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in the Middle Ages nearly ten months ago, a number of new books have appeared, most of which have been answered in the past hundred years.
On the other hand, it is Wolfgang Maderthan, historian and director general of the Austrian State Archive, which will appear on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for government
Back to work - this is how the informal motto of the Great Coalition begins today's work week.
Nearly an interview, almost a speech in which the Chancellor and their ministers from CDU, SPD and even the CSU have not voiced the "return to business" in the past.
This may have led to the right question of some workers, doctors, cashiers and other professional citizens in this country, which is actually the difference between work and business, but it is not.
If the Federal Government is now so far as to devote itself to its task - to the Government - it should not be left out of the debate on this matter.
If the Union and the SPD can actually contribute something together after the provocations and blogs of the last few weeks, it will be possible to show it on Monday.
In the evening, the tops of the government parties will be joined by the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to call these rounds on a regular basis to resolve conflicts early; a lesson from all the conflict.
First of all, however, there are still issues that are controversial in the agenda with the diesel pipelines and the change in power.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let car companies with exchange premiums come forward glidingly, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in charge of the technical repair of older diesels.
The Union and the SPD are still very different in their planned exchange of expertise between them during the crisis over the past week.
The SPD requires a living perspective for retired asylum seekers who work or train.
The Union is strongly opposed to the 'study change' from the asylum system in the labour market.
So there's going to be a conflict between the coalition partners again - and how else should it be?
Not equal and equal has joined Groko, but three partners with very different forms of society and priorities.
The fight is good.
Without conflict, a society that is so diverse, yet conflicting interests does not go ahead.
In order to be constructive, however, conflict must not be built up again for participatory reasons on the question of its being or not being.
It's still about politics, not the theatre.
The Union and SPD should fight – but they still have the reality of human life.
What's makeable and useful to many?
With this lead question, both the Diesel and the Spor exchange question can be explained pragmaticly - and thus gain confidence.
In particular, the People's Party must now fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the Visitor
Does the Minister of Labour count against the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Actual day and night," their legislators had been working on social security reform, reported an excessive social minister at the presentation of themselves two weeks ago.
At the list-Pilz-Mandater Daniela Holzinger, Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is surprised – she is now bringing the matter up by a request to Parliament.
It states that "the Minister only wanted to express his interest in the use of his team and that he did not want to report any damages to the current right of service before the current camera".
Nevertheless, they now have questions to ask about how hard it is to "free ourselves from any suspicion".
Police are looking for women on a street
Marxgreen - Long time the police didn't want to be out there.
There's a confirmation now.
Since early Saturday morning, it is buried on the state street between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is still closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It was predicted that the investigators had used an archeology dog before.
The dog specially trained for the use of old human bones, together with its leader, was finally able to limit the relevant position to a few metres.
In addition, a landanomalia was discovered with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the supreme Bavarian mental protection authority in the area of the road area concerned.
For more than a year, State administration and criminal police have been working on the missing.
In Marxgrün a railway was stopped again and tested with sonar equipment because the investigators suspected that this could have been broken by Heike's body 30 years ago in the course of the construction of the state street.
Colorful powder and eggs: Krawals in Barcelona before Catalonia Year Day
On Monday, the disputed independence referendum in Catalonia will be held for the first time.
But it's already coming to Krawall before.
The separatists have not forgotten the police presence of the autumn of 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan referendum on independence from 1 October 2017, it came to the center of Barcelona to meet between separatists and the police.
Catalonian security forces were attacked by independent defenders, including color powder, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of national police and civil protection.
About 3,000 police officers from the police units Policía Nationala and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues with a customer award, who were used in the elections during the last year by the illegal referendum.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from voting, it was also violent at the time.
The Catalan police had set up a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the national security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the approximately 6,000 separatists had then tried to break the police tickets by force, and the officers were also armed with dyes and eggs.
Six persons were arrested, 24 others were injured, and the authorities were summoned.
On Monday, the referendum on independence will be held for the first time.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision on the closure of the prosperous region of Spain, the Central Government of Madrid, in autumn 2017, had put pressure under control.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, flew into exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
Several ministers of the regional government at the time and other activists of the separatist movement are still in U-Haft.
In December, Newhallen was detained in the region.
After the office of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Kim Torrra is also on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberlagi Westfallen: Collected Wireless: FC Good luck and RW Ahlen separates completely
Red-white Ahlen is still on the spot.
Even in the FC, it is only possible to make a 0:0 difference.
The final light and the third came out 438 spectators at the Heidewald Stadium as a collection of councillors.
The first half was readily visible from the maintenance factor.
Anyone who wanted to get a beer or a broth could do this without worry.
There was no risk of losing a torchance because there was virtually no one.
First Committee after half an hour
For the first (harmless) assembly of the entire party, Nick Flock was appointed to be responsible in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle also the only real - had the opportunity of the adhesioners when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Towert Frederic Westergerling was forced to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the border.
The guests were even more hormonal.
Their most effective action was in an early exchange.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged for him, Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the growing long distances.
In 48 minutes, Sebastian Mützel, 18 meters above the house, and after an hour, the lodger also appeared first.
After a baller assault by Matthew Wieckowicz it went fixed.
The attractively mentioned county of Sinan Aygün "kronte" Nick Flock (62.) with a shot into the arm of RWA-torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they followed a football game by Wieckowicz (66.) after an Eckball by former alener Tim Manstein.
RWA inter-trainer Angelo Daut first responded to Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60) and something later Ones Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70).
It didn't work.
More than optical transparency, thanks to their own initiative, the athelers were not able to cope.
It was only in 91 minutes that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but neither did it.
Angelo Daut tried yesterday to stress the positive: "I like that we played zero." But unfortunately the zero also stood ahead.
"We were not as dangerous this time as we were against woodwoodwood and although our opponent had no pleasure in playing here," noted RW Ahlens Interimtrainer.
Offensively "protected everything so little" against a team, "that just wanted to defend.
Anyway, I didn't feel like we could get an agent," says Daut.
However, as an observer, he did not feel like his team could shoot a tower.
For this, the idea was too important.
Reckenfelder Ertentankmarkt: There are enough creamers for good luck
The Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler are pleased to receive a table of issues for which these fees are fixed.
The officials guarantee: "These expenses also remain in Reckenfeld".
To open up the sky appeared bright blue, the place was still empty, but this should still change over the course of the day.
Because, "Here's such a nice place to live, so we're here today," said one visitor.
The director of the party Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with an excellent price of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, who should actually be focused on food, short-term Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer are starting.
The Verena (the daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "resatz" was not allowed to take place between musically keeping the increasingly growing visitors.
This came so well that after an hour some folk songs were gathered.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer enjoyed.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to extend the opening term this time in his term plan.
He rejoices over the many assets with their positions, including mainly associations.
"In fact, it should not be given as much as a table," he thanked himself for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were at the stations and also the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town has a great boost - here's what's going on.
Then George Knorr and Gerd Klück were taken off with the help of the fire department and brought into the winter room.
In many places it has been worked for the permanent well.
From sweet to heart it was to have everything.
Stefan Hamgeyer, who has lived in Reckenfeld for the first time for a year, was created on his site of Decopier.
Furniture work, beer covered with motif fields and some more he had in his offer.
A specialty was built by three Reckenfelds Imker: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth Bus Schlüter.
Last name has another speciality.
Honigkuchen in glass, of course with Honig from my own production.
Since the little Elsa had to get back, the kitchen tasted so good.
The company is the one that left the visitors away for a long time until the evenings, even without a drill program that is not available at the harvest festival.
Smelling with local policy message: No successful advertising for Skate plant
In Luruch, unknowns have acquired almost beneficial ways and means of building a skeleton plant.
In several places, there are appropriate thresholds, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the UN.
In at least one case, the police have been punished for damages.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Lbaruch" appear on paintings, among other things at the Gempt Hall and the Old Rathaus.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the Hall, reports that after the election on 19 September a corresponding letter was found on the advertising child at the start of the trip to Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message was apparently "only" left with an Edding, they could have been removed without problems.
"A few days later, it was back there, this time it woke up," said Rottmann.
He says that the appropriate advertising must be replaced.
A special note is given in this case by the fact that several large companies from Lbarch are also mentioned on the table.
If the floor is built, their realization should also be enabled by sponsors.
In addition, Jörg Hesselmann is already informed by the city's professional field of school, sport and culture, without names.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical with those companies that are on the scale concerned.
For years local policies and administration have been dealing with the issue of Skate plant.
After the old LWL clinic was completed, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council spoke mostly for the fire station.
This opinion was not implemented - too many factors appear to be against building this place.
At the end of June, a turnaround followed.
The members of the Main Committee and the Finance Committee were now voting unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word then has the city tract.
He made a decision this year so that he could be built with a positive vote in 2019.
Adaptation to flight protection will become even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic show in the summer, the German airlines do not see any signs of improvement in the coming year.
"In this year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said the chief of the air navigation cooperation, Matthias Maas, of the German Press Agency before the air traffic jam on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flights is the well-known staff note in European aviation insurance, for which there is no rapid solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but training for new Lots takes four to five years," said the trader.
The European market for finished-trained Lots has been empty.
Only in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace was about a hundred people missing.
Maas once again criticised that various air transport companies were not invited to the summit.
In Hansestadt, representatives of the Federation, the countries, the airport, the airport and airport come together on Friday to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work coverage and overtime, it won't go without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members at the German-owned flight.
Maas once again made EU Commission's standards responsible for the Lotsen Missiles.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 were too low.
The costs and staff savings resulting from this are now fully covered by the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU), to apply in Brussels for regulations that "don't break the air further".
The EU's proposals would now be in line by 2024 and there would be further deterioration.
The EU was constantly subjected to lobby pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now taking into account exactly what they've done in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high cost of late flight costs would lead to a change of mind for airlines.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Protection (DFS) offers a "voting training and future package", Maas said.
The so-called catch of 120 seafarers over the next five years has just arrived to balance the old-age departures.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrup Supervisory Board approved for group building
The members of the Thyssenkrup Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plan to restructure the Group.
Following the will of Mr. Guido Kerkhoff, President of the Council at the Sunday meeting, the critical groups are to be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies should have their seat in the dining room and be noted at the bar.
An additional staff building should not be provided in addition to the already known cuts in the administration.
After two returns, the control grid on the capital page is only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are against it.
However, the final decision is expected to meet a major meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG should include, inter alia, the 50% share of the mergerd steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG is to combine the business with promotions and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence against Demos by police and Catholic independence defenders.
At the same time, two demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence defenders in Barcelona have resulted in violent side effects with numerous injuries.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6,000 independent protesters demonstrated.
The Catholic police have tried to keep both protests from one another.
According to the use force, however, independence defenders tried again and again to break the security barrier.
They had attacked the officers with color and bullets.
There was also information between the participants of the various protests.
According to the statement of rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police participated in six arrests.
Better custody and appreciation of colleagues
The police wanted to join the colleagues with their demonstration, who had taken their stand almost a year ago against the referendum on independence prohibited by the Spanish Central Government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they requested better containers.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel that it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they do.
The demonstrators received it as a provocation that the Spanish police calculated in Barcelona demonstrated.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan demonstrant Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they've disappointed us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic who wanted to name him only with Daniel showed back the draft.
"Of course we want to support our cameras, which have only done their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is to implement our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a great European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues were "not here to provoke," the policeman assured them.
Panne allowed access to personal data from the British Minister

Football: Juve Trainer dances for top party: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese Star Stürmer "has played the best game this evening with the half hour of Valencia", Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri praised after the 3rd (1:1) victory of the recordmaster against the SSC Neapel.
For the trainer, the expensive star was also bought without the man's own door in the important party against the persecutors.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and doing it well," said Allegri.
Even if we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first door - and we grew up from the moment.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three tortillas, Juve turned the game after the early retreat through the encounter of Tries Mertens (10 minutes) and was the first to fall back.
Torjäger, who was held by Real Madrid, first mentioned the former Bundesliga Prof. Mario Mandzukic, who provided a double package (26/49).
And Ronaldo also worked on an echo per headball for the meeting of Chief Leonardo Bonucci (76), who had just had to get in front of the tournament.
"There are many suggestions," praised the trainer.
Of course, Allegri also wants to see doors from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese National Mission of Record Protection.
"We have to be even better there to serve him," asked the coach.
The best juve protection is now Mandzukic with four encounters - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the power of young people seems to become even more oppressive.
Seven wins in seven games play the silent series in series A. At 21 points, the master of the remaining seven years has already had six numbers leading to Nepal.
The table width trained by former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti was not without chance against Turin.
But at least after the reference to the place of the already forgotten Mario Rui (58th), the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to take a hard step against Paul Dybala with yellow red from the spot.
"We have played well against a good nail," commented the Turinn Coach.
Emre Can also had a feeling of compromise.
The German national player has performed at Juve.
The profile from the FC Liverpool was used in all seven Liga parties.
The midfield editor also played in the Champions League Party against Valencia, which Allegri thought with the "half hour": Ronaldo was flying from the square at 2:0 at the top of the tournament and was stopped for the home game on Sunday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changed its name
With a particularly dark event, Rapper Kanye West provided a special attention on Saturday Night Live on the weekend at the US TV show.
Among other things, his common performance with Lil pump was ensured in a mineral water costume for iron rounds and frescoes in the audience.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change of name to publish his new album.
You can still call him "Ye," like the musician.
"The being known as Kanye West before," he tweeted in favour of the lost singer Prince, who composed his artists.
The pseudonym, however, is no novelty.
The 10th album already appeared under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "Yes" has a religious significance for him.
"I believe "Ye" is the most frequently used word in the Bible and there it means "du", as the rapper.
Football: Creisliga A1 Monster: End!
Oh, shit!
Hoetmars Trainer Averhage made no cure from his disappointment.
It was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was simply more aggressive, we put him as well as never before in the face of problems." The list of Hoetmar's options was read accordingly.
Grade two torcancs in 90 minutes so that only rare games can be made positive.
Football-Kreisliga A1: SC Howmar is located in SG Sendhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first pass, which first used Mike Krause from a sharp angle to early leadership (7).
In the 43th minute, Steppen would have been able to raise up Uphus, but after excellent preparation of Krause he became free.
The guests had only a double chance as Moritz Höne broke up with Torsteher Jos Schumacher and found his master in the next Jan Flower in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69).
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved his hand on the torline and saw it red - Niklas Eilmann could not use it for the guests (75).
As soon as Nils Berheide took the ball across the line, the party decided (81).
"We had criticized ourselves in the past, which was different today than in the last few weeks," said the fact of Florian Kraus.
Sender: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, May, Kraus, Krause (77th Century), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Edition), Turl.
Good: 0:1 Krause (7), 0:2 Truth (81).

Football: Creisliga A2 Monster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is located in Concordia with 3:4
"I don't even know what to keep," he said.
"We don't even have access to it." With which he must have meant the planes with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all other green whiskeys that fill with a collective offensive wave.
However, he could say, "A tricky victory," he still said, tired and went away from his players, but the relief was to note that they had taken three points out of the affair.
Well-marked, after a couple of two men, one of whom, namely Albachts, plays for the masterry and the other, Albersloh, fights for the classroom.
With understandable mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was our best seasonal performance with distance," he says.
"How we go back after 0:2, how we stand up all the time against one of the top men of the League, that was really phenomenal."
So the more it seems you have to go home now with empty hands.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner brought the host with his 12th season event (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this tower.
He placed the 2:0 on the left side with a pattern for Fabian Springing (39).
We knew it, but such a player can't be completely out of it.
"It was already a van, what he did," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent without hesitation.
Shortly before the page change, his own eleven created the equation: McGill's freestyle of left sails between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe in the long toreck (45).
After the page change, it was again McGill, who achieved the balance (59).
Then it went up and here.
It was a childish, action-loaded game.
Nübel threw the glasses again (64.), only five minutes later, Patrick Horstmann out (69.).
Despite the overpayment, Albersloh was no longer able to recover the last Concordia case (80).
We must now adjust our full concentration to Wednesday.
"The game against gossip, that's what we have to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spainberg - Hecker, Stromhbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diello), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Door: 1:0 Zümner (24.), 2:0 Spring (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jüll (80.).
Gelb-Rot: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg is fighting point against Primus
No winner has given it in the Landeslagi Dull between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.

Media: General Bureau of Dynamo Dresden
The entire presidency of the Dynamo Dresden football team is following media reports.
A number of media compete on the evening in harmony with a joint letter of the Gremium of Sachsen.
At first, there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal conflicts of power in the former Federal Lists.

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Popular Guests and New Offers
The evangelical Academy Tutzing offers some 80 meetings up to mid next year.
Because France's President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to buy himself a personal tolerance price in Tutzing.
For Christian Wolff, the time of office was too short: he was not in Tutzings evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wolff was there for a guest.
So he was told by the director of the Academy, Udo Hahn, when he proudly said: "All federal presidents and federal Chancellors were already with us." This continued to grow prominent at the Academy in the Tutzing Castle, but also during the presentation of the annual programme.
At a meeting on spiritual experience in philosophic perspective at the end of October, author Frido Mann was born on September 29 at a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Man.
In the meantime, President Emmanuel Macron of France has also said: He wants to take personally the "Tolerance Prize" awarded him by the Academy in Tutzing, which is also available in another category by TV Moderator Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings up to mid- 2019 are in progress.
"The interest rate is not safe at all!" is in a meeting title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - the Academy describes the "risk and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarie Without Border."
Weapons, destruction, torture, death - the war increases every human idea."
From structural racism in society about the gap between arms and wealth to radical changes in work through digitalization, the spectrum is sufficient.
Academic Director Hahn assured himself: "A free democracy needs places where a society can meet to seek solutions or at least for solutions."
At a meeting of 200.
The day of Karl Marx's birth is first expected by a more visitor to the direction of capitalism criticism, and others are more likely to tend to "from left to middle".
How does it look with neutrality?
"We are about 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Country Church," said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music board: Gender understanding with the heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische News
"Both for adults and for men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christian Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaretist, Teubner presented the gender understanding, not only with humor and warm hearts for the (sensitive) woman and (sensitive) men and what else it can do, but also with music.
The mini-gitarre put her in and mastered her violin.
On the flight to Ben Süverkrüp.
He is one of the men's saving partners who comes to the end of the sentence until the end of the sentence, to the other a true pianist: So royally comes in harmony with Süverkrp Teubner that some may wish to have a solo.
It was also with Beethoven and Chopin, but otherwise, as it was for the red faden of the evening.
There Teubner had brought a paradoxon into play: The satisfaction of a man comes when he has a partner, but he didn't open this door.
However, a closed door without a partner does not bring any benefits.
The piano solo now demonstrates itself: What would emerge from the composition of Mozarts, "the Nannerl" had suddenly opened the door?
This leads to overcrowding in improvisations, from Bachs "O main full of blood and wounds" into the "Lide of Death" and from Mozart g-Moll-Symphony into a played dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
Flowers reached Karlheinz Kleintje, director of the company, chancellor.
However, President Heidemarie Markenbeck was not able to express any additional thanks.
She had the idea of sending Duo in addition to the events in Stuttgart and Frankfurt to another in Wolbeck.

Handball: Women-Landesliga: Ahlener SG holds against TV Waterscheid almost the white West
Problems were mainly with third-party player Carolin Stallmann, who had only ten hits.
"In fact, I was well satisfied with the turn, only one player has made too many doors.
We haven't got them in the grip," says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more proud of the many opportunities he had left.
The concentration at the end left his men missing this time.
Therefore, the ASG ran almost to the end of a retreat, lay behind the break at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45).
First against the end, the wider bank of the guests became crucial.
In addition, Aydogdu returned Merle Clement placed on the left side, which then made "extreme clever the decisive towers" (Aydogdu).

At 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the prime minister of the year.
Food has been adopted in the second row, but it has not come into play.

In the second sentence, the BSV already led by 12:8. "The adoption of the three-year rule has been implemented.
We couldn't stop the pressure.

International: Turkish Communities: Moscow opening as a lost opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way and manner in which the large diaspora mosque was established in Cologne by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a screen gate in the German-Turkey relationship that can only be carefully reassembled," said TGD President Kökay Sofuoglu, the German editing network.
Both the Turkish and the German side had missed the opportunity of a joint, shameful event.
"To stress the presence of the Muslim to Germany by German top politicians, Erdogan has used the term for his purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The extensive exclusion of the German public has "increased many reservations".
Home note: Offer has already been established
After the long summer break, it's finally time to meet again.
On 18 October (Donesday) at 19:30 p.m., the hometimer Nottuln has already held its fifth Nottulner folk meeting in the old office room.
Exactly on the day it is then a year ago that we first had a folk meeting.
In the meantime, this event has become a strong part of the musical event calendar in Nottullen," Hans Moormann, president of the Nottulner House, rejoices.
I didn't think that our folk meeting was going so fast in nottullen.
Whether Stormtif Friederike in January or Hitzwelle in July, the office room was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next folk meeting is like always a combination of German folk leaders, wanderers and seamen, folkongs, evergreens and old hunters," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who has always invited once again friends to Nottullen.
For the first folk "Birth" day, Klaus Playmeyer spoke with his accordion.
He was a member of Gaitling for many years, a group from nearby Steinfurt, who played music with platinum German texts.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
Thank you for remembering the people's last event in the summer when Christoph Schulz of Emsdettet’s folk meeting with his international composition of the song "Further in the night" excited the audience and sent an earring home.
"We count with many happy guests to spend a quiet and humorous night again," it says in the invitation to the home convention.

Since the desired seats are always fast, it is recommended to be there for a while.
The public meeting starts at 19.30 p.m., but admission is already at 19 p.m.

From pure fruit production to green
With a gala in the Dr. Stamberger Hall, the 125-year-old circle association for gardening and land care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, the last foundation impulse for the circuit assembly for garden construction and land care of Kulmbach was set up with an overview of the Kulmbach United Kingdom, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a large anniversary in the Kulmbach City Hall on Saturday evening.
He was free to do something else: as "Birgreeksbombeverein Kulmbach City and Land" he was expelled from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa 1893.
The purpose of the fruit plant was also different from that of today's work - it was actually clean about the fruit tree, about flowers and gardening that day no one thought about it.
"At that time, at the time of the revelation, the fruit tree was a beloved son of the elite," Kreishiimattpführer Günter Dippold said in his festival speech.
Fruit trees should be planted by street roads, so-called industrial measures were introduced in schools.
The building is still the task of 55 garden construction companies in the Kulmbach countryside, which includes nearly 7,000 members.
However, the spectrum is far from being created.
A natural gardening, biological plant protection, village beauty and food play a similar role as the means of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
As the task areas of a garden construction company have varied, members of the Hutschdorfer youth group "Maulwurfe" have shown their support on the stage.
"The work of youth is particularly urgent in the digital age," said the vice-president Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed the importance of experience in nature for life.
The Castian collection was a huge challenge for us children, I doubt that you can gather much joy with smartphone & Co., as well.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Søllner for the Jubilee.
"Where are they going to stand, the circle link decides," Landrat Søllner added, adding the special importance of garden construction companies for the villages.
The circle bond is for the ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real settlement of many garden construction companies in the countryside also left no doubt as to the role of circuit business leaders and experts Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with an image presentation through the long history of the circle bond and reported, inter alia, the need for self-supply after the war.
Earlier everything came out of the garden, it was enough for the winter.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the use gardens have turned into a garden of interest.
"The nature has a record, she was already there before us and we need to focus on it," complained the specialist for fruit and nut trees.
That is why it gives the garden construction companies the opportunity not to give up their sports so that our home remains beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming new citizens in our associations, complemented by the President of the Bavarian Country Federation, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the ecclutant return to insects, which we are responsible for our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful festival, which was celebrated by the turbulence of the Thurnau Music Association.

Priority to Nafta Talks: Canadian Foreign Minister leaves UN-Red
Mexico government wants clarity in matters of oil: they make two trading partners an ultimate agreement.
The Canadian Foreign Minister is now giving the trade agreement an absolute priority - and he is forwarding his talks to the United Nations.
Due to the pressure of the ring on a new flag of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has moved her talks at the UN General Debate in New York.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in an attack, left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lived after a report of the "O Globo" newspaper.
After its adoption, it is still unclear whether the 63 years will take place in the last week before the presidential elections in the South American country.
The politician was attacked in early September during an election campaign in South Brazil on an open road.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people went on the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele nou" (in German: "The not"), women had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, the alliances against Bolsonaros also made racist and feminine statements mobile.
Thousands of demonstrators were expected in the São Paulo economic metropolis.
In the capital city of Brazil, the protests met with a customer presentation of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the position of former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years of corruption and therefore could not apply.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As former Mayor of the Millionenstadt São Paulo, Haddad was questioned for a long time after the right-wing candidate Bolsonaro.
Although the "Turp Brasiliens" has been involved in politics for a long time, it presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there is a vote on 28 October.
Observers point out that Bolsonaro will not succeed - no matter who he is.
Bolsonaro is known for his admiration for homosexuals and blacks and for his military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He's always shocked again with verbal solutions.
On another occasion he said that Lulas' attachment to the left party should be shot.

He sold about three million plates in Denmark.
Its album "Midt About Night" from 1983 is still the most sold album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday as a "strengthening" statement, which "was against everything but in all hearts".
The Head of Government recalled that the Monarchie-Gegner Larsen was represented on the 70th day of the birth of the Danish King Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: Sound strength at pressure air-thummer level
"Here we stand, take the bones and sing a concert tab with the power of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" put a description of the rock life experience on Saturday evening at the Hall of the City Centre Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pure by three and a half other bands friends.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert starts, the musician even takes time for a group photo.
There's no trace from the lamp fiber.
Next, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the environment - all in connection with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Old - with their bands loud enough to see about 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
The "Tiger Bonesaw" quartet with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika is already aware of the role of the concert day with the latest, unknown items from their own feds and the first CD to appear.
At the stage, the band's vocal and printed composition will be danced.
Although "Zugab" calls are not to be stopped, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Mr. We Stand".
The hardrock is not the same as Hardrock, showing guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierenrich at the bass and knifer Kai Hölscher with their alternatives to the classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" comes at "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock, a synthesizer for use.
Not only is the visible, just to be balladed "Take Me Home" is the result of the exchange of melodic passages into the guitarless rockifs of the multilayered songs.
The Quartet "The Ignition" from Tonneshäuchen has since its establishment in 2005.
Full agitity the band presents its hardlock on Saturday.
The "The Ignition" with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - has a special stage experience, is obvious and unsurpassed.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets in conjunction with the band at the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s, all its own accents.
At the same time, guitarrist Norbert Brinkmann delivers even higher-powered sound than before, while he runs through the public.
A certain sound strength is essential for such a hardrock concert of course: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, the sound of the mixful ball team is at the three-track concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" at about 98 decibels.
This is about the level of pressure airtimer, but it is still very clear under the influence of the "Watching Festival" on the "The Ignition" on its website.
An earful of 120 decibels in düsentrieble strength, as in the annual metal stand in the north of the Republic, does not require the public at this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the toughest rock gang have long convinced their sovereign, virtual game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, we have taken the bone marrows and healed a concert week with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say, freely in the transferable sense, at the end.
And especially enjoy the great appeal of visitors.

A dead at a sailplane crash at the airport Eaten/Mülheim
At Mülheim/Essen Airport it became a fatal accident.
On a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport, a sailor is interrupted on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
In the vicinity of Mülheim/Essen Airport, a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As the "West Deutsche General Journal" reported, a sailplane was crashed at the airport at the fair park.
The pilot had come to life.
As the "WAZ" further reports, if the pilot was on board alone - it should be an initiator.
The aircraft has already been on land flight by accident.
The airport is located just outside of a fixed station on the airport.
But since this weekend, there's been an October party.
The Mülheim/Essen airport is located on the city border of the two railway areas and directly on the road to the highway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park&Ride offer at large events in the fair of Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump says to Kim: "And then we fell in love with him."
That the US President North Korea Machthaber Kim, despite the nuclear crisis, is well-known, is not a secret.
Now Trump has made a regular statement of love to his colleague.
It's also got to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the age of 72, the married president of the United States has become known as a new flame.
Tragic: It's a remote relationship.
In all the public, Donald Trump made a special statement of love on Saturday to North Korean Machthaber Kim Jong.
In the United States of America West Virginia, Trump found almost intimate words for the half-year-old spruce of the Herrscher Dynasty from Pjøng, although it appears in the ring of North Korea's nuclear disarmament as a right-wing bridge.
"I was quick, he too, and between us it went up here," reported Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not just the conversation with Kim had brought his heart to the shame.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Your personal connection has also brought political results: Trump refers to the stop of all atomic and rocket tests announced by Kim, even if critics see so far less than lip recognition.
That it should not be for everyone to be aware of the fact that "Rocket Man" - so Trump's name for Kim - should not be for any memory, seems to the US President.
In any case, he took the unexpected criticism of his appearance in a large sports hall in Wheeling City: "Donald Trump says they've fallen in love."
How horrible, how horrible is that?
That's so unpresidial.
But he was worried about it very little, said a trumpet and pointed his finger at people like this: "I've always told you it's so easy to be presidial."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there in this jungle, but we'd only be 200 people out there.
October party attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler's best to visit, vote-ful and above-run sun set: very varied and with a good shot Octobererfestflier, Baesweilers has emerged in the inner town on Sunday.

Refugees thanks to video from Libyan prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed to their catastrophic sea conditions in Libya with the help of a phone video and thus enable their rescue.
The group had run the recording in its cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July under a life-threatening threat and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video.
We're suffering here. We're dying here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally evacuated to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we might not have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had taken the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to reach the Mediterranean.
With the video, he took his own statement to the risk of life.
One of his rivals had been executed by the guards almost to death, Onyeka said.
In general, the sea conditions have been catastrophic: "They all beat us with rats and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat. We had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees who are displaced in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year with the help of the program, said IOM speaker in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians who are now rescued is not unusual in view of the bad conditions in Libya.
He hasn't heard from a help show by phone video.
International organizations have been critical of the situation in the Libyan refugee camps for a long time as human beings.
The North African state, which is largely controlled by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the road from Africa to Europe.

At 16:50 p.m. the teacher gives the building over the main entrance.
In the front yard of the first store, she saw a man running right away.

Deutscher was arrested in his own car a long time ago
A 75-year-old has had to spend several days and nights in his car in a forest area in the middle of the forest, after he had fixed the car along all the way to the forest and blocked a tree.
Rescue forces discovered the Pkw on Saturday at random near a distance and released the missing since the service day, and the police shared with the police on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld is then given despite the cold nights and the long absence of care in good health.
He started to enjoy his home now.
The Rentner was reported missing from his family after he had not returned to the local visas and fields on the day of duty from a train with his land vehicle.
Despite intense research measures, the man's stay remained unclear for a long time.
Laschet has legal rights in Turkey
Köln NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has adopted law in Turkey in his own statement to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overestimated", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Kolner Airport.
This is particularly true of prisons, the press and freedom of religion.
He therefore "introduced that, if relations should be normalised in the future, economic relations should be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important condition".
Laschet also spoke according to his own information about the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He has expressed the expectation that freedom of opinion will be observed.
Erdogan once again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The talk by Laschet and Erdogan was briefed in a building of the Federal Defence Ministry at Kolner Airport.
It was originally supposed to happen on the castle wall - but it was rejected by the lockers from political conviction against Earthgan.
Erdogan continued after the conversation to open the diitib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had rejected a joint event in the construction.
But he said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact partners - not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the United States: North Korea puts claim for disarmament
While U.S. President Trump will not hesitate to stress the success of the negotiations on the nuclearization of North Korea, the ostastic regime represents the relationship between them.
Foreign Minister Ri asks for a Washington convention.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has called on the US Government to block negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its continuing sanctions.
"The most recent silence is that the United States is building on forced measures that are deadly for trust training," Ri said in New York.
A suspension is unforgettable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any trust in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way that we will be armed as the first one ourselves," said the North Korean Chief Diplomat.
The criminal action in North Korea could "force knowledge" be "a desire of people who don't know us".
In order to build confidence, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and rocket tests and destroyed an atomic plant.
On the US side, however, it has not given "responsive reactions", the Minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and rocket programme, the UN Security Council had decided three times a year to impose sanctions on the internationally isolated country.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo in the past few days at the United Nations have been committed to strict compliance with criminal measures.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on an approach.
In June Trump first met North Korea Machthaber Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the President of the United States wants a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will again talk about the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons programme to Pjøngjang.
Hot service: New kitchen with expenses from the municipality
Because they were actually in a youth meeting, many visitors from the house of the open door Hot got nothing with: white blankets and flower beauty on the table and a large buffet waiting for the guests after the Ertendunk Goddess service.
The young people of the Hot had the buffet with tastes from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by expenditure from the Community for which the young people wanted to thank for the food.
The start with the new facility was not just as Henryte Westbuer, the leader of the Hot, remembered.
We had already filled our refrigerators before the summer break with food and food and were best prepared on the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break, the bad surprise came: A storm had set the huge, double refrigerator out of operation, the food had been polluted and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again: although we have received very much support from friends and neighbors, the children and young people wanted to create it alone," says Westbury.
And then everybody packed it up.
The result could be seen as the guests were excited.
"It can't be better to cook," a visitor was impressed by the fact that while Hokkaido beer soup was served or the guests were supposed to be served at Quiche, Liverpool or Kitchen.
"It's really great what the children and young people put on their feet," stressed Father Frank Beckmann, while Zauberer Stephan Lammen with cardboard prints and other works of art.
Jürgen Sator leaves the country president NRW of the table
Out of frustration over criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essener Table, Jörg Sartor, delivered his posts in the country's association.
Sartor was widely known because the Essene table had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He was already back as vice-president of NRW tables in July, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
There's too many of us in the back.
The head of the NRW Tablen Country Federation, Wolfgang Weilerswist, issued an understanding against the dpa decision of his long-term representative.
The sharp criticism has taken Sartor.
"I can follow his steps - there have been people who didn't even know why the dining table did it."
But Sartor is still active for the dining table - "six days a week since nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
Sartor again criticized colleagues from other tables in the "World on Sunday".
You should not follow the approach, "without us the people in the city are starving."
It is the duty of the State to ensure that people are not starving.
At a convention of the tables on Friday in Berlin, the Essener did not attend.
"That's going to tell me too much sweet noise," he said.
There are all these social fuzzies that have criticized me so much at the time.

For Wolfsburg's comparison to 1:1 Renato Steffen was responsible for his second Federal Liator.

Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia today, about 1.8 million citizens agree on whether the name of their country should be changed in Northern Macedonia.
In one case, nearly three decades of ongoing conflict with the neighboring Greece could be resolved.
Athens had a name change due to its same-named northern province and had blocked any approach to the west of Macedonia.
The voters therefore also decide on future West integration.
The United States had announced that the country could become a NATO member at a positive end of the referendum.

SPD Politicians: Johannes Kahrs married his friend
Almost a year after the wedding, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two gave the jacket.
An integrated life partnership had not come into question for her, Kahrs had said before the "image" show.
"If we were married, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahr is a budgetary political speaker of the SPD Bundestag Group and one of the spokesmen of the Marine Circle, the conservative SPD wing.
In the federal debate on the opening of the wedding for homosexuals, Kahrs had taken a step forward on 30 June 2017.
So he had called for the German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to have "lost" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in response to the urgent announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had been able to enter into their life partnership since 2001, but there was no comparison between marriage and adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters cut heck
There was an entire amount of work for the members of the Association of Citizens of Children's House and the Society for Lepracunde.
Because about 400 meters of hecke around the gardens of the inhabitants of the foster home should be cut off.
With the support of the inhabitants, about twelve volunteers went to work.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," said the president of the Civil Union, Walter Schröer.
And so did some of them.
Because of the hot summer we are late this time, but luckily it's just a piece.
Because in the spring you've already cut the heck once.
The next morning at work also has a long tradition.
"It should all remain with forces," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner holds gold at the Canuslalom-WM
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the conclusion of the Canuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old took a perfect walk on the Olympic road on Sunday.
Two years ago he had spent three hundred seconds of his Olympic Bronze.
I was well prepared, there were already enough roads here on the farm and it's been all right today," said the Olympics in London 2012.
To this end he turned his back before joy and drove both arms safely to the height - well aware that it would be at least enough for a medal.
Everhin had a start number four.
However, the six remaining starters were unable to increase their time of labor of 89.69 seconds.
The second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec before the Russian Pavel Eigel.
The police inspection Gauting reports the first attempt to use this herbtest in a single-family home.
Fortunately, the aunts broke up.
The days will be shorter - this is what the breakers want to use again.
That's how the police inspection Gauting reported yesterday the first attempt to use this herbtest.
The fact that it remained at the home of the family on the royal road is to be appreciated by the alarm facility.
It went out when the aunt put her hand on Friday at about 20 o'clock.
The intruders knew that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, was surprised by the apparent extent that they were able to catch the flight without fear.

Pleite at Hertha: From the reality: Bayern against Ajax required
This is why it is inevitable that the download in Berlin will "not fall" by the FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate phase for the time of Niko Kovac's office.
The first small parts of the new coach Niko Kovac are not to increase for the monks to the largest grass depth.
"A week ago you had the impression that we were invisible.
Now we've got a little reality," Thomas Müller noted after the winning 0:2 discount at Hertha BSC and asked for a response to the Championship League Dull with Ajax Amsterdam.
Who knows us who knows that we deserve it and that is why we give gas on Tuesday.
For the first time since more than a year, no own tower has been shot, as at the same time in the preseason, two compulsory games in series without winning the table leadership in the football Bundeslaga first lost to Borisia Dortmund.
The overall situation is not as dramatic as the end phase of the divorced Carlo Ancelotti End of September 2017, but the record teacher must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its funning man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful naddles across the outside have delivered two rounds within three days, like the last superpowered Bayerns are still to knock.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we don't let this happen to us and we'll do everything we can to be successful again," Kovac stressed.
On the other hand, with his losses in his hometown, however, he went surprisingly healthy and created his first landing as Münchner Coach only on the reopened treatment of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Bourussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would make the first phase of his official period more positive - otherwise, the tone would have to change.
So Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second King-class appearance of this season after 2:0 in Benfia Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation begins on the second round game against Ajax, which also forced AEK Athens to rule by 3.0.
"Now we've learned in two games, but we're also going to make our doors again," declared National Manning Captain Manuel Newer.
As already after the lost pocalfinale against Frankfurt entry in the same place, Joshua Kimmich Ssext spoke in particular.
The lawyer acts as a hero in the role of the lawyer.
"I don't think it's all peach, we have to redesign it as well because we don't make the number of opportunities and make the mistake back," stressed the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous game, the Bayern even placed five numbers behind Dortmund, which now took over the tops with a point of origin.
And so believed Kimmich with at least a positive look, that now the public debate on the relatively unwarranted Bayern has come to an end.
"Yes, that's a good time," said the national player.
It's good for the League.
DFB-Boss in Schusslinie: Özil-Cauusa: Scharfe Attacks by Erdogan and Grindel
The Turkish President Erdogan, with severe prejudices, is preparing an exception between Mesut Özil and Ilkaya Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees a mistake, but defends the link line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought at different levels about the Germans' integrity in the long-term issue Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticised the relationship with the former world master in Germany, the DFB chief defended the link line.
Early Sunday morning, Grindel, who had personally been attacked by Özil, announced the consequences of the cause in Mainzer ZDF "Sportstudio".
"That is what we need in the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-manuies - very precisely the conclusions that this is not going to happen again," said 57-year-olds and wants to win a national player without a migration background as further integration mandate.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan is not for the values of the football and the DFB.
With sharp words, this had aroused racism against Ozil and Ilkaya Gündogan.
We were born in Germany and raised in Mesut Ozil and our Ilkaya.
They have excluded them from this society because they took pictures with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the city of Domstadt.
I could not honestly say as your President, that our two young men, who have been raised to the German National Mission, have been confined.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that this felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" in contrast with Özil after the WM business that had taken place by photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to appear before players in the future.
That's what someone says: If I win, I'm German if I lose, I'm migrant - that's not going.
"That he has such an impression, I'm very sorry," said Grindel.
We had to defend Mesut more than I've ever said.
However, he does not see a basis for a return to the national team.
As a result, an additional integration officer will be appointed in addition to the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon.
"If a non-migrating background is clearly affecting society and football and says, "The issue is important, we need to take care of it," it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our societies in front of the place where integration needs to work," Greenel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the WM-out and the Ösil-Avry, he wants to apply again for the office as President of the DFB next year.
"I'm doing my job and I'm trying to make them as good as it is," Greendel said.
Last year three accidents occur within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As the police reported, 75-year-olds caused accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 13 p.m.
At first the 75-year-old driver of a lady was interviewed at the red ampel in the area of Louter's height.
This guy shared with the Renter that he would risk his car.
But it didn't come to a personal exchange because the 75-year-old lady couldn't find her in the parking lot anymore.
A short time later, the police received a phone call from a car driver who would come out of the street and run against a guide.
In response, the man did not want police in front of the area and was subsequently threatened.
Then the redsmith went home.
However, the renter has been working in his residence where he has lived for decades and has closed a vehicle on the way back.
Finally, the police could find him and arrest him.
His car showed significant accidents.
The 75-year-old made a real impression and couldn't feel much more.
The damage is approximately EUR 1300.
Moorfire in Meppen: Still almost 1000 use forces in use.
About four weeks after the construction of the Moorbrand on a federal railway station in Emsland, 980 use forces are still engaged in the demolition.
That was shared by the Federal Navy on Sunday.
As the position of a speaker continued to be stable, 70 honourable assistants were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction of the number of use forces has been planned, that is.
On the night of Sunday, an overarching fire was discovered and destroyed.
Last week the disaster was lifted, which was called a good week before 21 September, because it was feared that the flames would put forests and settlements at risk by wind and funnel flight.
On Thursday, then, it was no longer necessary for a transfer of the fire to the adjacent communities.
In time, more than 1500 use forces tried to get the Great Fire under control.
The aircraft continues to support the work on the Federal Coastal Test Area in Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also clearance flights with German sailboats.
For 2 and 5 October, further clarification flights with "Tornados" were planned.
The fire was fired by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke phase of the Moorbrandt was temporarily up to a hundred kilometers across the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up an interview to prevent reports of damage.
First claims for damage were already announced by hotel owners and holiday owners.
SPD Politicians: Johannes Kahrs married his friend

Hamburg - Almost a year after the marriage began, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two gave the jacket.

He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahr is a budgetary political speaker of the SPD Bundestag Group and one of the spokesmen of the Marine Circle, the conservative SPD wing.
In the federal debate on the opening of the wedding for homosexuals, Kahrs had taken a step forward on 30 June 2017.
So he had called for the German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to have "lost" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in response to the urgent announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had been able to enter into their life partnership since 2001, but there was no comparison between marriage and adoption law.

Switzerland starts an electronic register for organ donors
The registry should facilitate organ donation and release its members in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs must continue to be excluded only with express consent, stressing Swiss transplantation.
(dpa) Switzerland will start an electronic register for organ donors this month.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve members of stressful situations.
People who want to make their bodies available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes are then available in case of need of Swiss transplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs are still - as in Germany - only with express consent - emphasised Swiss transplant.
It appears that 15 percent of Switzerland has a way of spending, says Franz Ever, director of the Swiss transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases will find a card at the crucial moment in the case of potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of the talks, members do not know the wish of the deceased.
"Then they have to decide for themselves what is often very taxable in the sense of the deceased," he said.
A similar registration system already exists in Britain.
In Germany there are considerations to store data on possible organ donation on the health card, as the Federal Centre for Health Statement speaker Marita Völker-Albert says.
"A registry that allows people to access their wishes - pro or against organ donation - does not exist," she says.
Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn spoke for a reorganisation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered an organ donor, whether he or his or her members object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church teaches that.

Knicks connects as corridors located within a dedicated living room that can still function on the exchange of organisms, as the business leader of the Nature Protection Union of Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living zones
The knicks were held on the basis of an order of the Danish King Christ VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living zones" were not only field and livestock, they also provided the farmers with wood and bars for their professional homes.
From that time on, his name is also "Knick": Through "mucking" of the bones, the thick, flimsy boundaries developed.
Today, between the North and the East Sea about 45,000 kilometers of the hecks and they offer the image of a fertile, multi-structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are currently used by some 7,000 species of animals as living space.
In a kilometer knife, up to 1800 different species could live and live up to 30 bird pairs.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled when it is properly served in winter.
Otherwise, he is concerned about a light range of trees that also has the effect of wind protection in addition to the species variety, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the supply of land may only be operated from October to March, as indicated by the Ministry of Agriculture.

The local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami:
Were you on the Tsunamis yourself?
No, I was at the time in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquake occurred, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
Then, when I learned from Tsunami, I immediately made myself on my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport was closed at Palu at the time.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be applied.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that are all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also submerged other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many are scattered on surrounding hills, where they are still afraid of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stand up in front of their homes, there are still after-beams.
Because many food business and even the tanks are completely closed, people partook of food and gasoline.
The public service is completely under way which the national government is helping.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners run part free here and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies here, many people have not been found and are missing.
How does communication and information supply run on the island?
At the moment, we have managed, however, it has not worked before and we have only received information about the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people who do not know whether they live and where they stand because people were not at home during the earthquake, but for example at work.
The Tsunami warning system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons for it, but when the warning came, many thought "okay, no Tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not affected by Tsunami, there was a lack of information that a Tsunami meets in the region and they are scattered on the surrounding mountains.
Isn't an island like Sulawesi, which is located on the Pacific Firering, prepared on earth?
But there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure is broken together, the earthquake has hit very many people.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI research in Turbotime
The time is extremely short and the number of planned acquisitions is very limited.
With a FBI study in Turbotemppo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to ensure the high majority of law-enforcement candidates from Brett Kavanaugh, who are challenged by demand.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for investigators to Friday to clarify the must-be events of more than 30 years.
The most recent developments in the drama about the Kavanaughs occupation accompanied by a cultural struggle were released on Friday.
Following an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the lawyer was opposed to the opposition Democrats, the Justice Committee of the Senate should open the way for the final confirmation of the conservative judge at the Supreme Court of the United States.
The majority of the Republicans seemed to be certain that when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared against his original announcement, he would agree, but requested an FBI investigation.
After the mood-like scenes, his party friends wanted to join him.
President Trump, who had described the difficult conditions on Thursday as "best", initially included further attacks on women and spoke against "poverty in happiness".
In this way, the last doubts could be raised, he said.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats at a election contest because they refused Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy them."
Trump ordered FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case

FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: Man has scared the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season against Mainz.
The relief on board is great after the first season.
However, the factor time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - Middleway is known for its long history that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football games.
That was no different in the game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were many acres and many villages in our resort," said the sports president of Schalke 04 - and remarked.
Finally, it was possible for the king's blues to bring the first season into the roof and profession.
It could actually have been different.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of Chief Trainer Domenico Tedesco had given him security: "In summally, the first half time was good, both playful and from the Pressing here."
Really don't create headball puzzle
"The last ten minutes have made me feel like two hours," he said, "If the man was just half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand."
The boys were afraid to get it out of their hands and so they kept coming back.
And he defends himself against Man and Mouse.
To save the first three figures of the season.
"We all have fallen a huge stone from the heart," said the Creator, who had nothing to do with his headball attack: "I am actually the worst headball player in man's life."
But in the end, it's only the victory.
The relief was all over the arena, of course, also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start printing in the initial phase and do a firework," said Schalkes Chefcoach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the crew and the fans.
We've played smart, quiet and bravely, so we need to go to parties over 90 minutes.
This is probably the biggest manko of the afternoon: King's blue missed it, more for clearer relationships to worry.
The possibilities for this were finally there, about through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, which twice met the latte 59/72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have become a nightmare," said Tedesco, "but the fear has gone a little further."
That's why I'm glad we won.
That's why he wasn't the only switcher.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on eye height
The author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani, stands before them.
He followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Housechild.
"I've been tasking myself for many years to get interested people to Greven," explained the founder and president of the "Reckenfelder Meeting" - the association that co-operated in the evening orientation with the "Cultural Policy" association.
El-Mafaalani is very interested in reading, describes the writing process of the book, discusses how difficult it was to explain the subject clearly.
With many gestures, fixed numbers and one or more whites, he brings the audience one of the most controversial topics: migration and integration.
Why are more and more conflicts created despite effective integration?
The Syrian-speaking author is responsible for answering the question of a metaphor.
On a table, the German society, on the catechtically, sits the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they are still on the big table and want to be united.
This leads to conflicts.
That is why it is important not whether one is on the right or on the left, but, "Am I for or against an open society?" he stressed.
At the beginning of the debate, then the debate is always under way.
And there's a need to talk.
A Afghan refugee reports from its perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unskilled integration in students.
El-Mafaalani stands, not at the stage, a sign for the discussion: It is on the surface.
The sociology professor does not insist on his opinion, stressing that he speaks of the average, not of individual cycles.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject because "first, if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Also during the next signing hour, he had an open hour for the questions of the guests and also in Foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, intensively further discussion.

As far as Schalke Naldo's "great sport" is on the bank
For the third time, Naldo is not in the starter: However, Naldo is grateful for Schalke Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time, not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bank, the understanding of many people would have been great if the nearly two meters large Brazilians had spoken so correctly about the fruit of the soul.
But when the chess player gathered after the 1:0-winning on the FSV Mainz 05 as usual in the middle circle and thanked Chief Trainer Domenico Tedesco for all his careers, the 36-year-old, who called all the simple-minded Naldo, one and said, "We have to thank you, coach!"
"That was very emotional, it was a great sport," said Tedesco later on about the reaction of his vice-presidents, who, despite his recent reservations design, didn't hit any holes.
It is likely that Naldo, who was celebrated as the best sculptor in the past season, knows that he has not actually been hit at the same time by his trainer - but for good reason he gets a break.
A reason called "tax control".
It wasn't easy to tell him that.
"It wasn't easy for him to tell you what I'm telling you honestly," said Tedesco from the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the starter.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the unity," Germano reasoned the step.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that you can all get through this time.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco declared the rotation, which has recently discovered Naldo.
And the Brazilians responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: he also showed himself to the bank as a model model.
