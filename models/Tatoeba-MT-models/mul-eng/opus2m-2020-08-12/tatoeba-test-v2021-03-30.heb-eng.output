You need to wake up, Tom.
So you're not happy to see me?
You guys don't have a cat.
What can that do?
If you turn right, you'll stand in front of the city's house.
Tom's supposed to be okay by the second day.
Give me what you got.
Time for Tom.
It's one of my concerns.

Do you want to hear more?
I can rest.
These break the rules will work.
I don't even care about it.
All of this was about to happen.
I'm sure your intentions are clear.
She's exactly like her mother.
He's always taking care of a ghost.
Sometimes he's an interesting guy.
Where do you see him?
Get me in.

Tom's in good shape.
I don't understand that.
It's too cold for me.
Tom's the only one who knows for sure.

I'm drinking wine.
Tom's wearing his coat and coming out.
What do you mean?
I'm doing you a favor.
A 90-foot wall turned straight.
Can you stand up until the next stop to rest?
Why don't you just let me talk?
The cop's just in the parking lot for the car you're stopping.

Don't believe in Tom.
We'll meet you down there.
I'm trying to help you now.
Maybe you're suffering from brain damage.
It's a big drive to this car.
I was drunk.

You're a liar.
It's morning.
It's just running on windows.
Stay right here.
I don't have time for guests today.

Has he got hurt in the ass?
Just forget about it.
Do you have tens of thousands in your pockets?
Mario's coming back to light.
Here's my friend's card.
The door is locked.
I'll deal with it as a duty answer.
Don't thank me, thank Tom!
I'm a fan.
Tell him it's the first priority.
Don't be so tired!
You must remain responsible.
Tell the truth and Satan.
I'm sorry about later.
Wake up, you're half an old man.
We don't mean to do that.

I really need your help.
He's a handsome guy who's looking at everyone high.
If I know what she loves, it's because of you.
It's coming to me.
Now you see my point?
That'll be enough.
Don't tell me what to do!
I don't have a card.
Let me tell you why Tom doesn't feel good about me.
I'm not doing this.
The dollar price started down.
We've got some legal problems we need to figure out.
Damn it in Tom's car.
The breed of animals in our city is big and new.
The driver's turn right.
I understand why.
Do we have a chance to say no to the United States?
Nimosio isn't Nimossy Jentelman.
Take care of it for me, okay?
Where's your family?
It's so hard.
Go over there now.
I went twice.
The city is divided into two parts.
The rich people are different from you and me.
We want it together.
Helen returned today's events.
Did you hit the trigger?
My shoes didn't come.
Tom, move your arm!
A man's got a lot of money.
Old TV is sold for $10.
He's better than me in any heat.
You're not fast, are you?
She left him some food.
We have to use all the means to convince him.
Tom can't bear it anymore.
No one's gonna shoot me.
You can trust her.
Is that your password?
After the seabed, we stopped.
I'm surprised it doesn't exist at all.
I've got a warrant to check this out.
I want to drink mineral water.

Now present yourself using these laws.
This car has enough power to climb the mountain easily.

Oh, my God, I'm so fat.
Anyway, it's not good for me.
I'm learning Russian.
We're going to forget this fact.
It's just red.
Tom's got a lot more sleep than he's planning.
He's been working on some soap.
I'm adding justice.
Go on, please.
The Janets Hobbso yesterday.
Tom tried to let the girls go.
I don't see why these are news.
A lot of things got Tom busy.
Tell me if I need to make some changes.
Surprisingly, all the lights went out.
The walls of her room were covered in crosses.
Can I get you a paper card, please?
Your Honor, please fill in the cup.
I fell to the ground and fell to the ground.
Tom has a glass of vodka.
You look great.
Things change.

Do you really care?
This store's got almost everything we need.
She hasn't been on her phone yet.
You can find yourself in a mental danger.
The first day is my toughest day.
We believe in Baal.
Get out of here, Tom.
How many barberrys!
That statement doesn't break the source.
They'll be teachers.
She's on the table.
I think he's right.
I'd rather be separated.
I can't live without you.
Make it happen.
Tom has money, but he's not so happy.
Wait a minute, okay?
Jim's not a lawyer, but a doctor.
When did you get back from his tattoo?
Why do you say it works?
You'll be healthy in a few days.
Who's this girl?
He married when he was in Germany?
I thought Tom was in danger.
You have to think about yourself.
Are we left with sugar?
They're eating a tree flower.
Can you still remember the first time we met?
We'll do it.
Students, by means of temporary work, are able to pass on the student's salary to themselves.

Tom's pretty tired.
Don't be silly about it.
Tom tells me you're smart.
Here it is.
Leave it behind.
I had a cup of tea with Tom the same day.
Who's Tom talking to?
He's gone by the house.
The question is, there's only one difference.
I got out of my mind.
Honesty doesn't always pay back, so it's the way of the world.
I want to know who's coming with us.
With the Klingon, they're the hero of a civil war program.
Tom needs to mean it.
Tom objected to being treated like a child.
The manager's dealing with a lot of problems.
Children need a happy home.
You know what, Tom, you're right.
How does it belong to you?
September is coming.
Tom chose to stay.
Tom's in the process.
There's a print here.
I didn't do it in time.
Please, fix it.
It looks good.
The show has to go on.
This dog is gay.
I want you to inform Mr. Brown of his pager.
Tom doesn't really talk much about his problems.
Tom stopped Mary from being more careful.
I wonder how long she'll continue.
It's very loose.
Well, it didn't matter who helped him, as long as there was someone like that.
I paid him four dollars.
I don't feel ready for it yet.
Tom took everything.
I'll tell the team you're here.
Sudja Gadella's food.
A satellite of spirit seats that can reach speeds of more than 1,800 km.
I don't suffer jokes.
Why are you mad at me?
You should have locked up or at least closed all the doors.
Turn the light off before you go to sleep.

It's time to play the Jacker.
I can't find anything wrong.
All right.
He wears a colorful chocolate dress, with pockets with rooms, and two pockets that were always full of themselves, which were wrapped at tonight's dinner, Philipghis love.
Surprisingly, they showed up in a place.
He had such a headache, that he had to leave the meeting.
I'm not surprised at your foot.
I'm only buying expensive cars.
The heavy rain is strong on the surface.
2005 was a hard year for the music, because Kelly Minog had a heart attack.
You're old enough to take care of yourself.
I went with my sister to protect the animals.
Look what I found on the beach.
I'll leave school.
I'm nervous.
Lucky Tom at the end of the thing turned out to be.
He's a bad driver.
Good morning, Tom.
That's enough for now.
What didn't you tell me?
Tom was born in Boston and grew up in it.
Tom's got an eyelash.
He was at home.
You're smart.
Why do I have to suffer?
I didn't have to work very hard.
I'm not falling.
She's not high.
I pulled the trigger on the wall.
People are so selective today.
Where are the kids?
Tom, you're gonna have to put your balls down.
That's where the book needs to be written in great terms.
I have to finish this job by Tuesday.
Tom isn't such a man.
I'm grateful for the mistake.
You see, I told you you can.
At least there's an open head.
There's no other than God.
My friend, George, we're going to the summer.
Tom didn't buy anything I asked him to.
Today is a day of hunger that cannot be burned.
Tom's afraid of the fall.
I'm not working at the end of the week.
If you're suffering with your shoes, don't forget to pay him a living.
Tom never told me who he was last night.
What happens to us after death?
Here's her picture.
Mary got the most out of the big organ in the church.
We drove everything together.
Tom's gonna suffer.
I'll be in the car.
"Did they break the law?" "Yes, they could finally pass it."
Please ask someone else.

This day looks like a test of courage.
There were more than a thousand seats in the village.
I love you so much!
I'm ready to finish it.
It's not boring to hear voices when you eat Mark.
Please don't say anything about you.
The river will be broken.
I just wanted to give you a lesson.
I'm not surprised he's speaking the truth.
You're wasting everything.
Tom did his best to hide his loss.
It's up to me.
I'm sure I'll do it.
I'm taking the will.
The art was perfect.
The dogs belong to her.
Tom managed to cross the river in her life.
That's it!

Tom Potter without an advance message.
I'm adding this judge now.
Even the clock from Colek shows the right time twice a day.
Don't leave your drink with no sense.
Are you ready to take a moment on your shoes?
Make it one and always.
I hope you'll be able to help us.
It's a print from a book.
I came because I asked for a smoke.
Tom and Mary are playing cops and thieves.
Are you all too many when she left?
Don't be so stupid!
I'm not sure what Tom means.
If you're tired, go to sleep!
I think it's okay.
I don't need anything.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
You look just like your big brother.
I like Lag.
It's not just about learning to sleep, history or geography.
Tom was definitely interested, but he tried to hide it.
Can you talk about my kids when I get out of here?
Is there anyone here?
She's a country.
I'm a little stupid.
I didn't usually know the lady.
The concert was successful.
Let's see what else we can find out about this.
I was wondering what the third one of Tom's.
I'll be a prisoner of gratitude if you can do that for me.
The continued power causes self-sustainment.
I guess it won't bother you, I'll take one of them.
I know what to do.
I have to meet Tom.
It's called 100.
I didn't intend to do that, but now that you're suggesting, maybe I'll try.
At the end of something, he's also upset about a big deal.
Everyone liked you.
I'm sorry to say that your haircuts have come from Tommy.
It's your hat, isn't it?
What do you want?
You finished reading this novel?
We have a duty to legalize.
To know it's one thing, to learn it's another thing.
The birds shout in a loud voice inside a deaf bird.
They're all sitting down.
Tom might have been upset.
You have to go.
You had to save something on a day off.
The kid's coming in through the back door.
You're tired, aren't you?
You didn't buy it.
You can make time on the phone.
I was gonna go there.
I did it.
I'm upset when I'm allowed to wait.
I'm gonna hide in the ears every time I play with my group in that club.
I wanted you to sleep to help me.
What are you talking about?
He shot me.
I like to feel you.
He liked himself when he said he was the best player.
If I knew about that, I'd tell you.
Can you do the job or not?
I want to learn a Tigris language.
Guess who I am.
We're private.
You're gonna give us what we asked for?
I'm close to touching.
Tom bought a new tender.

It was during the winter when the bones of my father's prophet were broken.
I'm sorry, I have to leave you.

I don't know what book to choose.
He won American territory.
You're Doody's son?
The first American poets arrived in the 17th century.
There's a sign on the ring.
I think we should still try.
It's a trap.
How dangerous is it?

Sleep is for the weak.
If we give him another chance, he'll do as much as he can.
It's not always hot.
Tom couldn't have gotten involved.
I'll never forget what happened here today.
I'm pretty careful.
Did you hear that?
Still, somehow you did.
Tom definitely doesn't want to.
Was it an incident or an advance plan?
We've been hiding together.
The Hebrew in his mouth is her own.
I'll ask them to join you.
I visited Tom in Boston.
You should be more careful.
We're an active group.

I was almost drunk.
The count has been added fast.
They respect him.
I've seen it before.
I forgot the secret code.
You really thought you were coming back at such an hour.
I lived her on my feet.
He's got his hair on his head.
Tom's a nice guy.
She was a gold man.
Tom let Mary take the call.
Let's hear your lecture.
Just do it.
I'm sure you'll love it.
It turns out it's true.
He doesn't have the abilities.
If I knew what her address was, I'd write it to her.
Tom's pretty good.
Let's go this weekend.
A good detective.
I can't go with them.
The company's building a bathroom in China.
Tom doesn't care about me at all.
The white dog's on its way to a size open.
Of course she's speaking English.
Tom's on the alert.
I don't need any good!
They changed everything.
He was standing by the gate with his hand in his pocket.
Put the gun down.
Are you ready to stop the walker and come back?
I thought your concert was successful yesterday.
What a waste!
I thought it was right.
The service of the war left many places in its fragile body.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You might be able to talk to Tom later today.
Let's keep it between us.
The king ordered that the throne be set free.
Tom's been attacked at home.
I asked him to keep my pockets.
They'll leave their children in the woods.
It's your fault.
Are you sure you don't want to come with us?
I want my son to be a mechanic.
At least tell me how you feel.
There's no toilet paper left.
Tom's pointing the gun at Mary when John shot him.
Tell everyone I've been married.
He doesn't bless the people for peace.

Is that our hotel?
Sometimes we've seen so far.
Thank you for remembering.
He stopped participating in the contest.
She didn't want him to leave the room.
Eggys is a real maniac.
They're both gay.
I'm sorry I've been sleeping you so long.

I like to read.

There's a lot of beautiful mountains in the mountains.
Tom saw what Mary did.
Go to the party at my place?
The judge asked the jury to hold the case.
I need to check you guys first.
I need to get you out of here.
Maybe my dad'll be in the next car.
Tom's waiting for it.
We should be better than that.
It was a difficult task to ask for Mary.
Take your voice off, please.
We can deal with an army force; we can't deal with an enemy of ideas.
I mean to keep a party.
I missed you today.
Please forgive me.
I love her.
We're going to shut up a joke.
A reindeer's meat makes me sick.
Tom can't wait to see you.
Let's set at 3:00.
I owe you beer.
The "be" function is in a way that's funny in all languages.

What's the price you're asking for?
I've never played golf, but I think I'll try.
I won't be late on the second day, and not on the third.
You're complaining about my fate.
I agreed to go.
He's responsible.
It's a little bit.
A milk litre of food when three made it white.
He made a mistake and drank rale.
What's the smell?
Let's not do this anymore.
Everyone knows I hate you.
Meadori ate the most common food.
Too, Tom and Mary passed the three.
There's nothing to wait for.
She figured out her way through the crowd.
They're everywhere.
Don't you ever get a cure?
Can you see the difference?
I've got it.
There's evidence that Tom was responsible for Mary's death.
As a musical hero, usually, early age.
I blessed him for his success.
You run every day?
I tried not to do that.
What did Tom do to help Mary?
The plane's flying over the hill.
I went to sleep very late.
Mary happened about her age.
People live in a dead area because of lack of water.
Tom's gonna miss you.
What's wrong with I'm gonna pay the bill?
Mary's been living at a future event for many years.
He's changed a few words.
What exactly do you want us to do?
I don't want to shoot you, but I'll do it if necessary.
It's still red hair.
They went to the bottom of the road.
He never opened his mouth without complaining about something.
Tom took Mary to the station.
You can't see the atoms in your fucking eyes.
I didn't mean it'd go so far.
I'm afraid I don't have an experience.
Cuff sees, Cuff does.
She's pregnant.
You're not gonna eat it?
When I gave it to the bus I watched in an accident.
His behavior really surprised me.
I don't have anything to do with this flower.
I called my parents.
I don't know why they did it.
They became husband and wife.
Good medicine is Mara.
I'm sorry, I couldn't write it before, because I was sick.
Tom wants to know when you're gonna get here.
Tom made it like he was wearing the river from yesterday.
I didn't see anyone around.
I'm going to the theater next door.
That's the motivation for a positive response.
I love your name.
None of these clothes are good in my eyes.
Tom's sitting at home embarrassed.
I warned Tom to keep away from Mary.
I need to translate.
I'm sorry I missed the party.
I can tell you how you felt.
I know you don't like me.
Tom's trying to touch Mary.
You found the right one.
For three brothers.
Who else uses tattoos in your office?
Put on the shirt.
He's getting hurt.
I'm glad you're here.

Can you stand up on your birthday?
I couldn't see his shirt's color because it was too dark outside.
I'm too busy to make lunch.
That's an endless response.
Tom didn't even complain.
That's weird.
Let's learn this justice here.
He asked me if I knew her phone number.
My ideas are good for him.
I think he's fucked up.
That's what I'd say.
I want to buy a new computer.
The most popular bet in America.
Why are you visiting Australia?
When he wrote in English, he was interested in most words.
I'm confused.
Everyone has something to hide.
I'm sorry it was just for him.
Tom's gone crazy, you know.
Tom's hurt.
The tower was quite steep and quite unusual today, and most of it's quiet as a tree.
Tom's usually playing classic music.
Why did he leave his job?
I mean, it's usually out of the ordinary.
You think I couldn't finish it until five?
I don't care what you're doing.
She forgot to write it.
You think you're smart?
She's suggesting she might be studying in the past.
And how do you feel about this job?
You're analopes.
It's better to be nervous than to hear it.
What's wrong with him?
Esther's Jewish grandmother.

And don't even move!
Tom touched me.
You're between friends.
You want to have fun?
I saw it.
You should be super.
What's this big building?
I'm here to find out.
I can't explain something I don't understand.
You're rich?
Get off the horse, Tom.
We don't have any opposition you'll join us in our club.
They look sad.
In Asparato, they don't usually get out of there.
He's a rich man, but he's rich.
Are you sure about that?
This Roman is hot.
We've been on a long way.
Every sin leads to its own consequences.
We were inconceivable.
The bike was in a coma.
The fruit of something that is planted on the surface of the surface of the soil of the ground will easily be joined together in unity.

Tell me about it!
Are you less balanced?
We can do much better.

Use my place.
Tom died three days later.
I'm glad I left Boston.
As the time of the end drew near, Jesus arrived in Jerusalem.

When you have to create something, I have two left hands.
The team's government by the team and through the team won't go over the surface of the ground.
They've got three kids now.
Tom Phone.
I don't care who does this.
The change didn't completely raise the number of accidents in the city.
The elevators are already in our box.
They've got to prevent fights: they're always aggressive and sometimes they're convincing.
Come to my house.
That's the five thousand in Clingon in Towa!
Don't do anything stupid like deciding to go with Tom.
How can I get you back good?
I'll be back in time.
I appreciate the offer.
You're not allowed to break the rules.
She's herself.
Tom's taller than me in the head.
We need to talk about it.
I don't have a chance to make it.
I'm sick.
There's no difference between srcram and censorship.
Tom went upstairs.
What a big door!
I got a letter from a friend.
Tom can tell us about this?
She's a beautiful, self-contained girl.
I'm afraid I need to go now.
Did Tom get hurt?
Give me a hug.
It's Tom's dream to live in the mountains.
She's very popular in China too.

It's all gone to waste.
Give me a toothbrush.
I knew I could give you confidence.
I didn't shoot a thief.
We'll be back after this publication.
Just when I was going to sleep, the phone rang.
We're starting out once.
Don't let them win.
Mike's the youngest in the family.
You can't scare me.
When he's asleep, we're going to steal.
Why does the phone call all the time only when I'm busy?
Hey, you!
Who do you think I am?
You're drinking until you're out.
We're right.
Tom told me I had to leave immediately.
If you want to lose weight, you need to be careful at your desk.
Agns is looking at the hottest.
The cells are added to the price.
There's no doubt about his honesty.
Is there any other medical problems?
Tom scared me.
I want to raise a box to respect our dear friend, Michael.
I'm behind the kitchen.
That's a lie, of course.
You can't underestimate the importance of the choice of friends.
How are you tonight, Tom?
I'm working on your pain.

He's closer.
I tried to make you touch.
I need more time.
We had the pleasure of sharing glagies.
Don't leave me.
You must listen to your mother's advice.
I want them to stop Tom from killing him.
He's good at golf.
Just leave.
Tom won't like it.
I'm not getting an e-mail today.
It was in Oxford that learned history.
The most infamous war between England and Scotland came to an end.
And he'll get out of it without harm?
Dan didn't take part in Linda's scream.
You'll get it.
Tom helped Mary get out of the pool.
We're doing a detachment.
On the leg we're finding crossword puzzles and five matches with birds.
It was so nice to see you again.
In this word they don't usually use it.
Tom's wearing dirty shoes.
It's Tom's cat's grave.
Tom is now that he had to let Mary do her.
Judy's gonna laugh at me.
I'm sorry, that's right.
Tom gave me a lot of trees.
Tom's gone.
The Mermita is an almanac.
I'll tell you where I went.
It's a lot of hard work.
Tom helped everybody.
What am I gonna say to you about this?
The bird's been broken.
I don't want to lose Mary.
Tom's part of the sugar team.
Is that serious?
I need it yesterday.
A dog is wearing it in his leg.
How did you change your clothes so fast?
I wish I had the courage to do this.
She gave it there for every flower in the garden.
Do you have those shoes on my side?
Who do you think wrote the novel?
Tom likes kisses and kisses.
I know Tom liked it.
It's probably important.
I don't know where Tom's mine is.
Maybe you'd like some of that.
Your party won the election at the vote fair.
I'll tell you about your shoes.
This restaurant's always busy.
David is very active.
Is that right?
He's the best.
I'm Jewish too.
Tom likes our son.
I was a student of art in our time.
We all wish world peace forever.
No one can know everything.
The road accident memory is still Trey in our memory.
He's sorry about his crimes.
Tom's ready to get me now?
The week was busy all the time.
Where's the Goma bear?
I can see the scale from where I stand.
I've arranged for you to have some privacy.
Get my clothes.
I just want it.
I hate sports.
She put the paper on the table.
What could even happen?
China's farm and El Hodo are near the food chain of any other nation.
What do you want to eat?
He always fails his intentions.
My mom's probably gonna say no.
The air is stuck in my father's chest.
I've got a terrible feeling.
We're short.
Don't give up on me.
You better get back here.
That's really weird.
Your watch is on the office.
I'm really tired.
Tom is very valuable in his community.
They look happy.
Tom went home on his own.
My house is close to the sea.
This is one woman too much.
Tom and Mary Bello together.
There's always a ring.
Do you love him?
I went to wash in the river yesterday.
Don't move.
Just tell me who to call.
I don't deserve it.
And you think you're looking at Cuba, and you're actually looking at poverty.
Is it true that I believe in it?
Never stop telling the truth.
I still have to fill my office.
Tom's gonna blow up the success and put it on the top of the table.
I asked Tom why.
Don't you want to move forward?
Tom was surprised to see how much my mom ran since she saw her last few months ago.
I don't know why she's gone.
I can deal with it.
That's weird.
I'm a very old man; how old I don't know.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
What kind of popular songs today?
I want to make it clear in cash.
Why aren't you kidding me?
This section is now closed to the board.
Tom told me a lot about you.
This decision will be the long-distance to strike and kill.
He said he'd regret the decision.
My wife is good with my mom.
We're sold there by the superman.
It's not a phone call between friends.
I was wondering if you'd want me out for a bath.
What a lucky young man!
No stupid questions.
I don't like Annas.
Too close.
Everybody okay?
I was just thinking about you.
Abtel.
The answer got us into the magic field.
The sound was clear but offensive.
You're right.
It's very stressful.
"Why don't you come?" "Because I don't want to."
Was I really so happy?
Tom and I left immediately, but Mary stayed waiting for John.
Tom didn't tell anyone what.
I'm nervous.
I have four brothers.
The birthday party is worth the next night.
Let's check it out later.
Are they worried about you?
We trusted you.
Tom didn't find anything.
I've grown up with Tom.
I thought you'd get a shot.
I think he's eating something like ten steps.
When does it start?
Let's see if we can make it next time.
The road accident happened just before.
I was gonna call him, but I forgot.
It's unfortunate.
Is that serious?
It was a risk of a foreign war.
He's a French journalist.
Tom looked through the door.
I've never been there, but I think it's over this hall.
I have no problem telling you what I know.
She wants to live in town.
My brother's watching TV.
I'm sorry, but the answer is no.
I understand your feelings.
Even though I was tired, I did everything I could.
What's the difference between American English and British?
Don't get excited, I'm a doctor.
I felt it.
I knew he was reading.
Most boys like Baseball.
He has three sons.
Don't forget to send the letter on the way to school.
I'll see you in 20 minutes.
I'm kidding.
Tom's bed is empty.
I've got a disease and children.
I don't like math.
It's going to rain more than three hours.
I know you're waiting for it.
I feel old.
Tom didn't have kids.
I'm kind of hungry.
I didn't know my nose was broken.
He's married to his daughter of the hero.
I knew it was our price offerings, but I wanted to buy it anyway.
I hope we meet again in the future.
After the crash, get up on the fast road.
You understand that I wasn't born to be paid - the art comes out of nature pushing me forward.
Not tonight.
In one girl, the job lost his balance.
He's got a girlfriend.
Tom's reading history book.
I know it's not Tom's fault.
Are you a judge?
I don't know if I have time for it.
She chose a white-colored choice.
In addition to being an open man, he was also super famous.
I bought a hat but I lost it.
How can we afford all this?
When do you care what's going on?
Are you interested in your work?
He's got more books than all the rest together.
Welcome to the seats.
I'm sure they're talking about what happened.
Are you ready to pass this on?
Do you want to do this or not?
If you don't understand, ask.
There's nothing more important than friends.
If something is a good idea or not, it's not an idea.
The story was so hard I couldn't follow.
I found Tom's hiding place.
Tom never would have allowed it.
What are you learning?
Let him answer his request.
Tom said something on the phone I didn't understand.
Bob's gonna be home at 6:00.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Tom looks good.
I'm looking for this key.
It can eat four glasses.
When we asked what's different between American men and their fellow men from Europe, Ziza Gabor answered, "The Atlantic Ocean, baby."
Look here.
Tom's got the locker.
Don't touch your computer.
He was an example of a sports career in our time.
Look at the bird.
I wonder what made it happen.
Dead breath.
I'm asking myself who did this.
I'm Chinese.
Put it on my desk until tomorrow.
We talked last.
It's personal matter.
They're on their own.
Don't forget to prepare your homework.
How do you know all this?
Before you go out, close the doors.
He's sitting down and the scene goes down to the radio.
They threw the hats into the air.
I spent my reading time yesterday instead of going out.
His father always comes home late.
My brother bought himself a electric guitar.
Don't resist him.
I'm asking for every dream of a request.
Are you crazy?
Who doesn't like Mored?
I don't like her behavior.
To the baby, it's a change of face.
You got here fast.
I mistakenly explained that he's my brother.
I can't see anything.
He'll hold his hand.
You're imagining things.
I've been learning English for five years.
At least there's four years of support.
He didn't just throw himself out of money, but also the family.
He's not worth anything.
I can't get over the separation from you.
I want to know how it's possible.
Where's my dad?
According to the warrant, I'll be down tomorrow.
I've got a hard fossil.
Is there a bathroom for young people around this place?
If you were helping me, I'd be successful.
You'll be there early.
I didn't mean to do that.
At least try to be careful.
Tom looks sleepy.
It's time for lunch.
There's no room here for four people.
Don't move!
That's your letter.
That's all we've done.
Tom kept us busy.
Have you already sent him a credit card for Christmas?
I got into the rain and I got off.
Tom likes to ride.
I've been looking online for Portuguese education.
Did you call?
Tom refused to give Mary any information.
He was to blame for his parents.
We have things to do.
Tom likes to play with fire.
I decided to tell her I love her.
Your computer isn't completely safe.
Jane sometimes wanted to go to school.
You can meet in person if you go to her book.
Are you asleep?
Tom couldn't say any more.
He lived there alone.
Her behavior was my main concern.
You're about to lose everything.
Sleep deep.
How are you today?
You better hang out with your teacher.
I'd like to learn this language, but I don't need to do it.
Are you ready to sign the list?
Tom has to get him back the basic payment.
Is that your wallet?
Are they treating a dog?
Tom's answer.
I just want to focus on power.
I have to find a way to earn a lot of money.
I see you've done a good dream.
Once you've decided to get into a profession, you can't change your mind in a fight.
If I were in the place, I wouldn't be holding hands yet.
Tom announced it in a calm voice.
It depends on how you deal with it.
I'll teach you everything you need to know.
You're honest.
I'm kidding you.
You have five minutes to solve this type.
Where's my hat?
The eight will not be good for health.
You taught Mr. White, not Mrs. Green.
Tom told me everything about it.
The apartment was quiet.
I appreciate your efforts.
Tom thought I might be interested.
Can I talk to Mr. Johnson?
You want a hit?
Please ask your sister to pay for the rules.
Get out, please.
I'm sorry, we're closed.
I don't know why Tom did it.
No one agrees with me.
He chose a pregnant couple who would fit in with his replacement.
How big is he?
Ntplax is now in Europe.
I like to learn.
Everyone in the office got involved in how it was handled.
Mary's pretty spacious.
I know you were worried about Tom.
A dog shot after a cat.
Please lock the door before you get out.
In the market where I bought the vegetables I could buy flowers as well.
Tom was probably interested in Mary's gift.
You like to sing?
A number of road accidents are on her.
Whatever you say.
Tom offered to fill me home.
The room was on a modern stage.
I love my house.
I'll get your ass.
Tom's been hiding behind the shower villa.
You think I'm too tall?
I took it from him, of course.
Tom's putting each other's arms on the other and looking them up in front of the wall.
I like going to the beach.
Maybe they have what you want.
I'm willing to agree with you.
Tom opened the window on.
For sale.
Tom took the key from the door.
I don't know if I have enough money.
They're going to drive your car.
Tom's bleeding the car, but he left the front lights on.
This girl's too proud.
Tom's got all his money in the box and hid it under his bed.
You don't look confused.
It's a cold situation.
It's better if we check it out.
She never managed to get rid of the pain after the accident.
I agree with you.
That's as good a reason as anyone else.
She sends him a key.
I've been watching TV this morning.
Do you care what they think?
It's making it feel hard for you.
Do you think it's an accident?
I'm writing a song in German.
How'd it go with you today?
Michael Phillips is now the Olympic warrior who has received the greatest wealth in history.
Stop trying.
Dogs know how to laugh.
Call the ambulance?
May I even have a chance with Tom?
What are you looking for?
The cops broke into the house.
I want everything to be as it was before.
There were four present.
I can't hide it from you.
She was already sick for a week when they called the doctor.
Do you want to be my servant and follow me?
I did it?
Did you choose these songs yourself?
Dan's got a new computer.
He's mad at you that you didn't take part in the last meeting.
Would you like something to eat?
I can get to school in ten minutes.
I don't know what you're gonna do.
What I hate most is that he pretends he had good grades at school even though he didn't learn.
What's the depth?
Laws have to be made.
He's got a big family on him to France.
Was it hard?
What is less - a kilogram of gold or a kilogram of money?
We're glad to help.
I'll make sure they get you into jail.
They're not always jealous of their parents.
It doesn't mean you don't have to be careful.
Follow him.
Let's see how Tom responds to it.
The smell makes me sick.
Three fourths of the earth's surface is covered in water.
It's my dad's dick.
It's food.
It sounds like a threat.
It's boring and moving in the same spirit.
I hear you're going to the United States.
I'm too nervous to prepare my homework.
The relationship "A' loves Be" isn't rephasive, it's not transgenic and it's not symmetrical.
We'll be right down.
I'll be hungry.
I like your coffee.
He explained the moral meaning of the court.
I don't think I can keep up for a long time.
"Can you give me the sugar?" "Please."
And a lot more.
You're free to go.
I just want you to know I'm kidding.
I don't have any objections.
She lived in the Krevans.
He's out of the room.
Tom couldn't focus on his job.
I want to do it properly.
You look worried.
What about the glasses?
I'd like you to know Tom.
Check it out, please, and tell me what you think about it.
Tom's gonna have to get out of school to meet us.
I just did what my boss asked.
He started writing a novel.
How much room up?
Show me the baby you bought yesterday.
You guys been home last night?
What are we supposed to do?
I couldn't be happier for you.
We think about a lot of solutions.
To find out the answer to that question, I went to the city library.
I can't believe I'm saying it in a calm voice.
He's studying next to his desk.
He should have been a player.
In the days we're doing longer.
I stayed in town all night.
I'm going to a million times.
Tom put him in the face.
Tom's moving pretty easily.
That's not exactly how it happened.
She married him for money.
We didn't read a wedding.
Something's not as good as it is.
That's a great feeling.
She set up her house to meet.
Don't go anywhere, okay?
Just tell us what's going on.
We stood at the entrance to get our guest face.
I got angry.
This art is very exciting.
You have a car, don't you?
What happened there?
Tom owns a car business.
Some people like sports and others don't.
Um, now it's really weird...
People respond to support.
Everyone likes music.
I'm crying.
Tom's the hottest guy.
My hand watch is a little quick.
At the time of the Soviets, every government was making progress.
How do we know he's not real?
They're right.
I like tennis more than any kind of sport.
That wasn't so good.
It's your birthday day, isn't it, Yuri?
Take his car keys.
After all, it's all over.
You heard about Mary.
Tom's been trying to figure it out.
We agree completely.
Younger, his father represents powers.
Maybe you'd like some of that.
Give us a call!
I hope you'll be here soon.
It was very easy.
Soon my father will be 40.
What's this key?
I hope you know more quickly than a number of Dutch courts.
I haven't made my decision yet.
We just got Tom to work.
Tom's making a cut.
I've worked it out. It's a nightmare.
You think it'll fit here?
She's proud of her colony.
I'm worried about health insurance.
Human beings are the only people with symptoms or they need symptoms.
What did you buy your company for Christmas?
He rushed to blow up the time I lost.
Am I supposed to miss a date?
Get your keys.
Is it working?
I need a ball.
We're going to get some fresh air.
Tom's still waiting for you.
We've been working hours on a motion check.
Tom and I just met.
In addition to English, she's talking stupidly.
Tom's got a vision.
He's neither good nor bad.
Tom died of internal injuries.
She's speaking Spanish.
I'm sure that's it.
She disappeared from him.
A walk in the thousands says to climb up one mountain and down later.
Tom's always on the move.
She failed in her attempt to push up.
Tom looks pretty upset.
She's a little girl.
The newspaper publishes Fredia from an hour ago on the president's reputation.
I think the plan was perfect.
Shut up and listen!
It's almost 7:00 a.m. and I haven't finished chemistry yet tomorrow.
He said, "I'm Canada."
My mother forgot to add a ship to the salad.
He's not going to be in one ear.
Is that what the government wants?
We'll help.
Please remember to send the letter on the way home.
I miss my secret school very much.
Your plan is working.
You've fallen your ass.
Dad and Mom went to the party.
I know something you don't know.
She blew up in the shower.
Is this deep down working for the government?
The city's servants' cries have all been heard.
More in the voice.
See you at lunch.
I'm learning oxygen.
I think that's what you need to worry about now.
Tom's bleeding the car and he's playing the front lights.
You were so good to me.
The school's on the roof.
There was a scar.
Don't remind me.
She's what a pregnant woman does.
We don't know much about personal history.
Is this car stopping at Conshan?
I told you I'd protect you.
Stop bothering me.
How would they find out?
I paid two hundred dollars a month.
And who's accused of being easy?
I'm not stopping their change.
Oh, let me show you.
I want to raise a cat to my life, Tom and Mary.
You want kids?
I raised myself out.
You need to prepare your homework now.
I suggest you put the gun down.
John left for the cold last night.
What they said to me, we're not right.
Hamd can stand on the mountain slopes, but it won't make it up high.
Listen to me and walk away until we're upset.
At the end of the thing she did.
He's thanking everyone for having a nice voice.
My dad's a big bear.
I'm tired of her death.
We built a new house to save eight thousand dollars.
Tom started drinking.
The water's starting to melt.
Tom didn't know which bus to take.
I like to kiss Mary.
It's been raining since the first day.
Let me explain it to you by permission.
Don't drink too much, okay?
The students' duties are to clean up their cars.
If you're against him, we can keep him behind bars forever.
I just wanted to see how you'd react.
They've got their hands on them, okay?
Let's taste it!
Where's Mafia?
Tom said you were here.
She's armed to me, not him.
Everybody loves you.
I'll listen to you, especially when we don't agree.
I see it as a positive answer.
You're a guard.
Mary China in Kate's popularity.
It's a big story.
If you do that, you'll be lying and cheating.
The decision was not a surprise.
Tom didn't leave a place for the parties.
It's very attractive to you.
The flowers go by weight and size.
It's the direction that took us around the flight.
She went out for a ride this morning on a horse.
No one knows what got him so upset.
Tom's doing a few things too different times.
For children to be raised by their parents.
He's gonna be an old man.
He didn't know what to do.
Tom looks open.
To see Naples and die.
You should talk to such a man.
Tom and Mary looked at the movie.
I'm sick.
I'm sure you're gonna let it go.
I can recognize it's about the way he talks.
Take your stuff.
I bought the tape.
Is that red?
I need someone's help.
You know who I am?
How can I stop this court?
What's the thing I left behind?
He wants it from his current state.
How's this ring?
Tom needs to look out.
He'll die.
I want to learn German in addition to English.
I need to get some balls.
I want my parents to be proud.
Put her down.
Prices up.
I'm not rocking for you.
Are you going to the lab next month?
Tom gave it to the car driver.
There's now a lot of garbage in the place where the school building was first.
What do you think you're doing?
That sounds crazy.
The competition's over.
Who are you talking to?
Look, he's coming.
What kind of information do you get from a license?
Are you tired?
They can't stop your life.
Tom looks like he's out of his mind.
You bought the envelope Mike last night.
Let me take care of it for you.
Tom canned Mary.
Tom War?
Their job was to open up time to get the company out of business.
The tears will help relieve the pain.
Tom said he thinks he can cross the line.
I don't buy it.
I wanted to let you know.
Tom doesn't visit here as much as he used to.
Tom taught Mary how to protect herself.
Who do you want to talk to?
I felt like crying.
Can you tell me where Tom went?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Most of the accidents are read up to 18 kilometers from home.
Mary lived in town.
We all die sooner or later.
Don't move.
Do you care about the environment?
You're making your homework?
I think we need a break.
Tom's lost every corner of hope.
She's wearing clothes.
Your dreams have come true.
You want to go?
I can't change between them.
Tom's eating fast.
It's so different.
Alex on most is just a regular bird.
I feel like a miracle.
Tom's been driving his ass carefully.
Thank you for your love.
She's poor hair.
Tom told Mary not to waste her time trying to convince John to help.
Unlike you, I can identify my mistakes.
The profit of something that our influence of some situation would only partially replace the actual records at the same time.
Mom was hit.
My brother's guardian?
That's great!
There's no reason for this.
I'm nervous.
The wall depends on watch.
She's alive with joy.
You're coming here soon?
In any case, there can only be one queen.
Also that he was weak when he was a baby, now he's very strong.
I don't want to make you trouble.
I'm buying my sister a new suit.
They can't break it.
I asked what land he came from and he said, "I'm going east of the world."
I don't know any of them.
Bring him a drink.
It's their turn.
I'm always six.
Don't worry too much.
Tom doesn't know much about Seth, does he?
Be careful!
I need to know who's coming.
He had answers.
Are you almost ready?
You're gonna have to go to bed and you're gonna have to go to bed.
I saw Tom Pellett with my wife.
Tom tried to convince Mary to prepare for his homework.
Tom's been hit by a mountain type.
Tom knows how to laugh.
I dreamed of you.
Tom's lifted his head back.
Tom didn't give Mary much.
The building car.
I'm the only one who knows them.
If we just stop trying to be happy, we'll actually have absolutely no bad.
I'm ready to get out of here.
Let's try to be reasonable about this.
I had more than five dollars.
He's blind, but I still don't like him.
Mary's upset.
The company will start the new drug outbreak next month.
Maybe it's Gorley.
All right, all right, all right.
He's got the bag in his pocket.
Tom broke up on Mary's car and stole what was looked like under the driver's seat.
I'll get you the account right away.
You need to visit.
You cleaned your clothes.
Beautiful girls dream about him.
Throw your tires on the car and I'll take you home.
He's a nice man.
Tom really didn't want to deal with the situation.
The first time in England was a bad king.
My dad always reads a newspaper before breakfast.
I think it's the only way to get rid of cats.
She wants to see a younger one.
I don't have to clean up dogs' shit.
Do you really like this place?
Tom's the one who painted this picture.
He's an FBI agent.
Tom usually wears a blanket of eggs for a week and only then he grabs them.
They're disgusting.
He's paying for a credit card.
I don't care if Tom gets hurt or not.
Hey, lack of mercy.
I'll walk. It'll happen.
Last breath.
I need a little face for myself.
A few moves out.
Tom's a friend in the order of Aduk.
She weighs 50 pounds.
You don't even look like him.
I didn't give a shit when I was in Sparta.
You don't like me?
I really don't care what's going on inside your head.
Detective Tom.
I'll ask you to pass on these documents in secret.
Stop hurting me.
I'm afraid I can see him.
Something weird has gone wrong.
I think it's a good idea.
There's nothing I can do here anymore.
It'll help.
Now, Tury.
I know how dangerous this will be.
I like to find out.
You look very tired.
They're amazing.
I guess it's time to go.
Tom was tired before, but now he's gone.
Tom's out of his mind.
She's not less beautiful than her mother.
What's Gadgett's test?
She took the Romanian question straight away.
Fuck you!
They wrote about him in a bad paper.
It's better to take you with her.
She's waiting for you at home.
The lights kept my eyes from the beating.
Tom was out of his mind.
I loved you.
He wants to work at the plant.
I have a new partner I've called him Dan.
Tom's gonna be fine.
I thought it was ridiculous.
Go on and say it.
It's not my duty to share Tom's plans.
My father cut down a tree with a stick.
We've met a couple of people in college.
They're all crazy.

Don't even try to suspect it.
I can't drink coffee.
Of course there's a clue what to hide.
I can appreciate what happened to you.
He likes cars.
Can you tell me some color?
How did you solve the problem?
Have you enjoyed the show?

Tom told Mary that it's not a good idea to get out of the park alone.
I heard you could buy here any weapon you want.
It can't be true.

I don't suffer jokes.
Don't move!
I'm sure things will change for the better.
How dare you ask me for help?
You're an astute.
You want me to take care of it?
Mary can cry.
I'm pretty aggressive.
It sounds like a place.
You're gonna have to leave it behind.
I'm looking forward to it in prison.
He tried to put his life on hold.
I knew sleep didn't mean harm.
Tom missed me.
Let's deal with the second question first.
They've all been carefully watched.
Unmerited competition.
Light, fire and fire are weapons of war.
I want to know right away when something happens.
Please don't touch it.
There's eggs on the roof.
In the meantime, milk was still popular as a medicine.
I need the tape.
I don't think you should have done that.
Nice to meet you.
Where's your visitor meat?
It's just for you to have hours.
I didn't let him wait.
All my friends are kids.
Is that what happened to her?
Anyone home?
I came here to talk to you.
I'm adding this court now.
You're missing too much information.
You win!
We're working hard to finish the show by October.
I like Skye.
Maybe you're suffering from brain damage.
We have two ears.
You didn't buy.
I don't need you.
I know you'll do what you need.
We have a good team here.
But your accent is psychotic!
Will you ever lock these glasses again?
You don't have to convince me.
I can't eat meat.
What's her name sugar?
But we've been without him.
I want to show you my pictures.
He's got a little bit less clauptera than he's got, history was different.
I'm worried I took the ring away.
Don't get out of this place, you understand?
You'll have a picture of the real girls on this show.
I think his mind is very important.
Sometimes I'm hurt by the baby.
Did they make progress?
I started to be impatient.
In what ways did the show show show up?
He's going to the book to read books.
We'll be together soon.
We need to know.
I know you appreciate Tamm.
What can we do to help you?
We don't want another accident.
Tom's holding a pretty dog in his lab.
Don't worry about life. The one who deserves life and your faith will really make it happen to you.
- It's gonna hurt yourself. - I'm gonna kill you.
We have to attack.
Sometimes I use numbers as an open box.
I want you to know I'm not interested in catching him.
My blood is no longer red for you.
Is that the key you're looking for?
It's funny.
You look decent.
I almost got it.
I just want to talk to Tom for a few minutes.
We have bigger problems to deal with.
Tom went to open the door but found out she's already opened.
Tom's gonna kill me.
Her mother wasn't as old as she looks.
What am I supposed to do?
I dreamed I'd come to college.
Tom was too upset.
It's a court.
I'd like to work in my account for a little bit of money.
I hate what you're doing.
A smile is the best medicine.
His words hurt her.
I slept all day, 'cause it was the first day.
We turned around with no purpose in the shopping area.
And of course you'll keep the receipt.
I should've lied.
Tom can help Mary.
You want a week?
I can't believe you're gonna beat me up, but I'm not afraid you're gonna make an effort.
Have you ever been to the fair?
I've already made films.
Look at this picture second.
Can I get the TV?
Your idea is confusing.
I'm a stranger here.
I'll get up early in the morning.
I don't have any enemies.
The teacher forced us to return to the word.
Please come back.
The gift to the secret floor.
He's been home after ten months.
I'm afraid there's no smoke.
I'm calling Roman of Sydney Leddon.
I can put you in jail if you need.
You're scared, aren't you?
You knew them, didn't you?
There's no hiding place.
I smelled.
It'll be good for everyone.
Write your name here.
It's time you told her the truth.
Ettelf is no more than Yonk.
Why did you lie?
I grew your trust in the river.
I'll leave it to you.
I told her to wait a little longer.
She's gonna sit on the ledge.
It's a lot of trouble.
I like Baseball.
I won't blame him for making an accident.
Tom tried to tell me something, but Mary stopped him before he could say something.
There's so much I can't do until tomorrow.
I can't cancel it.
Can you see the stars tonight?
You're an hour.
The moon was a place and sky.
She's like a queen.
We only have one chance.
He kept his face like he didn't hurt.
The current government has many problems.
Tom disappeared last night.
I don't feel like he's gonna help me.
You'll face it.
You must like Tom very much.
They're always complaining.
You need to read between the lines.
I enjoyed it.
Tom's taking over the news.
In those days I was a baby.
Tom can't come to the meeting.
I'd like another coffee.
You're fucked up.
That sounds complicated.
She gave me a lot of meaning.
I went through the car corridors to find a place.
How do you eat it?
I don't have clothes.
I thought about it.
The drive's starting to break.
I woke up to find a bird in the room.
Tom must have been curious.
We kept talking.
The fugitives in this city are bad.
I'm ready to follow you.
No doubt I don't regret it.
My mom made me a doctor.
Can I have a moment for you?
I'm not going to Santa.
Tom's been holding up.
It doesn't look like anyone's telling the truth.
Usually I'm going to school by foot.
What do you want to rest, ice cream or three?
Please give me a seven show card.
How did you convince Tom to do this?
Why is she so drunk?
All of you behaved the same way.
I got hurt.
Alex will say "colour."
Where's an emergency?
I have to go.
I'm saying a good word about you.
Tom's got his boots on.
How do you get to the station?
We just got here today.
Drinking too much milk, 'cause it's healthy.
It doesn't seem that way.
There's barely a few flowers in our garden.
I thought you were working.
Tom's accusing his client.
I met your father last night.
You're not fast, are you?
She's a quiet woman.
They want to see you dead.
Whose car is this?
Call me Taro, please.
I've been looking.
Tom likes fish.
These girls are dressed in fancy clothes.
I prefer coffee.
Good to see you all again.
This car is hers.
Tom was a spy.
Tell me why you're moving!
She pushed him into trial.
Tom hates going to school.
We're doing the best we can.
What's your real name?
He's busy up to four o'clock.
Tom's going to go to a ghost camp.
Are you speaking German?
I don't like running.
I went to Tom about the time he was praying.
Women don't love him.
I don't feel right I'm not telling her.
The police let him go.
Maybe not.
Tom's been helping me lately at the end of the week when I'm at work.
Berlin's heat fell in 1989.
If we knew what we were doing, it wasn't called research, right?
Please fill in the standby tops.
I got nine in physics.
I thought it was Rock's smoke.
All the students went to their homes.
The assumption is that she's lost her life.
Until I read the book, I didn't know anything about it.
It'll be dangerous to get close to the money.
He cut his fingers.
Can I eat my lunch here?
I think we're having a very good time.
It's useful, isn't it?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
He can speak French and English.
I asked the defense to take some trees.
I think there's a three-point sound.
Here, take my hand.
It's too big.
You need to stop playing.
We're going upstairs, so why don't you come with us?
Tom went on his own.
This minute book is mine.
She's not good enough for him.
You saw how busy they were, didn't you?
Where was she at the same time?
I can't walk into my new apartment.
Ready to show.
I have a normal vision.
I can't go any faster.
Have you ever brought your dog to the coast?
He's getting tired easily.
I'll kill Tom if I have to.
Why did Maria say that?
Any of the guys who ask?
You talked about it with Tom?
The building's in the ground noise.
When was Tom's trial?
Tom's hiding in a building going down the street.
I'm ashamed of Fleet out of the way.
I think Tom would have agreed with me.
You're late for the party.
Tom hid the book behind the back.
Our operation needs a lot of space.
There's no time to worry about it now.
Just get out of here.
Tom's boots are up.
I know Tom wants to do a good job.
I was sick.
Get on it, Tom!
They threw out his visit as a riot.
Take your homework off.
She was pretty stupid to go out with him.
The dead coffee is in the pool.
Tom, Mary and John in the kitchen.
Most of the saints are in a pool.
I've got a fever.
She's got a beautiful baby.
John sent me a letter in German.
We need to know right away.
I've got it up.
Tom was innocent.
We helped them too.
Excuse me, can I use the phone?
I care about Tom.
It's hard to breathe.
Keep a good word in your hand.
How much time do you make a shower?
It's been too long.
One day next month I'm planning on going to Quito.
When's she gonna have to go for a walk?
I'm Superintendent Eight.
Three May will know the results of the elections.
I'm doing it for you.
It may not be necessary for you to do it, but I think you need it.
This baby is a year old.
I've been on my way lately.
If you don't feel well, maybe you should stay in bed for a while.
It happened today.
You're weird.
Can you explain to me the whole thing?
Tom eats a lot of ice cream.
We're going to get it.
She's got a glass of water.
What happens when an uncomplicated memory is actually trapped?
It's gonna be a good weekend.
I couldn't control my anger.
Did you know how many of the problems you're facing today's order?
How'd you get through this?
Can you tell what it was for you for this experience?
I'm not letting you down.
I guess you're angry.
Tom doesn't know that.
Why are you learning a foreign language?
I'm going to destroy Afi.
A breath of fresh air.
He's traveling all over the world.
I wonder if Tom recorded the signal.
Tom looks a little lost.
The crowd's gone.
Mary's a nice girl.
I'm really tired, but I can't bring myself to sleep.
It hurts my head!
The chain's gonna hurt the balls.
Please don't interrupt!
Your mom'll be back on it a few times you want.
He likes dougs.
They think the Creator is hidden where he is.
Tom's suspicious.
I couldn't understand anything he said.
Tom usually swims before breakfast.
The dentist will only get you after you have a transplant.
Tom's just watching.
You have to drive normally.
I love them.
I'm looking up.
We'll take care of it ourselves.
Tom's a hero.
The idea he's making in these elections is against everything I value most.
I feel something.
Tom knows exactly how you feel.
I feel like I understand your feelings.
Tom Neal's a terrible guest of life.
Tom didn't ruin Mary.
The conversation began with friendly applause but ended with injury and injury.
She'll come too if she'll be tired.
I'm not tired anymore.
I never had a credit card.
Tom needs some sleep.
Don't worry about the problem.
He tried to trick the bird but failed.
Thank you for coming all this way.
You know I'm not rocked.
A low-food kitten.
Don't worry.
You look excited.
Your wife's still in the bar?
The car's on a search trip.
You've evaluated the situation for payments.
I was very busy writing the short story.
He kept the window closed.
You went to some concert in Germany?
It takes a lot of time.
We know?
And now what?
You guys shut up.
Dad bought me a book.
Pull the strings.
The scientist's looking for dinosaurs' bodies deep.
Tom went alone.
Everybody wants to talk to Tom.
Can you throw the ball?

The little dog had his own car.
He was injured by his left leg in an accident.
The new country could have been, on the screen, a small country.
I'm not cooking without sugar in coffee.
It's free.
Please give me a gallon of paper.
Let me see.
I think she's good in me.
I've colored up to Ken.
He always has hands in his pockets and head in his arms.
Tom stopped searching.
Isn't that good for you?
Tom's got the case in the microwave and press on the action button.
No, it's not normal.
We knew it.
Tom's pretty popular, isn't he?
He's right for the first time.
Wake up the poton, please.
I think he'll come.
I don't understand you.
We're overseers.
When I turned my back on the hill, there was an old tractor to live.
Put your weapon down!
I told him to come.
The end of the world is approaching.
What happened to your hair?
The roof was covered all over the floor.
He came home dead.
The victory turned him into a hero.
Tom's not coming back.
Who do you want to talk to?
Let's meet and have a party.
The girl put her arm on the man.
What kind of voice are you making?
How'd you get so drunk?
Mr. Wood loves Linda very much.
Last month was November, wasn't it?
Don't touch me.
Man's nature scares me.
Please call me back.
Do what Mom tells you.
Tom's plan for real work.
It won't be more than three minutes.
Tom's the best thing he's doing.
Can you hear the lights on the beach?
It was a wonderful place.
No one knows.
Have I ever told you how beautiful you are?
It won't be easy.
Tom was disturbed by Mary's silence.
Tom's got to talk a little bit weirder than all of us.
He did it for him.
I've been in my pocket.
We're going on the call.
I'd like to speak English straight.
Mrs. Satto drew her daughter to study hard.
Mary hasn't started yet.
None of my friends play golf.
Who's gonna care?
You must be some kind of proud.
It's a faster way.
He didn't resist it at all.
I'm sorry, but I can't respond right away.
You're my life.
He's hurt.
Let's get on our feet.
You're already coming?
I'll be pretty dry.
Are you worried?
I've got a lot of patience.
I need more than a distance.
I knew I was gonna win.
It's not like home.
It can be lethal.
Tom kept it warm.
Wherever he's stopped, he's got a nice face.
I didn't lose it.
You haven't had any sick days.
I'm tired.
Don't shoot!
Tom's almost never asked questions.
They're ready.
You're leaving.
I think I just heard someone.
It's amazing.
You better eat breakfast.
Your watch is similar to mine in a way and color.
Ken's about the same answer as Bill.
That's why we let you go.
"Goliber Travels" was written by a famous English superman.
Leave the room.
I thought it was a good book, but Jim thought another one.
Your letter just came to me last night.
I don't think it's funny!
It's my house, not yours.
We saved her.
It's not a mistake.
All life on the face of the earth is a bit of a mess.
A rain down?
Oh, my God!
Tom is with the car.
Tom's coming and coming.
I'm talking about you.
It feels great.
Where are you living?
Tom's being treated.
She shot the house.
Can you fix it?
Close the gate.
You're pregnant.
Hold on there, Tom.
Is history really coming back on itself?
It's all covered in a blanket.
Where's your cabinet?
He fell by the throat and told him an accident.
Do you have any idea how dangerous this is?
I'm going out to Tokyo tomorrow.
The Julian ship was in the Brazilian army.
I'm London.
They mentioned your name.
They say he's very hot.
It's all gone.
Just so you know, I'm an FBI agent.
Where'd all the war go?
You should read between the lines.
I couldn't do that.
You're gone.
Why are people scared of you?
Hit the tree!
Tom's not the only one here.
Spirit flowers.
Where's your hat?
Are you home?
The plan was a computer game of hatred.
Why would anyone suffer so much?
Now I'll take you in hand.
You've saved everything you've got so far.
There's a bullet through the window.
I was great.

The horse is away from home.
You think you're suffering from weight loss?
Her mother brought her to the place where she was today.
He's been late, usually.
Tom's in Boston.
There's a little hope.
They got married and stuck your trust in Boston.
Your room's dirty.

I hope he'll come.
You're leaving.
I'm going to start.
Today we're going to launch the subjunctive line in English.
All the people who were here went.
I don't know where she went.
You're not leaving, are you?
I want some of this stuff.
I'm Descarty.
I'm missing a gag.
Did you hear what I said?
To learn how to communicate effectively is worth the time.
I didn't attack anyone.
Through the window I see a river.
I'm very good at what I'm stuck in.
The rest of us are ready.
Can you see them?
There's a store.
Keep it on the outside closet.
Take it out.
You have to hurry, or you'll have to cross the fast bus.
He needs a back.
How do I get out of the river?
I think it was pretty nice.

Enjoy the party until you're part of it.
Breakfast was great.
I've kept Tom.
She's a musician in blood.
Are you sure you want to know the truth?
Tom didn't know Mary's family name.
I'm not trying to get out of the deal.
I hope you shut down the bill properly.
His father was a cop.
I have much more to learn.
Tom's losing his mind easily.
Actually, that idea isn't even bad.
Do you feel like she could present our report in English?
The math is the most beautiful and most amazing creation of the human soul.
I didn't enter the details.
Two-way school missing.
I want a milk liter.
Your opinion is too optimistic.
The rain prevents the pressure from disappearing.
Please don't bother us.
I don't have any enemies.
Since Mario lied to me, I haven't lied to him.
Tom and Mary are just talking to their kids.
If you're lucky, you can make contact with a close family, which will be more effective in researching your family's births than you'll ever be able to.
Is it okay if I make a quick shower?
I spent hours reading books.
He sent me a letter, and where he asked if the book came to me.
Can you come back next week?
Can I join you at the table?
Everyone thinks so.
How do I get one of these?
It won't be the same without you.
Has anyone talked to you?
Maybe I'll go down last night.
I never thought it would make it.
She's a tough girl.
I want to get ready.
There's someone who's the first one I'd like to talk to.
You don't answer my question.
Can you give me a hand?
Since she wasn't a truck, I had to go home by foot.
She's been reading you too many days for a while.
Just Obama knows it.
You're sending him?
These pranks are bad.
That's what's been done for 20 percent.
Let's ask Tom why else.
True friends won't get in trouble.
We've lost everything you feel.
Take it home.
Tom knew that Mary wanted him to invite her out.
I'm not so confused.
He's working very hard.
Good job!
I mean, he's just a liar.
You need to be free.
I was hoping you learned something.
Tom knows much better than I do.
It doesn't seem to sit down.
I loved it.
He won't.
At the end of the call, she's back on the word.
I like flowers like apples and apples.
Don't worry that birds in dogs will get water and eat too much.
Three times four is twelve.
How did you find out Tom didn't break his accounts?
Why are you afraid of me?
He's got a new ear.
Where are we going to eat?
What year were you born?
He's well controlled in English.
I can't see who it is.
You're ready to read my boyfriend and fix the appointments, if you're asleep?
I couldn't bear to see you leave.
I love them.
Too much fun.
It wasn't clear if they ended it, if it was.
It's a tamax tape.
Tom's on the couch and tomorrow.
Nothing's going on.
I don't want to go into the bathroom.
Is it hurt?
These working trees have different branches.
Can I get you a drink?
I'm in the back.
You're not bothering me.
We like Tom at least like you.
It's very special.
You should've listened to me.
Let's write a book.
I'm in a store.
Let's not waste our time.
You're happy to argue that this trial is a long way off, aren't you?
That's not true.
On the one hand, there are reasonable points of view.
Tom took his load.
Tom ran down the street.
Looks like he doesn't know how to laugh.
Is this chair open?
I'm not making your shoes.

She sounds embarrassed.
He was dressed up.
Your attitude is right, less or more.
Dad came to his office in time.
Let's go back to what happened the day Tom went to his world.

Try to see things like they really are.
We're missing a shot.
Milk's crazy.

No one likes war.
I'm gay.
Tom believes that Mary killed John.
The swimming machine is a great find.
You really think about Tom's good?

He's lost our dearest son.
I'd like to know, too.
We're getting used to it.
That's exactly what it's about.
That's ridiculous.
Tom can't get your gift.
Tom's gone crazy.
Can you stop doing this?
Ask Alex.
Mickey Conners did some maribo cuts in a mirror.
I'm writing a series.
I guess I should've done more.
You don't have to do anything you want to learn.
Take this aspirin.
You don't want to know!
I felt like I needed to talk to someone.
There's something I want.
Can you get there in the process?
Let's move the gear.
I'm real.
I thought he was a real man.
You have to answer the question.
Check it out.
We're eating here all the time.
Answer me.

I want you to sit here and enjoy yourself.
Archiving isn't stealing.
Didn't you see my cat?
It's the worst day of my life.
I wonder why Tom didn't do it.

It sounds like him.
It's just her.
Do you have sedines?
He's talking like a fish.
You can't underestimate the importance of your choice of friends.
Young smoke's on.
Don't think it's the best way.

The sun is at the center of the solar system.
Tom came behind me and needed his weapons around me.
I told you to love Tom.
I like to eat Sushi.
Stop it, Tom.

I'm glad someone told me.
Let's just get out of here.
The last month was very full.
Take as much as you want.
City Tom now.
What's so special about this, Tom?
You're in danger here.
The damage has a devastating effect on the ecology of the area.
Why would you suspect me?
We don't want to.
They look okay.
It was all for me when I first visited Spain.

Leave me alone!
Can you see the invisible man?
It was very cold.
I have to get it back tonight.
You're being honored.
He's probably kicking Shakespeare up next time.
You're weird.
Tom needs to buy himself some time.
Why doesn't he love me anymore?
It'll be clear over time.
Tom was on the beach.
Tom said he was coming back.
You want me to blame Lake on your birds?
I don't think that's a good idea.
I'll start.
Tom lives far away from here.
I'll never see him.
I know you're more open to these matters.
