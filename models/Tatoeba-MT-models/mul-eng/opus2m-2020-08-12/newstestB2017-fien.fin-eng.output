At the age of 28, coke was found dead from the sanfranciscola shopping center
Recently, a 28-year-old change in San Francisco was found dead from the local shopping center this week.
The victim's brother says that he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had recently got his thing to order."
The body found at Westfield's shopping center on Wednesday morning was declared to be 28-year-old San Francisco, and is informed of San Francisco's legal authority.
According to the San Francisco police station, death is a personal matter.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told the TV company of ABC in San Francisco that the former cook Frank worked in Boston had found his dream when he was rescued from San Francisco Sons & Dawthers' kitchen master six months ago.
The representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said death was a cause for all of them.
"We are a small and tight team like a family, our evil is great," said the representative.
"Our idea is for Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells Frank's first place in the hostels, but last night he got his business arranged.
"He found a apartment, and he had a girlfriend," said Louis Galicia to KGO.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and grew up.
His way of being together with his family was to prepare food for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to argue with anyone.
He was a brother who walked along the line.
Despite all the mistakes that have happened in the world, he was an immeasurable mystery that broke out every day," he says.
In all cases, you are asked to call the San Francisco police station for a guide number 415-575-4444.
Leaking junior doctors require new jobs
The representatives of British Junior Doctors (who are nearly qualified doctors in Finland) have brought their professional associations and have asked for permission in the debate on a new employment agreement.
The Youth Medical Committee (JDC) representing the British Medical Association (BMA) has been calling for support from the beginning of September to be provided by its Government.
According to JDC, ministers have not resolved problems with the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students fought with BMA in July in a vote.
58% of the members involved in the vote voted against the agreement.
The President of the Junior Medical Committee, Ellen McCourt, would write a letter to members of JDC on Thursday evening on behalf of the JDC in which he speaks of the Government's "own-initiative" issues leading to the fight against the treaty.
The letter reads: "In this light, the JDC Government has voted in favour of the whole new Treaty proposal and requires new formal negotiations on all of our concerns.
In response to the difficult situation of the JDC government today, the Government of BMA has submitted an official request to the Government of BMA asking for permission from the beginning of September to the extent that it has been able to allow for a growing number of jobs."
As a result of this crisis, junior doctors have been in prison for six times this year, which included the first complete changes in working conditions in the history of the British public health system.
Following the vote, BMA Prime Minister Johann Malwana resigned from his position after the vote because he did not accept the agreed agreements recommended by BMA.
Malavana told BMA members at the previous meetings that the agreement was good and that it should be accepted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would come into force and it would apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: Foreign Union?
It was a curse that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met in silence to deal with the agreement and to send for an official decision of eight months' term and economic package.
However, when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish official stand against Peter’s return to the golden islands, it became clear that he had a greater desire for reconciliation in Ankara.
Yes, the parties received,
But Putin's smile seemed to look thin, and he didn't even get hot with his own stick.
In contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke again of Mr Putin's "good friend" – according to one report five times.
I didn't stand on my own.
In addition, he promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, one of our country’s speakers wrote about Erdogan’s behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I've just figured out his motive.
But the continued delay of Putin's photo showed that the head of Russia has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian war machine at the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the event-time was quite a shock.
I said exactly what you're going to say to Ankara, and it was a clear accusation of rape.
It was even bigger because it became an unlikely friend.
It must be difficult to regain real trust, perhaps even impossible.
The general opinion of the people of Russia has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media have been engaged in a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious were the accusations of top officials, according to which Erdogan’s family has benefited from the unsaturated oil trade of Isis in Syria.
Erdogan has rejected the charges with great weight.
However, the official message received from Peter was that it is time to move forward.
Finally, this meeting was organised only in order for Putin to receive his request for an apology from President Erdogan.
Thus Russia may have gained some sort of victory.
The benefits of advertising a weapon to an enemy are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after nearly a month’s imprisonment in a state-of-the-art coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly treated him as well.
The interest also has an economic impact.
Russia's taxes have been lifted in Turkey, particularly the charter ban, as it normally travels several million Russian tourists a year to the coast of Turkey.
The number has fallen by nearly 90 percent.
What will happen to Russia, travel planners and charter companies will certainly come to worry about the relief when air traffic can finally continue.
They put their faith in a later war on the Mediterranean.
And this week, public television has predicted the low price of fruit and vegetables when Turkey's agricultural products are again allowed to be imported.
"Tourists there, Tomatoes back here," was formed in the Vedemost article.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the west because it thinks that the west has gradually responded to the government aid company.
In spite of the old beautiful progress in the future of Turkey's EU membership negotiations and the lack of Putin, a youth who is eager to take advantage of the gap between Turkey's borders and to strengthen Turkey's ties to the west.
Russia’s leader undoubtedly won the bonus points in Ankara when it expressed its support to the elected authorities after the state aid company.
This was obvious to Moscow itself, which has endured its care for the exchange of power.
As a result, Russia and Turkey were able to take a look at the seabed at the prairie palace, which one analyst described as "external alliance": two countries that experience their coming to the west reject and encounter such a force.
Despite the public interest, these two still have great differences.
It is important that Syria, where Moscow has created itself to portray itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It is very much said that almost three hours after the initial negotiations, both Presidents told the press that they had not dealt with the subject at all.
The President of Turkey refused to give an answer to the question of the differences between the countries, while Putin insisted on them.
There is no clear unity between the countries where they could try to reach a common understanding in Syria.
Taking into account the possibility of a complete disaster caused by the Turkish Member of NATO under attack by a Russian war machine, it is no doubt better that these two heads of state are still speaking after the opening of the months.
Royal Bank of Scotland loses its customers outside Scotland
According to the head of the RBS Bank, the bank’s operation outside Scotland is determined by its continuing supply of business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland loses its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the public radio company BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was initially linked to the global targets of the bank.
The bank had to go back to its objectives when it collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
At the time, branding strategies have been used by RBS to protect other consumer funding barriers.
It sponsored millions of red international sports, such as Six Nations -rugby and Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now the future has been viewed as the right thing to save more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland should remain in use by Scottish customers, but it will not be used as a short RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWestei, including the main account and the stamp.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Irish Republic and in Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that come to gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwana was challenged during a presentation to customers and staff at Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "RBS is becoming an investment brand and therefore, as our staff is in service, we are now making much more money into a bank of different brands.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff works with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced its final sponsorship of Six Nations -rugby and it has raised different brand profiles in the sponsorship.
"It is now the right time to move different brands into the bank because the fundamental issue is how we can make the bank better customers," says the bank's head.
"Three years ago it would have been very embarrassing if we had said that we would be a great bank to our customers and took fire.
But our work and focusing on the needs of our customers has changed much rather than our own needs.
We can bring those brands back again, so I think it's time."
Frankie Detor successfully won in Newmarket at Predelection and won 3,000.
After two fights in Newmarket, the Detor won the 3,000 winnings.
Jockey Frankie Dettor guaranteed his 3,000 winnings in the British Championships in Newmarket on Friday.
On this summer flight, he achieved his flight through Predillection twice the same night on his own local team. Predillection is John Gosden's trained horse.
The Italian Detor, 45, is six jocky which achieves this windshield in the competitions of this fair.
He's been rescued by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddy and Willie Carson.
The three-fold masteriockey Detor, who previously won in Ghyyyar, says: "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because it ended right here 30 years ago.
It's not a big competition event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a completely normal holiday and a 20 000-person general.
I'm relieved and I feel great humility."
The Detor will resist the attacks with the Predillection after his victory
Two jockeys have reached the windshield in the stairwell competitions, and they're masterieckey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time Master Sir Anthony McCoy, who won a preliminary round of over 4,300 times.
Lester Piggott, 9th Derby winner, 4 493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jocks of this time, and it is not surprising that he has just reached this springboard where only recently he has arrived.
He's nice and strong, but his tactical progress is what separates him from his memory.
He's a fantastic representative of the competition, his enthusiasm and his passion have brought some supporters over the years."
"I told France a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won 6,000 cash if he had just competed for a week and only in big money!
In serious terms, Frank's voyage to the Ison-British coast has been a success for nearly 30 years, which has been very powerful to follow.
He's a living person, which is good for British competition, but first of all he's an incredible jocky."
Frankie Dettori came to his senses in a way that recognized him by lifting his horse from his horse.
"Flying ground income to low-income airlines, Frankie Dettor has been a model of British competition for over two decades.
The road's been flooded by overland and sub-areas.
He has won numerous major battles, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but he has also experienced air accidents and has been in competition for drug abuse.
When the competition turned out three years ago, he had started having difficulty starting, but he showed amazing comfort in nature, appeared to doubters and returned to the best.
And she's not yet in her early teens to end her career – Dettor has recently said she wants to continue the competition for at least 50 years."
Putin was separated by Sergei Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin went out to surprise his head of government, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted internal border for many years.
Ivanov, 63 was now appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
According to Kremlin, President Putin "has decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian Presidential Administration", but no grounds were given for his resignation.
Mr Vaino has been appointed Vice-President of Ivanov since 2012.
Vaino, 44, is an old diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Vaino was produced by an estimated Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he led the president's department of minutes and the government's people, telling the Russian-language website of Kremlin.
The woman thanked Putin for his name, saying: "I am grateful for your trust.
I think that the most important task of the administration is to support your work as Head of State, which means to make legislative acts and to monitor how your instructions are implemented."
Putin told the Russian television company last Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for a divorce and recommended Vainoa for his next visit.
Are smiles real?
This move has led to a surprise in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has been part of Vladimir Putin's neighborhood for a long time, and Putin's way also has a KGB history.
As a governing overseer, he was one of the most influential men in the world.
At a TV show in Russia, President Putin and both said of his own request for Ivanov's mission.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations are only rare, especially under parliamentary circumstances.
Are they a result of some kind of government?
No one knows yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that the President-in-Office would like to take the lead in Russia's environmental policy as soon as possible.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "It is his place that I asked you to give me this very many and to some extent for four years to work on the project.
I have now served as President's management overseer for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
That's before he serves as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and Putin State Security Service of the former KGB.
When Putin acted as head of the KGB Security Service (FSB) at the end of the 1990s, Ivanov was appointed to his financial office.
At the end of the day, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
In time, it was thought that Ivanov would be able to come to the Russian President after Putin's second term because the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected within the third term.
However, I had to go to the other Putin's neighborhood, Dmitri Medvedeville.
From the moment he became Prime Minister, after which he returned to the president only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds – FBI researchers star Thomas Gibson got shot at his producer
Gibson was involved in a violent robbery in Los Angeles last month.
The series produced by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios told the foolish in their shared knowledge.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, known as Gibson, had filed an apology file before being informed of his expulsion.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry it went like this," she says when she knows.
Information on how Gibson's campaign is written out of the next line by FBI agents, will be published later, and will be reported in the information provided by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios companies.
Previously on the comedy series Dharma & Greg, 54-year-old Gibson has been involved in the series of its first production routes since 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I've put my heart and soul in it for the last two years," says Gibson in his release.
"I hope I see the end of the line, but it's no longer possible.
I would like to thank all the authors, producers, exhibitors, our great producer group and most importantly: the best fans that could ever have hoped."
The 12th edition of the series shall be held in the United States on 28 September.
Secret dating of fish to the Banffilian tree
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banffi, has asked for help in identifying the fish that he has grown up in his garden.
There is no doubt about these 75 fish windmills, which have become the world's largest railway station.
The Bay, located 500 metres from the seabed, would publish a photo material in Periscope and hope to receive a response to the emergence of these scientific fish.
Queensferry's superiors are now connected to Fifeen
An estimated 1.35 billion red projects are now being prepared by May 2017.
Engineers have joined Queensferry's northern plan and landscape, which means that it is now connected to Fifee.
It's the first of the four parts between "cansills" which are now almost ready for the trip around the three wings.
Fifesta is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 wines.
An estimated 1.35 billion red projects are now being prepared by May 2017.
The Minister of Finance Keith Brown visited the country today and was one of the first to travel from the country to that country.
Brown says: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry's superstructure.
We are all witnessing a truly significant progress in the construction of the bridge, and we are afraid of building this fortress with over 30,000 concretes and steel.
In spite of the massive composition and pressure, the construction of the bridge between the ground and the bridge is a wonderful operation requiring precise installation facilities.
There are now almost 79% of the total number of deaths in the country, and since the final part is being reached in Russia today, which means that the country is ready to move to the place."
The head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, Michael Martin, says: "The preparation of the first seal is always important in all the projects of the seal.
In this fantastic project, this part represents the top of the road and water building.
When the last part of the roof was installed and attached to the North Tower wall, then we had to close behind the remaining north (i.e. the ground floor) temple.
This was done by crossing the north side of the land 700 miles [700 km] south.
This was a massive operation and at the same time a great precision required.
Massive because of its length of 222 metres and its pressure of some 6,000 tonnes, it was to be carried up by about 3 per cent in the temperature.
And great accuracy is required because the tolerances to be followed were very small – just a few millimeters.
Everything went well."
Moelfre Bay Rescuer tells three men about the rescue
Angelesey, representing the three men who had taken possession of the water from their fishing boats, survived as a miracle trade.
Moelfre RNLI's maritime rescue site made a wake-up call at 13.20 p.m. on the ground floor of the man's accident at Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to take refuge in the same way as their vehicle continued unattended walking without a driver.
"We saw a direct turn of the boat on their side and imagined the worst," says the rescue water of Moelfren, Time Vince Jones.
"By the time we got to the water, the strong winds had been able to drive the boat back from them."
The local fishing river saved two men, again at the age of 60 at the age of 60, and was found dead as a boy and without a lifeboat.
All of them were taken to the coastal rescue boat and transported to the rescue site.
Vince Jones says, "I'm amazed that these three men who need to keep their water are still alive and fully well.
There was an emergency alarm in the vehicle, but it was for some reason that it separated from the old man in connection with the crash.
They really had me on a trip."
Pokémon Go's director of that health and happiness
It's hard to watch how the world changes.
Over the last decade, many have wondered why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but they prefer to go inside and dig their wheels.
Pokémon Go allows people to get up and move.
At the beginning of the lunch period, only TV watched, and then video games and latest smartphones came.
It must be noted, then, that technology and the outside world do not close each other.
This is of course referred to as the Pokémon Go. Pokémon Go is a playhouse whose tastes are based on video games created in the 1990s (which were later also made by cross-sections, games cards and other hand products).
Like many popular cultural sciences, this also ended a little before the new game arrived in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
In other countries, the launch was delayed because of a strong interest in which services were overloaded.
In just a few days, the Pokémon Go game ended with Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
So how does the game work?
Short-listed players go out looking for pokemons that are followed by GPS. When the pokemo is found, it can be "photo" (by phone display) or "catch".
Vilitity is the most popular video game in the game as a young player of the generation and raised the back of the ball.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of actions "a medium person" takes on a daily basis.
Washington Post recently reported on the Apple Watch Cardiogram application, which was found within two days of the game's launch, that the number of traffic in 30 minutes per day rose immediately to 45 per cent by 53 per cent. Cardiogram followed 35,000 users.
The company doesn't know who's playing the Pokémon Go game, it only sees traffic data.
Many public health campaigns in which people are encouraged to get up early and move for at least 30 minutes a day have all been on the corners of the streets because the campaigns have been quiet and their reputations have appeared to be disastrous.
However, the importance of the movement does not need to be limited.
Regular mobility is less likely to result from foodborne disease or undermining.
The movement helps to control stress, reduce blood pressure, prevent diabetes and increase the other benefits.
The beauty of the Pokémon Go game is that it can make people out to do something they enjoyed.
In this way, three basic factors that support health — movement, wind and the sun and joy are achieved.
It's possible to get even new friends during the race.
As usual, this is also the sad times of happiness.
And yes, someone can play on the door.
What about it?
The murder has been committed.
Because even though programs like Fitbit were already able to monitor your activity, they have not given rise to the movement as Pokémon Go does.
Renewal failure is disappearing, and use decreases over time.
However, as a result of the success of the pocémons, there will be more games where applications and virtualism are combined in a real world, which will increase the movement of people seeking and improve their culture and health.

Simone Billes made gold in the formation of women's telecoms
Forget it.
Forget about hypothetism.
Simone Billes is immune to all these things.
The dynamics of hippies.
It's not a tree. It's a tree.
You're gonna have to sign up with a pen.
That's great.
And now, finally, I'm also an Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American television powerman won a tortoise of training skills and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympics.
His total score 62.198 was clearly better than that of Aly Raisman and Russian prossimist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Billes of the United States is present in the final Torsa of the formation of women's telecoms in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The bicycle became four successive and five times the American who won the mastership of formation. Thus he strengthened his reputation as the best or even the best of all times.
Billes jumped into the canyon when his complete finish point came to the scene and his long way ended right now.
The achievement led to a completely new dimension and raised him in the same class to other superstars such as Michael Phelps:
Billes has been a very powerful species for the last three years. He has won 15 world championships, of which 10 gold, and won them with so much respectable and precise programs that in 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called him "the most powerful television power player of all times".
There was another final competition in Brazil, which was used primarily between Billes and his own and over-expected job, not even between Billes and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring in less than a cruel goldsmith would be a temptation.
The U.S. Simone Billes (left) and Aly Raisman want to win gold and win women's telecoms in the final tournament of the private competition in Rio 2016 in the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11.8.2016
Biles won the first gold medal as a point on the i and now she's staying at Martha Karolin's hotel.
Although Billes claimed that he had never thought of anything in the past long ago, it is not completely true.
Part of his permanto programme, which contains his famous voltist series as a state card, has been adapted to a Latin music that could well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympics.
It's not gonna hurt.
Her husband was already a minor adoptor and the manufacturer Aimee Boorman's mother had become a power race. Boorman found a girl when it was at the day-to-day meeting at the power plant where Boorman was prepared.
He has not lost any training competition after the summer of 2013, and the winning race will probably continue as long as Billes wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafin had reached a small lead on two circuits, it was like a relief.
There were also trees and permanent trees where Billes has to defend the world's master.
He returned to his lead at 15.433 points and his crown from the final score at 15.933 points.
Raisma kindly liked him as they waited for final points – which was just a form – and the monkeys began to appear as red, white, and blue on the border around Billes when the victim’s death was done.
Raisman’s performance was a small reflection of four years’ back competition when he first broke up the third but then destroyed the princess with the Mustafin reconnaissance.
This time, at 22 years of age, a group leader who Americans called the group "Mother" was clearly Mustafina before.
He sent airplanes to the public after his permanto programme and thus rose from the death toll as a winner, which seemed uncertain.
What will happen to Billes this 19-year-old year ago by doing and wide-ranging tweeting is now completely new:
The police tell three music in the car of a victim of a serial killer
Two 12-year-olds and one 12-year-old girl were killed in the worst band murder of Phoenix for ten years. The victims were sitting in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot, telling Torstana the police information.
According to the authorities, on 12 June, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot.
The gun stood on the side of the car, where he shot at the hand with eight shots and then picked it up with another car, which is said to be said.
The police suspect that for the reasons of the third murder there was no theft because the attacker did not bring handcuffs and no $2,900 from the government of another adult victim.
The Phoenix police officer, Jonathan Howard, told the police that he is now investigating whether death is related to a four-year-old attack.
The total of seven people have died and two have been injured in nine attacks that have occurred mainly in Latin American settlements within four months.
"The events are common that they have been attacked in residential areas at home," Howard told CBS's television and radio company earlier this month.
It is unlikely that there are several vehicles, including the Russian at the end of the 1990s, the Black BMW at the end of the 1990s and the White Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related to each other and that their authors are the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital where he later died because of his injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
The observer told the police that the three had been sitting in the car often listening to music.
In addition, the police would publish a report informing them that they had been shot in an open package only half an hour before a three-day death. The gun is believed to be the same in each case.
The researchers found holes and took from the seat of the car to the roof of the building and the motorist of the building.
The mother of a six-year-old boy who suffers from microbial disease: "It's going to change better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuta likes to sing, play, and of course her mother.
But unlike most other age groups, Edmund has a microcephalus, which is the birth date of his mother Elizabeth Picciuto's genetic disorder, which he was not pregnant with while he was aware of.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I wouldn't find out about this.
I can't figure this out.
I didn't make a commitment to this.
Which is not true at all, of course you're committed to it," she says.
Elizabeth and her husband were told to Vincent that Edmund might never know them and that he might never survive.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child should be placed in a hospital.
"Essiraction was that I didn't believe in such practice anymore," says Picciuta.
Edmund's on his way to the roleplayer.
Edmund got up to sit down and started talking at the age of three, and he's not talking yet.
But he's slowly going ahead of his own will.
He's walking as an assistant and driving a drill.
He was playing with his two brothers and he loved singing.
Elizabeth introduces Edmund's search for a clue that he means "sing me."
"Let's teach him a language of non-violence," Piccito told CBS News.
However, it does not only mean a common reference language, but it also includes references to Edmond himself.
There may be a number of different diseases behind the microbefaly: hereditary diseases such as Edmund’s case, or chronic viral infections such as tuberculosis or zikavirus.
There's a big difference between the symptoms and the predictions.
There is still too much time to evaluate how it affects the lives of people with diabetes.
Picciuta reminds us of the uncertainty of the future.
"As we continue: how we go,
How are we going?"
And he doesn't know yet.
"I've never been asked to predict, because I don't think anyone can give it."
But Picciutou has the hope of giving advice to mothers whose children have birth defects caused by Zikavirus.
"It's getting better.
There's a way to get organized.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Banks and related rescue operations in the countries of Louisiana and Mississippi
The government of Louisiana announced on Friday that it was due to the arrival of bankers and large-scale distributors. More ports are still expected to be available on Sunday.
According to national law, many of the people who have come across the islands of the Caucasus and South Mississippi and are spreading across the region as a result of powerful banking facilities.
The Government of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, says that the authorities of the country are still in contact with local authorities and that aid is already on the way to the coming areas.
Information from the government's government security and emergency department, Mike Steele, informs the Office of requests for arrival vehicles, Russian and Pacific.
According to Steele, only the Tangibaho region has requested tens of thousands of cookies.
The future warning shall remain in force until the day of the day in most of South-Louisiana.
According to the information provided by the regulatory authority, the water may be added to the region from 76 to 127 mm.
In southern Alabama there was a warning of the arrival on Friday when the ports continued on the Mobil.
During the weekend of the Committee near Baton Rougea and Amite Joon Denham Springs, both of which are in Louisiana, are predicted to be rising forecast increases.
According to engineer Alek Krautmann, many of the houses that are located on the property may have to come down to Baton Rougen's capital.
In addition, he says that arriving on the coast of Ascension poses a threat because arriving at Lake Maurepas.
In the city of Liverpool of Louisiana, the Tickfaw, which is located right south of the Mississippi state, was at nine o’clock in the afternoon.
The rescue operations continued in Amita and Wilkinson County, Lounais-Missisi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife, and his son - in - law, had been near Glostery's rescue team earlier this evening.
Hansford, 62, says that Beaver Creek, who is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose early at night.
A second boy in the neighborhood had warned him.
"We got up, and the water came on for dinner," Hansford says.
"It went up to my dinner."
The mother had told Hansford that she had never seen a river rise so high during the 48 years she's lived in the countryside.
Hansford says that he has himself and his family are all wrong, and he's the only one who's weird about them.
The rescue workers had saved all three of them by a great military river and had brought them back to Gloster, where they were supposed to protect during the spring.
Engineer Krautmann says that the arrivals will be spread quickly as the bank accounts continue, and the authorities are already considering evacuation rules.
He tells of the information received from an eyewitness near Livingstone, which he said was located about 350 mm between midnight and spring.
Krautmann says that the earthquake hit the ground powerfully after the beginnings in the middle of the week.
The authorities state that because of the arrival of the bank and the roofs, residents of the Tangapaho region had to be rescued from their homes and schools had to be evacuated in five schools.
A member of the Tanakho city administration had been told by CBS's television and radio company to WWL's subsidiary that there were 200 homes below.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but now the coming has moved them together.
The head of the regional community, Robby Miller, tells the authorities to save 72 people and seven pets who were left in jail.
The shelters for the Evacuados have been opened in the cities of Amiten and Hammond.
"They'll be able to return to their homes when the water starts to melt," she says.
In the city of Hammond in Tangapaho region, about twenty floors were to be closed because of the arrival, and residents were offered modest seats where they could try to prevent access to their homes and businesses.
"The last time we arrived in March, we received a great deal of money," says Mr. Lacy Landrum of the City Management Board.
"This coming will affect the answer."
In Mississippi, ports continued to be at the border of Mexico City, told the rescue director of Harrison's district, Rupert Lacy.
Lacy tells us that the Torstena was reported to be coming down from the roof of the house, but in the afternoon there was no one else.
The chief of the Shopr Value Foods, Keith Townson, has been telling his apartment on the Amite farm for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, and I've seen more than a hundred times."
Several creditors who have received their body at the age of 6 Mahaj Brown are experiencing an accident in Philadelphia.
According to the police, Philadelphia has been shot by a six-year-old boy who is already another six-year-old who has been shot in the city this week.
The parents of her child told CBS Philadelphia, a son of Mahaj Brown.
According to the older men, the son had several shots in his neck, neck, arm and shoulder, but he was unconscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many pieces, his small body was full of trust," said the son's grandmother Delores Mendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is true."
The boy is in a critical condition in the hospital, and he has several seizures.
The family tells the TV company that the boy believes he's alive.
He was starting the first class on the local sub-level.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.
There were also two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
The second 29-year-old situation was reported to be critical and two other conditions were stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found on the front of the car by 29 years of age in crisis.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating now if another of the wounded men could have been shot.
The police researchers told CBS Philadelphia that there was a large number of armed men in this case.
The event site was full of types of fungi, which are very different from the different types of fungi.
"I am quite clear that there was a war in progress.
On the road, there was a ladder to walk on both sides of the road.
There have been several armed fighters at the scene, and they have been actively involved in the shooting," Commissioner of the Philadelphia Police, Anthony Ginaldi told his television station.
The creations also became part of many of the houses and vehicles in the region.
No arrests have been made, and I hear the police go through surveillance videos.
The second victim of a murder in the city this week was a six-year-old girl with a hand in her play in her home in the West Oak Lane town.
The girl's in the meeting, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurieta?
This is what I call the Olympics of women's telecoms, and this is why more than one.
First of all, I have been in every summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been as powerful as it is now.
Secondly, the three executives of this group, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have attracted many colorful girls.
The group's meeting, which complements the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everything proud.
The team's representing America last night.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin-American women in a variety of ways.
In the last four years, the best female fighter in Africa has been an American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were on pages 1 and 2.
This is great.
In the past Olympics, Gabby Douglas grew up to be an amazing killer of monkeys, and the whole America ran away.
Now the world has been able to testify to the incredible achievements of the three-time world Masters Simone Billes, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez and the amazing and masterly telecom programmes.
Simone came from Torstana with four remaining Americans who won gold in the form of a personal contest.
Because of the teammate Aly Raisman, he was able to jump.
The sights are of this kind on the horizon, but they do not appear to be a large part of the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same pattern as Aly and Madison to form the Olympics.
They are the last five "Final Five", because in the next Olympic season there will be only four players, and this is Martha Karolin's last year as a waitress.
However, the reality is that telecom is an expensive exercise for athletes and drivers in the private television series that sustain their parents. The costs of exercise, facilities, trips, exhibitions, competitions, hotel fees (for manufacturers, drivers and family members) are to be paid by the parents.
Most mobile power stations are located in remote residential areas that can support the operation.
The teaching of telecoms is carried out here, and it means a warm and long-term commitment to the families of powermakers.
Simone Biles' maker Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez's maker Maggie Haney have both been preparing sort of fans since they started television.
We need to organize a more successful and better available telecom training for the countless young girls whose motivations have been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my own telecom agency 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harlem have offered an open or favourable opportunity for the protection of telecoms (mostly black and Latin American) to more than 15 000 young people (mostly black and Latin Americans), and some of these young people have been attracted to national and international teachers.
In September we are expanding our activities to my hometown of Detroit so that we can offer high-quality telecom services to young people who are able to learn and benefit from this wonderful Olympics.
The telecomping process develops energy, sleep and body coordination and teaches hard work, which is both efficient and precise.
This combination brings lifelong benefits and supports good health and success in school and work life.
This group has awakened the excitement of thousands of young girls who now want to start a telecom campaign, and it is very powerful.
Participation in some sports players is very important, especially for girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girl strength" you showed when you won the Olympics, and that you motivated so many young girls from behind to start their way as good, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors fought Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepared new laws
The ministers hoped that they would decide to make rapid changes to pay and work conditions by adopting a professional association of doctors representing the revised agreement with the British Medical Association, but 58% of the doctors involved in the vote, namely a special physician, were fighting the proposal.
In July, Minister Hunt told us about the plan to get a contract in force and said that Britain's public health system (NHS) is "no one on Earth" and that all additional precautions are harmful to individuals and patients.
The first junior doctors are moving to a new agreement that includes changes to night and weekends to improve health care in informal times.
The President of the BMA's Junior Doctoral Committee, Ellen McCourt, delivered yesterday's opinion, saying: "The young doctors are still very cautious about the proposed agreement, especially the fear that it will speed up the current labour crisis and that it will not deal with all doctors correctly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the threshold of the new agreement, so now we have to move forward, as time is running out.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has dealt with the debate companies voluntarily and in no way reacting to it.
In spite of this, Jeremy Hunt gave the last month's promise that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt is now to be delivered, the implementation of the contract is to be terminated and the care of junior doctors is to be taken into account.
If this does not happen, junior doctors are ready for new employment measures."
At the end of April, almost 13,000 routine measures were launched and 100,000 times received when doctors and consultants were asked to support lactating doctors for lactating.
The ministers hoped that they would make a decisive decision on the changes they had made by concluding an updated agreement with the professionals of the professional union representing British doctors.
The BMA will want a better week's salary for 54 000 junior doctors, which the agreement would cover.
Daniel Mortimer, head of the NGO staff, told junior doctors that they would not resort to new laws.
Mortimer says: "Working is achieved by very little or nothing, but they create stress for the teams and services already operating on their own, causing anxiety, anxiety and stress to the patients, the treatment staff and their families.
We have been negotiating with the Junior Medical Committee for the past two months, and together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have had a positive attitude towards their oversight and disclosure of their concerns.
It was hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, retraining, training costs, the central recognition of the educational programme, education and gender wage treatment - would be a sign of how serious workers, health education England and the Ministry of Health would like to take into account the agreements concluded with the BMA in March, February and May."
Day no. 2,40 € may reduce the risk of heart attack
Dental heart disease patients are receiving about €2.40 a paid medicine on the day of their treatment, when the authorities recommended that it be given to more people and longer-term use.
The use of tekagrelor reduces the risk of new heart conditions in heart patients.
This medicine is already given 12 months after heart attack which reduces the risk of stroke or new heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence of the British Public Health System (NHS) has indicated that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to increase the risk of heart and blood problems.
However, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, which is now part of the British Public Health System (NHS), has now indicated that tekagreluria should be given to patients for four years to increase the risk of heart and blood problems.
In England each year about 140,000 people whose heart rate is renewed or have brain damage.
As a result of heart attacks and strokes, the blood vessels have a fatty substance that causes plaques.
If the tablet is rediscovered, it may cause a blood clot that prevents the flow of blood into the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if a blood clot emerges, it can travel along the blood stream and prevent the flow of blood into the brains where the result is brain failure.
The risk of a new encounter is higher in people who have received multiple heart attacks.
The British AstraZenecan to produce tikagrelol, sold by Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the risk of lead.
Today’s NICE Guide recommends that tikagrelone be given for a period of up to 90 mg 12 months, after which the dose is reduced to 60 milligrams and that aspirin is given twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson of the Centre for Treatment Assessment (NICE) says: "Even though there are effective methods to prevent the progression of disease and the occurrence of symptoms, even four quarters of those with a heart attack are often the result of a new experience or brain surgery – often with immediate results.
The fear of reform can have a very negative effect on a person’s quality of life.
We have been shown that the combination of tekagrelol to aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart conditions and brain damage in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for temporary use of tekagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Since data on the efficacy and safety of tekagrelorin, in particular with regard to the risk of bleeding, are limited if it is used for more than three years, guidance does not recommend the use of the treatment method longer.
The political correctness of the atmosphere in the Muslim areas led to the fall of more vote
The former President of the Tower of Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was separated from his last year because of corruption, as a result of the government's failure
The climate of political correctness led to a wide-ranging closure of the eyes in the select Muslim communities, revealing today the role of the government.
Former Minister of Administration Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticised police, electoral and municipal authorities for having turned their eyes away from the election "on account of racial and religious overcrowding".
According to the former regional government minister and the current anti-corruption group known as Pickles, fear of religious reasons was so bad that the police should have allowed the formation of alerts outside the voting facilities so that the feared voters could be protected.
He suggests that voters should present a personal certificate in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At this moment, the voter will only have to tell his name and address.
In addition, the motion for a resolution is proposed for the removal of wires without any reference to black after the vote so that no one can vote twice.
The publishers should protect more, says Sir Eric.
It requires that suppliers be able to improve access to State Council documents and decisions of non-governmental organizations and working groups.
"The fight against corruption and corruption in the economy is more widespread in local government," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a hearing after the vote on the Canal of the Tower of Hamlet.
In the past year, the Special Court has ruled that President Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office because of corruption and numerous anti-legislative procedures.
The Court considered that Rahma 'was sincerely concerned about the religious identity of her Muslim community and her spirituality by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamic resistance.
The people were said to "use their campaign as a basis for the religious duty of every believer to vote for him".
Of the 300 voices, there were either questionnaires or were given in a random way by the voice of someone else.
According to Sir Eric, the show on the wall was received from all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at the positive situation in which members of the Muslim community were told to force people to vote on their election.
Sir Eric (shown in the picture) made several proposals to implement the voting system, including the requirement for a personal certificate at the voting site.
The report says: "It is shown that members of some ethnic minority groups in a vulnerable position, especially women and young people, have been forced to vote in accordance with the wishes of the older members, particularly in the Pakistan and Bangladesh communities."
"I was concerned that... the State institutions had turned their eyes to this kind of activity because of the "political correction" of ethnicity and religious superiority."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals for which the system could be broken, including the refusal of political activists to deal with post- polls, in order to prevent the "voting" of voices.
At the latest, further checks are also required in the review report of Theresa May in order to prevent the use of the register of rights in immigration and welfare aspects.
Consideration of alternatives in which voters would be required to submit a personal certificate before the vote.
The casting of the cords into a non-lethal black after the vote so that no one can vote twice.
Regular checks ensuring the nationality and right of voters.
Setting the three-year limit on requests for automatic mailing.
Abstaining from political activists the handling of the votes sent to the post and the ballot cards.
The right of the police to form guard codes around the polling stations.
Amendment of the law so that the rise of fear companies is easier under the Law of the People Act on the Extension of Voting Rights in 1983.
To refuse to take a photo at the polling stations.
Only permission from England to vote (excluding Wales).
In order to ensure the control of the staff, which means that only one person is allowed to go to the voting board at a time.
Sir Eric strongly appreciates the London police and thinks it's "unfortunate" that no crime has been raised after the Tower Hamlet case.
"The Court of Justice separated Lutfur Rahman and his representative from their duties because of corruption and anti-legislative procedures," he says.
"He was found guilty without any suspicion or criminal offence, on the basis of many grounds."
He also criticised the ineffective "assessment checks" of members of the municipal authorities' electoral lists.
"In the last year of the Court's decision to give a decision in the case of Tower Hamlet was a wake," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is very proud of its tradition as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation threatens to exercise some of its wishes to be looked after and denied."
The comparability of the Olympics with Catherine and other bicycling flights in the Rion Olympics
This week, the Olympic fans of Rio 2016 were surprised by the French biker Pauline Ferrand-Prevotis, who is likely to be surprised by the harmony with Cambridge's hero.
But according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic player is not the only fighter who has the potential to compete with a well-known person.
For the honour of all the famous growths we have in Rio cheeses and all our exhibitions, the FC has collected a list of all the Olympics whose comparability with Hollywood audiences is evident.
Forestryer and brother: The group of U.S. men is compared to Brady Ellisonia (vas.) from a child.
In addition to Catherine's two-way train, many people have noted in the social media how one train could be a two-way concert by Leonardo DiCaprio.
The U.S. team of high school men, Brady Ellison, was the cause of the images he published on myrsky Twitter, where he recalls with surprise the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the social media site and agreed to hear from a child since he remembered DiCaprio.
"I don't see itself as a possibility so big, maybe even a party and a five-thread," said Brady Huffington to the Post.
"He's a good friend, so I'll take this opportunity."
In London in 2012, British long-term champion Greg Rutherford and the recommended performer Neil Patrick Harris were awarded the opportunity, which is no doubt more likely to appear in these cases.
A large and apparent Russian thinker, Aliya Mustafina, has been said to be a double-wing American singer, Gloria Estefan.
In the Uimaradas, due to South Africa's uncle Cameron van der Burghia has been compared to Matthew Morrison, who has been known for years by Glee TV.
This user says Nathan Adrian is an "athletic version" of the exhibitor of the Inception film.
Similarly, for a long time, it has been noted by Lieutenant Rafael Nadal and the actor Josh Hartnett, who highlighted both the powerful wings and the voices.
In the hope of dreaming, Russia's Yulia Efimova reminds the performer Annalynne McCordia, and not only because of her worn skin and hair, but also because of her hair, when Nathan Adrian of the United States team is a fan, according to the "athlete version of Joseph Gordon Levitti".
These two red women, the feet of Hope Solo (vas.) and the Dexter series performer Jennifer Carpenter (right) remember each other in the shape and sight of their other plants.
Not only: this Twitter user was impressed when others also saw the possibility.
This user knows if there's a good reason for a couple of possibilities.
One tweeter said that he was recently happy when "some on the Internet have the same opinion about Hope Solon and Jennifer Carpenter's potential".
The U.S. football and Dexter series exhibits are indeed strikingly reminiscent of the shape and sight of other plants.
Many have also found comparability in Kerri Walsh-Jengings and exhibitor Laura Linney in the smiles and gold winner Gabby Douglas and Anna come back!
CBC's Olympian Commentary asks for forgiveness for saying "death as well as death" of a Chinese husband
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan, instead of a fourth of 4 x 200 metres of women's release, destroyed CBC's direct olympia survey on the average week.
The Canadian general radio company CBC has had to apologize after one of its comments said that a 14-year-old Chinese proverb had "lost tastes" and "dead as a cat".
Sculptor Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was gone when he began to paint his own mind at the end of the 4 x 200-foot free-style finish.
MacDonald, who was taken to CBC's testimonials to bring color, was heard to say: "This little 14-year-old Chinese cow, baby.
He was too excited, he walked away and died like a cat.
Thank you for that."
China's Uncle Ai Yanhan, 14, U.S.A., sent a second message at 1:57.79 and stayed 1,61 seconds from Canada Taylor Ruck, which resulted in the Canadians being arrested in China.
Observers around Canada reacted quickly to the harshness and language of the commentary.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did CBC's surgeon just say that at the age of 14, the Chinese emperor died like a cat????
The idiot didn't realize he was still in the mail."
In a 4 x 200-metre-long Chinese wedding, Ai Yanhani was described as saying: "This little Chinese girl, 14-year-old, baby.
Twitter quickly completed a series of feedback comments by Byron MacDonald, and many asked for his name.
The tweeters didn't keep their words when they heard about Byron Macdonald.
Twitterist Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you can all listen to us out of racial prejudice.
Scott Russell, President of CBC's delegation, quickly apologized to MacDonald's speech: "We apologize for the comment made by the Board of Directors.
In this case, there was to be a vote, and we are sorry that this has happened."
Finally, CBC had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted a response to comments.
In his comment, Scott Russell had to make an apology for MacDonald.
CBC then copied and added its complaint to more than 90 other tweeters’ comments, which were voted against by MacDonald.
The TV company also quickly submitted a public apology.
"We are not surprised by these opinions and that they have come to our attention.
In our previous letter we asked for our expeditious apology, and we also made an apology to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were linked to the performance of the U.S.U., not his personal.
Despite this, they were incompatible and the choice of words had to be made, and Byron is very sorry for what he said."
On Thursday night, MacDonald filed his complaint in a letter and tried to defend his forest by saying that he did not mean it as a personal matter.
"I want to apologize for my comments I gave last night after the women's message," said MacDonald in the Olympics of CBC.
"I told you about the U.S. operation, not the person.
Of course it is clear that I didn't mean anything bad in my words, and I'm very sorry."
In the primary market, the woman who had agreed to trade with the merchant destroyed customers
The customers didn't know where to look when the woman was enough in the middle of Primark to agree with the basics.
He made the situation worse by reevaluating what he appeared to be on the ground, took them out of the leg, and put them back in the restroom.
He continued his journey and finally tried four base-house shops at Bouverie Place's shopping center in Folkeston.
The sale of the Primark case located in the center of Bouverie Place, where a woman tried to find out about all of them and put them back in silence
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children, told her that after she had tried to prove her clothes, a woman was dressed unconscious and walked out of the shop without buying anything.
He says about what happened: "People didn't believe in their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the shop, took the boats off the bridge, washed her own triangle and her boat home, and put them on top of it.
He didn't even try to do it without notice, but he did it completely without shame.
They all laughed when he took his boots off his feet, and obviously didn't like them because he put them back in silence.
He did it again three times before he finally decided that he didn't want any of them, got dressed and walked out.
He didn't feel the extreme test – and he didn't think of a person who would finally buy the basics he had encountered."
At the age of 33, in Kent City, Davidson continues: "How amazing it is to think that someone brings home the basics that someone else has used and has not wasted them."
The event happened on Tuesday night.
"I have come to understand that the trader's staff are trying to remove these brands from the sale when the woman was leaving – which is right.
It would be dangerous to bring new ships home and not realize that someone else has hit them without them being wounded after that," adds Davidson.
The rapporteur for the Primark commented on this point by saying: "Primmark is aware of the situation in the Folkeston movement on 9 August.
All these products have been removed from the sale."
This is how you defend your gun against the attack by Krav Magan
The world is full of dangers, but this video found in Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We questioned Mr. Rhon Mizrachi, a former Prime Minister of the Krav Maga Union in New York, and asked him how he could find a solution to the problem of staying in close contact with a thief or a criminal.
The video shows how you can defend your opponent against it, whether the attacker approaches you from the front or back.
If the attacker is approaching back, first you need to turn around to see the attacker and get out of the fireline, says Mizrachi.
Then take the weapon so that it remains between your jaws and your jaws, and stand up against the plants free from your throat.
Then hit the attacker with his fists, and when he goes up to the rock two times, approach him with his weapon in his hand, and walk away with his gun directed at him.
The technique is appropriate if an attacker is approaching ahead. You must move out of the fireline, hold the gun and rotate it so that the attacker can't escape.
At the same time, place your weight on your weapon and stand against the attacker on your back. Turn the gun away from the attacker's shoulder, back down and hold the gun attached to your attacker.
Can you hear me?
Look at the video on how Mirrachi does it.
Remember, though, that you will be safer to get away from the kidnapper by giving up on your hands — not being Mr. Krav Maga.
World Traveler Ian Wright takes the most outlying places in Europe
The British World Traveler faced a severe test of his ability to respond and respond to come from the most distant and hostile places in Europe.
Sufffolalian poet and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove his ability to respond by drawing a Eurosetel, via Piccadilly Circux, the train’s sound system and the Russian general phone.
Before you dropped Wright, you measured the points on the Luminometer to see yourself and to show the viewers who had the language to work.
The test was performed by documentaries Ian Wright – following the internal force, and its results were surprising.
The idea of dropping out of the water can be illustrated, but in fact more bacteria are on the kitchen floor.
On the way across Europe, Wright challenges doctors and other medical professionals to strengthen good bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing he said caused no harm to others than the evil mouth.
Ian Wright became known at the beginning of his journey program, where he tested his patience by traveling around the world and by eating strange and amazing things.
Without a doubt, the decline of railway stations and water air traffic controllers has challenged Wright's response capacity.
Wright says in the document: "I've been quite concerned about my health since childhood and pushed my mouth out of all kinds of things, such as beatings, beatings and shit."
In the film she really showed her reputation as a tax.
The border was only in the drinking pool in Russia.
Luminometer measured more than 4,000 units.
As a result of the comparison, it was said that the amount in the corresponding hands is generally less than 60.
The border came against the Russian general water, where Wright refused to stop when he measured 4000 units as a result – the same number in the opposite hands is less than 60.
Wright walks together with Valion in the document sheet produced by Ian Wright – after internal power, which makes the number of bacteria visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the document: "This is a close-to-end calculus smell that I've smelled in some water.
There's nothing worse than that!
The place has to imagine that I really don't care about anything here."
Wright produced a document sheet of Ian Wright – after internal power in collaboration with Valion.
With Wright, Valio Gefil, containing milk sugar bacteria and vitamins C and D, was obtained from Valio Gefil, which helps to strengthen the desire for good bacteriology and responsiveness.
The head of the category of intermediate, mesh and novelty products in the Valium says: "We wanted to offer consumers something very new.
Something that is fascinating to look at, and at the same time tells us about the benefits of probiets.
We used a lot of time to think something crazy, and finally we decided to ask Ian."
There has been a global trend in health at the Institute.
"We just wanted to bring them into greater contact instead of talking about products and to tell our daily environment about good and bad bacteria, the importance of good health and how it relates to responsiveness.
The health of the Swedish Institute has become a global trend, and with the help of the document we can provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
The film also tells us about our smoking."
The film directed by Tom Hakala adds: "It is said that I would have lost my respect for Iran if he had lost some of our requests, such as describing the Russian water that is also shown in the film.
Of course, some points were easier for Ian when part of the time was bad.
I'm glad we got a part of some of the messy adventures on the game."
In 2015, 84% of the respondents associated milk sugar plants with, in particular, fat and preferable improvements, and 58% reported that they used at least products that have been added to dairy sugar bacteria.
Before the city's own rent in Saltashi, Cornwallis
After the earthquake, the family left 50,000 red wounds in the city to own the rent after they had received a terrible terrorist attack.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, have been forced to live in Cornwall Saltashi after complaints against several parishioners.
When the couple were forced out of the apartment, the representatives of the rental company claimed that the apartment was damaged.
The walls had paved doors, lattice windows had been rolled out, roses had been spread to lattices, and walls had been plastered with graffiti.
The Parisian community has now changed, and they are believed to be in a private home.
The head of Cornwall Housing says Donna McEvoy is afraid that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says, "This has been a lot of pressure on the people who live here, and no one should have to worry about it.
In fact, there is a lot to be proud of, because it is likely to become known as a very unpleasant part of Cornwallia.
The family is a bad thing, just like its name."
In Paris there were three boys who lived in the apartment in the past. According to the police, the family had a terrible experience in smoking tobacco, fear of close family members, use of drugs and use of drugs, as well as heavy crying, arguing and screaming.
The 47-year-old Skeldon signed the lease agreement received a provision on non-social behaviour in June.
Many of the rooms in the house under the porch were found with old wastes.
The warehouse had previously been sold drugs, and lattice vessels had been stolen.
According to the neighbors, the family was killed on the street, and the police had to call the place regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Office issued a request to the Paris office this week for an additional 11 weeks to be released voluntarily.
The oppressed neighbors were grateful for the disaster — they said their lives were global.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've been living around them for 20 years, and it's been hard all that time.
The police have been here a lot of times.
"We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet, and we're not used to it!
It's gonna be great now that they're finally shot."
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the enforcement of Cornwall’s housing agency, says that the family has failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly called on.
Roskia and old toys were thrown into the villa wall.
Fitzpatrick adds: "I am sorry that the tenant has not taken any responsibility for his or her own and family behaviour, because the decision is always the last measure that the Cornwall housing agency considers.
This was very difficult, since the conduct was extreme and their actions must have been offensive to the hostile neighbors.
I am grateful to my working group, the Devon and Cornwall police and the members of the Community who participated in the work and offered to give us information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of the neighbours and give a message that non-social behaviour is not acceptable."
Fitzpatrick says the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but they were already twelve.
An empty bag was found after the crash from one bedroom.
The housing workers must now remove the wastes around the house.
In 2014, the police built a apartment and found more than 70 grams of concrete and other supplies and 1,700 pounds of hand.
Skeldon received a German fine when he was found guilty of class B drug management for the purpose of selling it.
He claimed that he was rich in 2013 in an automobile accident for his son Lee Skeldon's grave.
After her homelessness, Skeldon and her husband have heard of a change in their private situation in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were destroyed by graffiti.
The police say that they have to make a decision for the tenants who break the rules of the lease agreements.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall's police are clearly warning the tenants who continue to break the rules.
"This is a clear message to those who think they can act as they want without charges, as well as to those who have to suffer from such behavior," says Crow.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and non-social behaviour and continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
On the ground, the beach's hypothetical army skiing scared tourists in Portugal
The sun's servants have experienced a breakdown in their lives in the Portuguese Aveiro.
Portugal's P-3C Orion aircraft landed on an emergency landing.
According to air forces, there was a training aircraft which did not threaten safety.
The picture looks like a moment when tourists were forced to take control of their luggage when the low-air skier flew across the sea.
A dramatic picture of how an army plane will be approaching its target position in the skylight of tourists from North Portugal in Aveiro.
The performers rose to their feet as they were concerned about the engine of the cooling engine, which began to be part of before they saw what was coming through the shadows.
The incident occurred last night in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the pictures and videos of the dramatized entertainment media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: "It ended the sun twice down, and there was a moment when it looked like it was eating on the ground."
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was in Surfama and I was sure that the machine would fall on me."
The tourists on the coast of the Aveir experienced a shock when the plane suddenly arrived at sight and flew down the steep plain.
The Portuguese authorities were informed today that the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training plane which was intended to identify coastal fishing vessels and therefore had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little normal underground because the nearby forests caused the damage of visibility, but according to the air force, this did not threaten safety for anyone.
Forests have caused destruction in parts of Manner-Portuguese and have killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese authorities knew today that because of the bad appearance of the sand and sand, the aircraft had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight in which the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels.
The outcome of the first half of Exocs is better expected
South Karjala Social and Health (Exote) has made a far better result - EUR 3.4 million planned in June.
The result of the surplus was a surplus of EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services where the development of preventive services has enabled the establishment to be replaced.
The treatment was carried out in all operations.
Exote has tried to reduce the scope of the measure this year.
Exotics are covered by excess of pre-born subordinates.
More than that, it may be used to reduce side effects and to buy measures for patients.
The result of the year is expected to be 4.6 million euros better planned.
The Exegetical Government shall consider the mid-year report at its meeting first Wednesday.
Seventy-seven Special Doctors swore by the military officer in Immol
Seventy-seven men from the coastal and maritime insurance school were sworn by the military during the holidays.
In Immol, the military force of the armed forces of the coastal and maritime schools was organized during spring.
The holiday season for the Tenth Special Doctors was organized by the sports industry.
The army took 70 men.
Specialist doctors shall be trained in cross-border security, information and combat activities.
They're serving 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were asked to serve as special surgeons.
They were called 250.
Specialist doctors have been trained in Immol since 2007.
In the context of the anti-fraud regime, the veterinary treatment involved five wartime groups.
The average age of those who were involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the occasion were born in 1918.
Cross-border fraud - crime reporting helps to resolve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
In each of the 11 Finnish police institutions, since 2014, RTA has been operating as a crime investigation and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible outside.
There are four police units in the Hammeen City and Lahde.
It'll lead to the Supreme Court of Lath.
Commissioner Lahde shall act as chairman.
In addition, the unit's strength includes the data technology of a civilian person who has been killed in the Hameenlin.
They're all working in civil society.
The Unit has demonstrated its ability to use and its necessity, is considered by the Deputy Police Officer Tero Seppenen.
The RTA unit produces different findings to other police.
In a surprise, it has also acquired information about asylum seekers.
Reform of the new working methods
The establishment of analytical units is a reform of the youth policy working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, that is to make the police go even more rarely to the south than when they receive a warning.
By means of information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police action shall be directed to where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one crime centre was established, under which three state units and one police unit were established.
The PTR Centre, which operates in the context of the central policy in Vantaa, will conduct its activities in a state-of-the-art manner.
The PTR units work on behalf of the people of the Police, Customs and National Guard.
The RTA units are working in the areas distributed by the police institutions, and their task is to provide information to local police authorities and public authorities.
Information goes outside its own area
Where a private police officer is responsible for what has happened during his 12-hour working hours, the task of the RTA must be to know what is happening in the area of the entire police station.
The information also extends beyond the borders of its own institution because it does the same for crime.
The RTA unit has better basic policies.
One is trying to focus on new phenomena, products that are criminal or other crimes that remind one another of registrations, alerts and findings.
This is called for induction, and it is one of the most important tools for crime education.
All people have their own way of doing things.
Handicrafts are also seen at work, then it was real or criminal.
On the basis of the facts, a certain picture is formed.
Deterioration can be done either on the basis of an act or by a person depending on whether the police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The RTA staff do not drive the goods to the city to be able, but their work is not fully publicized.
Neither of itself nor of the methods of criminal use is reported because it could lead to professional development and thus to the prevention of police crime.
The police will be publicly informed of the procedure if it anticipates the threat posed by them.
For example, the case was from the beginning of a novelty, used in residential buildings to mark dwellings in empty spaces.
It was where the authors set up the apartment on the outside of the lake, a cliff or a pond where they tried to find out if they were really on the streets.
The chairperson shall be at least public.
The analysis has found that the most professional criminals are learning from their mistakes.
For example, they require a protocol on the rights of offenders, which may indicate that there have been found tears in their eyes.
The next time we go to the castles, we're gonna get a bunch of hamlets in our hands.
For this reason, the Deputy Police Officer has been questioned by Tero Seppäs Hämee, Commissioner Tuomo Lepolaa of the East-Suomen Police, Commissioner Sami Joutjärvee Joensuu at the police station and the criminal prosecutor Arto Tuomela at the Central Criminal Police.
The police collected and analysed information that would help to plan practical action.
Reducing labour and funding rates.
The first steps towards a new approach were already taken 30 years ago.
The last change was a three-stage PORA reform which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation will collect information from its own institution and from outside Finland.
Isis-related Western education received her death in Syria
News reports that one of the three British colleges associated with Isis last year, Kadiza Sultana, was killed in Syria.
Agent Tasnime Akunjee tells the girl's family that Sultana died in Syria a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in the Russian airfield Raqjana, which is Isis' support in Syria, told ITV News as Torstana.
Sultana was 17 years old and her family were planning to leave the country of war and return to Britain.
"It can only be hoped that this will serve as a warning example and as a testimonial so that people will understand that this is a real risk to the war zone - and that people will be allowed to decide on leaving," says Akunjee.
Sultana rose in February 2015 together with two other East-East-Ethical trainers to the Turkish aircraft and continued on their way by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had been married in Syria with an Isis fighter and remained in bed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says that Clinton supports the name of Garland to his highest right if he is elected
Senator Harry Reid says he is convinced that President Hillary Clinton is the Supreme Justice Judge of Merrick Garland if he is elected President.
The representatives of the Senate have not agreed to confirm the name of Garland after Barack Obama named him in March.
According to Senator Mitch McConnell, the next president is elected by a person to fill the seat of Judge Anton Scalia of the Supreme Court.
Reid said in his long-term phone negotiations that he was predicting that he would choose the Garland of Clinton "almost secure".
Reid's informant later checked that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton, he was going to call it Garland.
Reid went over Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "infect the ocean" by choosing someone else.
Garland is Judge of the U.S. Court of Justice at the District Court of Columbia.
Reid says President Donald Trumpi is a "fashioned" and "result".
He says Trump doesn't fit in.
According to the traats paper, sub-calendars belong to women as well as men
The Treats page cooperates with photographer David Bellemer and brings to the market a calendar of Pirelli's inspired calendar from the 1970s and 2017.
Instead of public media, they want to find their next generation's best-known NU Museums calendar in 2017.
The director of the treatment told Steve Shaw earlier this year that his understatement of his journals would exclude him from the old school playboy paper because he said: "Playboy is for men.
I'll do this to women."
Apparently he's thinking about the calendar.
"We must bring back the idea and classic underworld where women, wherever men are, can enjoy these beautiful pictures and inspire them," says Shaw in a paper release.
"Women certainly want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful art work."
They want to send their pictures via the network or participate in the open elections held in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinylyl's surprise: who's buying the leaves?
Single, middle-aged men like guilt.
Before you are asked to write a comment on your angry response on behalf of the People of the Middle Ages, this claim is based on real research data.
According to YouGov research company, the new generation of vegetarians discussed is not the life of the millennial sex generation when the millennials want to feel in their hands about physical material, but instead they have medium-life nostalgia.
The most likely difference between 45 and 54 is a person who buys a vinyl album.
In fact, 18-24 age groups are least likely buyers.
Also, there is not only the desire of the prospectors to spread spread spreads but the importance is clear: the buyers of the older wineries feel a little more likely to be in the dark (56% v. 53%) and enjoyed alone (69% v. 66%).
But do you like the results of youGovin?
If this blog were a news link, the camera would follow me while I was walking a long distance from the Soho Street, above me a three-way section. I would shake my hands slowly, shake my hands and say something traditional, like, "Let's get clear."
Let's get it clear.
Although Soho has recently lost its tremendous power and rediscovered when hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases have been owned by private companies before, however, there are still serious specialities.
I would probably ask the painter to stop the camera for a moment when I apply very close to the men visiting these shops and try to assess their age and nature.
Glassowlinen Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray's movement (at this moment two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records movement (at this moment eight middle-aged men, one probably twelve-year-old woman) is on a trip to London in the evening and spends more time on business.
I wonder if he's a collector.
"I think so," she says.
"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 copies."
These sheets fill his living room wall, as you can see. (Stuart sent me an e-mail picture, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired so many albums and singles is partly in his available income. He is now able to buy copies that he did not have when they first appeared and buy new things that he was young and had to sell without money.
"A lot of stories at the end of the 60s and at the beginning of the 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 and probably too young to get them," she says.
He agrees that the purchasers are more likely to be introverts who hate themselves and add: "I don't burn, I don't even eat.
It's my worst."
Wez, 25, who works in Sister Ray's company, also believes that many of their customers agree with their YouGov profile.
However, he has found a new human virus, which has been affected by media hypocrisy. These people have heard of the arrival of grapes and now feel compelled to buy their old leaves back.
"On the basis of my discussions, people were generally allowed to gather in 1998 or 1999.
Customers selling their wines to buy CD albums are now selling their CD albums to buy their wines back," he says.
This can explain the life of certain wines.
And then what about the emotional significance of voices claimed?
In just a few seconds, they will find in a movement like Phonican that they offer comfort to the same type of community.
According to Wezi, some of the older customers have been particularly affected by their unconnected payment system.
The digital world may surprise some of the vinyl phosphanes to which the return to the well-known living cells means stability and reminds you of the days of youth.
"I think that sometimes something opens up or material property is acquired for some comfort," says Wez.
"I do it myself as a collector, and I believe that so do many others.
It's easy to get ideas for others."
'We're like social workers!' said Wez's staff officer.
The ICM study in April revealed that almost 50 % of the vinyl album purchased last month had not yet been heard.
The opinion study also stated that 41% of those who have never used it and 7% of those who buy wine are not even on their own.
At this stage of the news, I would probably look like a heavy face at the same time as such an artificial boss of nova.
The new arrival of vineyard trees is also associated with "pocalyptic science", which has been found by the Sounds of the Universe movement (at the moment of the sale of three middle- aged men) by Jonny, 42.
"A client came late and said he doesn't have a radio call, but he wants to buy a Radiohead tape so he can put it off," Jonny says.
"The share of other clients is not large, but they are.
The material is more important to them than music.
Some of our clients tell us they haven't been on the phone yet.
They're younger, not older, longer than teenagers, who're just starting out."
The customer service is much more flexible in Foppi, where I get the next one.
The customers are 70 parishes, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
The variety of customers is kind, although the feeling is not as rare as in previous movements: to use the red walk instead of the jagged jizzin instead of the new sexes of Wild Beasts is a frequent synthetic pop.
None of the clients seem particularly lonely, but a serious psychological trauma is difficult to find in a position near someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been traveling around Foppia for a few minutes and has been looking at the various sections on the ground.
He's better looking at things than making purchases.
He's telling the kids that he's coming, so it's not possible for him to collect the pieces.
"They don't pay much.
The music is easy to hear from the computer or otherwise, but the beauty of the violin is ...", she delivers a wonderful care and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a shop called a new plant of vinyl phosphine: Urban Outfitters.
I see a group of teen-age girls who would imagine hijacking face-to-face types, but who will be gathered for a moment around the polaroid cameras. I see a father and a girl who are based on the purchase of a cross-line call.
On the left there is a portal filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac's leaves: a combination of contemporary music and classics, centrally distributed for any medium course.
No one sees the wall, perhaps because it's just an element and part of it is so high that it's not even common.
They're pure art vinyl.
However, given that all the means to pay attention to these publications are likely to make more money in the area and send some customers to the Sohono auction, it is not right to choose.
It is not surprising that a group of people who are more likely to have more time and money than most have, is also the group that spends most of its money on the public, such as the winemakers.
However, while youGovin's results are based on my studies, at least in Soho's newspapers, they do not close up a large number of female smokers and vinyl fans, which are in fact both in the media and in the web forums.
These people are probably deeply involved in school or at work.
They certainly do not take their tortoises in Berwick Street’s newspapers, filming magazines, and avoiding television broadcasts from 30 years of age, which are frightening and frightening to innocent middle-aged men.
Holker, i.e. the ice is the longest live light – video report
According to the researchers, the longest living cell in the world is frozen.
According to researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest surviving population was found in a study of 272 to 512 years.
The French Court rejected the application for a five-year course of trade
The French court has rejected the application by the Calais authorities, where they have demanded the expulsion of tens of thousands of refugees in five schools of temporary shelters and restaurants.
The authorities of Calais presented in this week's legal proceedings the claims that the State should be allowed to issue 72 temporary contracts based on passports. The goods sell to the residents of the refugee camp different goods from the tobacco industry and offer spare parts.
According to the Calais Prefectviranomas, these goods and restaurants must be destroyed because they do not pay taxes and thus represent the economy, and because they are associated with fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the Court that goods and restaurants are essential for the victims, as public airports offered by the State support organisation and other wishes are not sufficient for the growing population.
According to them, temporary stores and restaurants often offer protection and free food for their needs.
The Court of First Instance ruled that the arrest of a 72-year-old trader had no legal basis, but that Calais' prefect's concern was "to be fully understood".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, food stores, coffee shops and restaurants are far more important than providing food to people who "live in extremely poor conditions".
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places below the garbage dump was the Jungle Book Kids coffee shop, which is a win-win and offers 200 atriums a day, English and French feeling and security transfer to hundreds of villages without a caregiver, whose position is the most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed an address where children’s coffee is required to be kept.
According to a letter sent to the Guardian, its closure would be "an accident for these children who are only 8 years of age".
Two welfare organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after the increase in the number of fireplaces, the number of five schools has increased to more than 9,000.
Food price is clearly lower in Finland than in the EU average
Food has a negative effect on the happiness of consumers and on the food of producers in Finland.
Food prices have dropped by nearly five per cent in Finland in three years when the average price in EU countries dropped by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food has become the most expensive in Germany and Sweden.
During the last three years, food prices have fallen in Finland, mostly from EU countries with a level similar to that in Finland.
From comparisons only in Britain, food prices have dropped faster than in Finland.
The information will appear in the development of the Statistics Centre of Ilkka of the Journal published in the Information & Trends blog.
The paper compared real prices, i.e. prices related to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is since June of this year.
In early 2010, the price of food rose dramatically.
In 2013, prices fell close to 1994.
Your situation was urgent.
"We were close to losing the price that came from EU membership," the paper says.
Then you followed your turn, after which food became worse for a year.
The prices now weigh on Russia's food import restrictions, which have caused food to freeze from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and the prices of agricultural producers have fallen.
"Poutin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in a short time," the newspaper says.
The registered price competition between industry and trade has also affected price reductions.
The large S-group and Kesko shopping carts have both calculated their prices.
Consumer price competition has been seen as popular campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a source of good food, although the price of food has dropped sharply.
In 2015, food was fourth in Finland from EU countries which had a similar level of remuneration as Finland.
According to the paper, the price of food sold in Finland has a significant impact on price tax.
He found that if there was the same rate of VAT, he would sell food from the same third countries in Finland.
The paper compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If there were seven net tax rates, only Germans and Dutch people would sell more food than Finnish.
"If we want to get to the level of the EU's old countries at the cost of food, we need value tax to be half the EU's average and continue price negotiations," writes the Journal.
The paper notes that the calculated percentages of the value-added tax made by him are indicative.
School isn't so much before.
A return to school may indicate that there has been a change in school during the summer.
The school has developed a new teaching plan, which is taken up at the beginning of the class in all of the classrooms.
It is a guide to all Finnish schools.
Schools decide for themselves details, but the plan sets out official objectives.
New guidelines have been developed over several years, and they differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
In other words, the teaching of beauty literature is created, and instead they are taught by codification at school.
Sweden's education is already beginning in the sixth grade, and society is already being read by four.
However, the major change concerns the role of students.
Before it was thought that the teacher was teaching students, but now everyone must be active and learn from others.
In this way we try to make school work more interesting.
The world's long-lasting silver mine has been found. The remains can live for 400 years.
The most known Greenland haemorrhage (Somnosus microcephalus) reaches 150 years of age of gender.
It can live 250 years later, reports a new study.
The figures make the species of the longest-lived planet in the world.
In the animal society, it ends only an Icelandic doll, which is the oldest known individual of 507 years old.
Greenland is a long way from North Atlantic.
Their management also has another prediction: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The snakes hunt dogs for longer. They can grow even more than five feet [5 m].
Because the growth rate is slow, according to the findings, only about a centimetre a year, adults have been more aggressively living for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen took a clear view of his colleagues.
He determined that there would be a 28-year-old stay in the fish stocks that had been left for the request of fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radio broadcast of the eyes.
The mean age of the disease studied was at least 272 years.
Two large fish, 493 and 502 centimetre amaconies, were discovered at about 335 and 392 years of age.
As previous studies have shown that breast cancers reach more than four quarters of the population, researchers estimate that they are about 150 years old.
The research would publish Science.
From Stockmann to nearly 300 - salesmen are not reduced
Nearly 300 employees are expelled from Stockmann.
In the event of difficulties, the cooperatives concluded in the company in early August.
"As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs are reduced, most of which are carried out as exits," says Stockmann in his report.
According to it, the number of sellers of commodities is not reduced so that the customer service does not suffer.
In addition, some 80 employees of support activities are offered a new job as seller.
Stockman's net negotiations relate to about 3,000 employees.
At the beginning of these measures, there were an estimated 380 workers.
A small reduction is intended to cover about EUR 20 million per year, which is to be implemented in the first year.
Stockmann has already launched an effective programme aimed at achieving the savings of EUR 50 million this year.
As a result, it is difficult for Stockman to obtain support for the trade in goods.
Although the Group's adjusted business income improved by EUR 11.1 million in the second half of the year, trade in goods continues to disappear.
According to the company's sales manager, Mr Vejalais, according to the company's director, the sales in the retail sector has not been higher than the company's objectives.
"Reductions of personnel are unfortunately necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retal's positive business income in 2018," Vejalanen says in his report.
The second annual income saving rate was particularly impressive for Lindex's success.
Kätje achieved the best of all times of the second year of his business and his income.
Lindex's profit grew by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
In the last year, the total turnover of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimated that this year's business change in the group will take place in the last year.
The adjusted business income is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is set in the north - temperature below 20 degrees across the country
The centre of the low pressure on the northern part of Finland is considered to be a hundred yards away, reports HS meteorology Ilona Läng.
There are also seeds in the middle of the country, but there is still a drought in the south.
The temperature is no longer very moderate, as life expectancy is below 20 degrees throughout the country.
In the northern ports, there are between 10 and 15 degrees.
Kenya's General Security Team handles the doping channel - explanation for the manufacturer's failure
Kenyan generalist John Anzrah was sent from the Olympics to the home of the Rion after it became apparent that Anzrah was present in the doping test.
The news agency AP said that the athlete Anzrah tried to show was 800 metres old-fashioned Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenyan Arap Group, said that Anzra’s personality was revealed after he had given the spectacular performance of Rotichia.
The Doping Operators went to announce to the Anzrah authorities.
According to Anzrah, he was sent home because he "has committed a crime against the Kenyan peasants."
He showed up as a musician, gave a show and even signed documents.
We cannot accept any of these uses," the chairman of the Kenya Olympics Committee, Kip Keino, for the rest of the news agency to Reuters.
Olympian generalization starts on Friday, and Rotich is about to run right away.
There is still no idea whether the driver has any consequences for the case.
Rotich was placed on the MM's fourth trip last year and is the first winner of Rion.
According to Reuters, the source of the Kenya General Security Team was claimed to have been in the company of Anzrah just to get public anterios at the station.
When the antidotes met him, they were his dancer and he was taken to the test.
The manufacturer did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid that he would reveal himself," she said.
Where's everybody?
Rion's general irradiation has been wiped out
Where's everybody right?
They're not the only ones on Rion's Olympic Stadium in the next.
In Russia, competition was launched on Friday from the mass media, but the world’s top players were able to present their art to an amazingly empty view.
Rion's organizers reported on Friday that only 58% of breakfasts were sold and 65% of evenings were sold.
The other was four years ago in London, where the stadium was packed with people who were starving.
The finals are already sold in Riossa.
The view of the Rion Olympics has already been taken into account before general warming.
For example, thousands of empty pockets have been seen in the sights of rugby, melon and sailing.
When Brazilian medalists Talita Antunes and Larissa played the flag in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the audience was full.
After the Brazilian casino, Holland played against Russia, and about 30 percent of the 12,000 lives were full.
A bad mistake is to explain at least that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympics are strange to Brazilians who are accustomed to football.
In fact, even the first takeover of the Brazilian football team was not completely carried out.
The newsmagazine journalist Mario Andrada said at the end of the week that 82 percent of the lead was sold at that time, which is clearly smaller than four years ago.
"There's still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million Olympics in London, 8.2 million were sold, although nearly half of them were spent in Rios.
In Russia, prices for lipsticks have changed from about EUR nine to more than a thousand open euro.
More than half of the slippers pay less than EUR 16.
In the Olympics in London, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty places, but this has not been allowed in Russia since organizers need money and try to get tickets sold up to the last minute.
In Russia, organizers have indeed given 240,000 ligaments to less-known species in the country, such as golf and rubber.
At the Rion stadiums, there were empty spaces in the morning.
Even the orange ball Copacaban has not been of interest to the public.
Jukka Centre competed in London 2012.

A new way to protect nature - acquire the right to land
Helsinki Foundation participates in the new way of natural protection.
In recent years, the Foundation has acquired ecologically significant natural areas for its ownership.
Thereafter, private companies and communities can use money to raise their rights in the rural area.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area from the Child.
The area has been divided virtually into accounts that wish to acquire the right of the holder.
The holder shall be entitled to a total of 187 fourths of its total veto right of veto, which in practice means that each holder does not need to be approved if the intended use of the land is intended to be changed.
The holder's rights can also be acquired for more than one year.
Acquisition of government rights is something specific that can leave your family or give you a gift.
There is no need to go carry banners or look at yourself in order to protect the nature of the right to rule," according to Dr. Leviäkkas, who acquired the right to control the company.
The acquisition of the right of administration shall be subject to precise location information, such as the entry into force of the visit.
The names of the holders of the rights acquired on the website of the Foundation are listed on the same map as the land area's logbooks.
The Leviathan considers its nature protection project to be a risk only if the institution's activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a general institution aimed at promoting environmental and natural protection.
The risk is that the institution did something unfair or commercial, but it should not be possible.
The basic concept of the Helsinki Foundation’s management project is to protect natural areas so that they can be independent and peaceful.
The institution acquired land areas either by buying or by offering.
It is financed primarily by the sale of the rights of the holder, but the institution has been established on its own initiative.
The purpose of the institution is to acquire additional protections.
It also focuses on the external borders of Finland and plans to move from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop-up event at the Helsinki dealer on 13-19 August.
The pirates suffer from the worst of the cities Turku - see your home situation
The Bolpus are suffering from the worst of the cities in Finland.
This year, more than nine other major cities have been robbed of their residence.
Helsingin Sanomat explained on the basis of the information received to the police, which in most of the 10 major cities of this year has stolen dormitories and parts of them are estimated to be thousands of dwellings.
In addition to the market, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to the police, there were four points of reference to thousands of residents.
Instead, only about two roundabouts were reported to the police in Espoo and Koulola about a thousand inhabitants.
Good luck with that.
"In other cities, the number of shelters related to housing is similar to that of others," said police officer Tommi Reen.
The police of the market are wondering why the city is on the same spot.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bicycles have been stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I don't have a answer for that.
"The generality of the barracks can affect how many cities are moved by bicycles and how many bicycles they have," said the superintendent Theemu Eikäs.
The police administration Tommi Reen is very expected to rise in comparison to the mountains of Turku, Helsinki and Oulu.
The number of wheeled gears goes far beyond what are learning and cycles.
In the market there is a strong centre, short distances and a lot of bicycles to offer to fishermen.
"Espoo, for example, is a very diverse city where city centres are on the other side, and it is not an essential means of transport," Reen says.
Throughout Finland, the police know-how has become a little less expensive in January-July than in the last year.
The greatest joy, however, is not to be found.
In the last few years, despite the fact that the police have failed, there will be less than 20,000 rounds per year.
It means 50-60 phillars every day and only about 4,000 rounds a year in Helsinki.
"They're great," Reen says.
In fact, the guards are bringing more bikes, because only part of the victims inform the police of the theft.
Reen calls on people to make a report of the crime scene, even if the case reported to the police is less than ten times over.
Typically, the theft of a bike is one where the police get information about the stolen goods immediately and the thief gets caught in blood.
"The events also occur in other studies when, for example, stolen bicycles can be found in the housing in which smoking can be found," Reen says.
In Helsing, drivers are arrested every week for their own work or for the police investigation, says the older constable Timo Leppämek.
According to him, bicycles are stolen, for example from commercial centres, domestic stores, warehouses and bicycles, in practice, from all places where they are usually kept.
In more recent years, Job has been robbed of his personal bicycles.
The U-block gives the bike a better protection than many other holes.
For example, some of the stockers take a short-term bicycle for their own use, but most of the stolen bicycles end up selling, for example, via the Internet.
They're staying on their home market.
"The police have never come to know that stolen bikes would just go abroad," Reen says.
The buyers of stolen bicycles are considered to be ordinary Finnish according to the police.
I'm sure you can buy part of a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The owner of the bicycle used must be careful because he may be guilty of an offence or an offence.
"The alerts should be sounded if the approvals are clearly sold," Reen says.
Specialist Severi Hirvi wears no colour on Nopsan's working days at Kallio's library in Helsinki.
He's got five keys, but no one's stolen, Hirvi says. "There's never been taken, there's been a good bank."
"Maybe this isn't so appealing to you, there's no need to be a hipster value here," the Helsinian Hirvi points out.
A short time ago, Siri Valve closed his wallet with a small u-class in Helsinki.
Now the wheel was pushed against the wall, but Valve usually closes his bike to something like a bicycle.
"There will be a lot of time to think about it, because this is my dearest thing," says the Helsinskileman from his white circle, which alone paid about five euros.
"All the time it's heard from the guys that the bikes have been taken."
"Most of the bad bikes, such as these-Jopoys."
Self-insurance was stolen several years ago from the inside of the company.
The four of us were really left unattended, so the Watch was waiting for its anaesthesia to take place.
Are you under 15 years of age responsible for crimes?
Helsinki's experimenting with U.S. comparator companies
In Helsinki, a so-called anti-comparator company is attempting to prevent young people from becoming involved in crime.
At the start of the experiment, it is applied to under 15 years of age, which are now free of criminal responsibility.
I don't think it's the first young man to commit a crime.
The idea is that the anti-dumping company is discussing the incident with the perpetrators of the crime and imposing sanctions.
A week later, the perpetrators of the crime may join themselves to improve their performance.
Other consequences, for example, may be a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned.
Young Acting Director Tommi Latio says that the model is not hard.
We've got some other conveniences that are used in the market.
"All are directed towards a young person's actions more responsible, so that everything will not go wrong for the first time," Latio says.
A model of the U.S. model has been taken from the comparison industry, where it is widely used.
The idea is that the young man, not after his first crime, had to face the adult panel but reflected on what happened with the same planners.
Mallia's been tested once.
The experience followed by the Service Department of the Palmum Service Manufacturer Iika Lovio says there was a misunderstanding that was found successful.
In particular, the first crimes of less than 15 years have not necessarily been dealt with before.
"It's been a message that you keep choosing the road," Lovio says.
A similar company is part of the Helsinki project of the Finnish Immigration Service, which is followed by the city of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasizes that new methods of action are offered to all in need, not only to immigrants.
More than 70 Republican actors want the party to stop financing the Trump campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are told in a signed letter asking for the end of the presidential campaign to be financed by Donald Trump.
The letter was published by the United States newspaper Politico, which had come to see the nature of the letter.
According to I, an open letter has been addressed to the President of the National Committee of the Republican Reince Priebus.
Signatories want money to be directed to the convention elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his inconceivable incompetence, incompetence and premiselessness threaten to bring about a voter in these elections," says Politicon.
Only directing all possible funds to the Congressional elections can prevent the Republicans from breaking the Trump-Korist yoke on the coast.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as the opportunities for the Presidential election to win will be less than one day.
Politico writes that the letter is intended to be sent in the first week.
The signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the body members of the letter is apparently the representative of my Republic, Andrew Weinstein.
According to politics, Weinstein has said that a letter will come from "people who want to protect their majority in Congress" and there is no support in this regard.
The book lists a number of the works of Donald Trump, which are believed to be composed of millions of voters.
In addition, he says that he has shown dangerous authoritarianism.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officers who were employed in a number of cases reported in an open letter that they did not support Donald Trumpia as president.
Clinton promises to make it easier for the United States children
In the United States, the President-in-Office of Democrats Hillary Clinton told his economic policy details on Thursday morning.
I am trying to be president so that the United States economy will go well in every way.
"Donald Trump was trying to be president so that the economy would go well with him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
The center of Clinton's plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year programme for improving U.S. infrastructure - yours, bridges and airports.
This would be financed by the tax havens of the rich, by private money.
The construction program is a handshake for American dunes who suffer from the effects of the move to poor countries.
Clinton called for greater investment in well-paid jobs after World War II.
We're his construction team. We have to go back to build!
Clinton said.
In Torstena, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families.
On the contrary, in Torstana he heard from Sanders that the rich should pay their share of taxes.
And if the company's leaving the United States as a warhead, it's gonna have to pay for it, Clinton said.
Now he is against the Free Trade Agreement of the Pacific, which he had previously supported.
"As [the President] I oppose all trade agreements that work against workers or wages," Clinton promised.
According to estimates published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to consider the economic programme published by the Republican Donald Trump on Monday because it "saving only such millions".
The firm's proposal for a fall in corporate tax has previously been called "Turper's tax base".
As Torstain Clinton insisted he was the daughter of a little boy himself.
He reminded the audience of the minors who had left Trump’s bills free of charge and the clothes that Trump himself was making in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America bigger again, he should start making his own products in America," Clinton insisted.
These are Rio's reviews: The cats have not moved Finnish to the top of the streets, but the mobile app is interested in
It's normal for sports fans to watch TV on the beach.
The Rion Olympics are not intended to be different from most of the destinations.
Once upon a time, cats have added 12 percent of the population to the Red Sea: the night sky followed Ylen’s Olympics from TV2: at the same time 615 000 spectators.
Because of the comparison: the month-on-month-on-the-spot EMs received nearly 800 000 viewers on TV2 at the end of the month, and the feet of the EMs were set at two million.
Of the Olympics, the most interesting is the Sunday-night cycle and the five-day open-ended television show, which was aimed at the Olympics once and for nearly half a million spectators.
The general director of the sport Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the audiences, and he recalls that the viewers share in the Rion Olympics for the first time several different instruments.
In addition to television, the Finnish are following the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how much of its TV viewers choose Olympics.
TV and Yle Fem channels are also shared by viewers.
The Rion Olympics are the first to be played by Yle who owns the entire canal.
When the shipment comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are up to 500,000 for the whole period, so it's a good basis.
Views are smaller than in 2012 in London or in 2008 Beijing, but the difference is explained in part by time - most of Rio's reviews will come to Finland at night.
Another reason why we are interested - if someone likes it now - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken the initials of someone's surprise, the interest would have been pumped up by it.
In addition, public pollution is just beginning, as are other types of Finnish interest: pollution and pollution.
According to Poksise, the original figures have been expected to be close.
When the general alarm starts, the viewers will explode.
You have launched a Yle Rio 2016 mobile application for cookies, which rose on the first day of your check app App Stores in Finland as the freeest application.
By Monday the application had been applied 150 000 times.
I'm afraid we're on the streets of 200,000.
"We'll get a week's watch later," Pokinen says.
Rio Arena has not worked with all users with hope.
Pokkinen says that the return has come and the cows have been repaired.
The use of Rio Arena has been associated with a slow and less technical problem at the starting stage.
Updated versions have been obtained from applications which should correct errors.
Rion Olympics are seen in the Ylen Canal and arena wider than any other sporting event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can monitor some types, and on the radio Yle Fue spends his time on cheeses every day.
The Olympics are probably the most working animals in the world, as are the last ones that can only follow from the Yle Canal.
From 2018 onwards, olympia is seen both in general and in commercial channels.
How deep is the deep lake of Finland?
According to official statistics, Finland’s deep lake is Your Day, whose depth is 95.3 metres from Ristinsel.
It may be even more serious.
The technical trainer Matti Kannela found a 20 - foot - long [20 km] weight gain from Ristisel, which was shown at the bottom to be 104 meters.
In the mid-2014s, the Finnish Centre for Environment tried to strengthen the discovery by total consumption.
The procedure does not necessarily find a small depth of one hundred metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
For the second time, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 metres) and Suvas River (90 metres).
More than 80 meters away from Saima, Two Waters and Pejärvi.
They have not been examined as much as the Sun.
In particular, the base of Inarijärve has not been accurately carded.
"There could be a good way to find unknown hearts," Kannela says.
If the deep lake is determined by mean life, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 metres.
As a result of this examination, your Day will not reach the ten most serious groups, and the Suvas water will be even longer.
Correction 12 August 14:29: The last chapter was corrected where the most serious lakes were wrong.
Any tax: Taxation of pensioners continues to be faster
The tax on pensioners is still higher than the wage earners.
The honourable Member said that there was a lack of interest on the part of representatives and the tax on pensioners was granted equal value for employers.
The presentation of the Government does not include such a statement.
We think it should certainly be.
The promised promises should be broken after the election, he says to the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners were reduced in earnings which slowed tax.
In his delegation, he was angry with the opposition of the representatives of the Ministry of State for Finance, Alexander Stubbia (c.e.) of the elections.
The purchasing power is protected, it does not grow
In the presentation by the Minister of State of State Petter Orpon (C.E.), on the line of taxation, Ihala says that it is about the protection and not the increase of the purchasing power, as wages are not increased in the first year.
He says that tax aviation is beneficial for purchasing power and employment if other matters do not increase people's uncertainty.
The honourable Member is pleased with the wishes of Prime Minister Juha Sipil (Central) and the Orpo message to respect the ability to reach a competitive agreement when it is difficult.
He says that keeping hold of the treaty is important in terms of faithfulness.
This is the most important economic and employment policy action in the government.
It has been done by the labour market organisations, so it does not take it seriously by asking questions.
This will be necessary, as the economy is so much in the hands of domestic demand and people's own future.
Long-term unemployment allowance
Any person invites the government to suffer from long-term unemployment in the budget sector, at least to stop its growth.
In June there were some 17,000 long-term unemployed more than a year ago.
He says that if growth stops, the government's aim is to increase employment by 72 per cent.
He warns that if the long-term unemployment challenge is ignored, the promise has a very high social cost.
By letter: In Thailand’s villages, of course, there are no Finnish victims
In Thailand last night and last night, at least four people died during the bombings in Finland.
The delegation calls on the Finnish authorities in the country to monitor and avoid the fastest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for adult Finnish tourists in Thailand to leave because of the explosions on their way, but the orders of the Grand Mission are based on caution, says Westphale.
In Thailand very little Finnish
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finnish people in Thailand, although their precise number is difficult to assess.
The Finnish Thailand trip is due to an annual change.
The majority of Thailand's passengers will come from South Europe and China this year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from the Finnish people in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The main mission has been to provide information on the situation in the city to the Finnish people in Hua Hini, in particular.
However, many of our contact staff in Hua China are away from the city right now.
In general, by taking everything into account that it's going to be okay, Westphal says.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
According to Westphalen, there's still no information about the factors of the rats.
The main message is that events can be associated with the political instability of the divided society in Thailand and the recent referendum on the establishment of a military force.
The law was adopted in a referendum.
The vote was not an open, democratic process.
In other countries, people were arrested, including those who reported their respective laws.
In the southern part of Thailand, there is a ethnic-national conflict on the part of Muslims, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their right of self-determination.
However, more recent issues have not been covered by tourist attractions.
There's a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphale says.
According to him, in the cities, the royal birthday and the date of the birth of the queen is celebrated.
The traffic in the city is very small.
The fact that the authorities are very precise about security affects the day-to-day course.
Thai Police: There is no question of international terrorism in the minds
According to the police, the seats are "local satellites" and separate from the usual terrorist reasons.
Islamic terrorism has also been banned, says the Thai police department according to the AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the eclipse when 11 bombs have exploded in various parts of the country, such as in the recommendations of tourists in Phuket and Hua Hinnis.
In the most popular tourist destination in Finland, Lomasiar Phuket launched four bombs last night, says the domestic newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to these findings, they did not require the death penalty.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the paper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Ngas, where one person was killed by the paper.
On the proposal for a tourist destination in Hua Hinnis, the local authorities have deployed four bombs yesterday and today.
At least one of them died in a double pump.
In addition, in South Thailand, Surat Thanin in the south coast and Trang City, at least one bomb exploded.
At least one person died in both cases.
Surat Thani has also been known to many passengers because it leads to Ko Samin, Ko Pha Nangin and Ko Taon Lomazari.
The factors of the age are unknown
According to Preyut Chan-O-Chan, leader of the Thai military unit, the actors of the elite are still not aware.
The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and madness.
We don't have to force people anymore, he told the suppliers.
According to Minister of Security Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang are related to each other.
He told the Thai BSB that the authors' intention was to destroy the country's tourism because all of the faithful have been in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on the Finnish people in the country to be careful and to avoid the fastest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for the Finnishs of Thailand to abandon their journey because of the explosions, but the orders of the Great Depression are based on caution, says Westphal.
Europeans affected
During the night of Finland, there is a very little knowledge of what happened and of their victims.
It has been proposed to get some more information from the evening Hua Hinnis.
There a local woman died and more than 20 others were injured, including at least nine foreign tourists.
The target group includes at least German, Italian, Dutch and Western.
At least three people were killed in Hua China's last siege.
Two bombs were fired by a known clock tower.
Thai PBS says the police have separated Hua Chinese territory from where it believes it has found another bomb.
The death of Thanin bomb was hidden under the government of the country.
In the village, a decent worker died.
There's at least one target.
CNN's police officer who challenged it says that two bombs were also used in Surat Than's case, which exploded about half an hour.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
In the United States, Billes won women's blackout
In the United States, Alexandra Raisman was the second point on 60,098 and Russia's Alija Mustafina on the third floor of 58,665 points.
Billes, 18, aims at the Rion's pockets of television screens by hand, on the hip and on the trees.
Billes has ruled the power of women in the last few years.
He has three front rows of eight individual world champions.
He's won the fourth and second master's prizes three times later, as well as the last and second years.
In the United States, Biles has achieved two world championships.
The best MM medals in Biles have a hip and a leg.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "The idea has no effect on tourism"
There is no concern about the impact of the Thai bombs on tourism on the effects of Thai bombs on children’s toys and toys located in the same building in the Thai Phuket.
If there is no further evidence, I don't believe that this is going to be any more amazing, the Finnish company in Asia has estimated that it has been working for about a decade.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedys in Thailand near.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then an avian influenza, and last year a bomb bomb in Bangkok.
If these had not previously been visited by tourists, of course, this would have been the case.
The care company's office is located within a few hundred metres of the explosion site.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
The employer called for about nine local time and said he couldn't support coming to the office.
The guard says that both the border and the main Bangladesh Road were completely closed early in the morning because of the clouds.
Many of my local workers came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought that the courts had been set up because of the royal birth date, Huovila says and refers to the festival in Thailand on Friday.
In Patong, the feeling was calm and calmed. The movement was allowed to open for about ten hours at a local time.
Many on the beach had not even heard of the sounds.
On the third day of Thailand’s time Patong’s traffic was normalized and most of the goods had opened their doors.
On the basis of the site of the site, the explosion has been a small time, the site of Huovila said.
Later that car was seen in the Krununupita at Jouxholmintie.
When the police came to the scene, the car was set on fire.
The party found two men who were suitable for identification as a man who had been hidden for nearly six months.
The other man was arrested right away.
The other one went to church, but later the man was found using a forest police force.
Men are suspicious of the use of motorcyclists, prisoners and broken injuries.
The police are grateful for the instructions.
Director of Research on Russia's change in leadership: Explaining the difference
Russia carried out a major change in leadership over the years when President Vladimir Putin separated his government from Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He's an ex-diplomat and worked as a two-man of Ivan.
Kangaspuro says that the reason why Ivanov's separation may be Putin's desire to prevent the strong people around him from collecting too much power.
He adds that the conversion of leadership is one way of administration.
This is a way to prevent people from telling independent Presidential authority to themselves.
It is also possible that Ivanov has been hurt or hurt by other leadership.
Asemanpudotus Ivanoville
Ivanov, a member of the small internal border, is moving to specific environmental and transport conditions.
By presenting the state media, Putin said that he was a joint decision.
Ivanov himself, according to the report, had asked to move to other tasks and proposed Vainoa to the situation, said Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that there is a clear consensus on the point of view of Ivanov.
Environmental and transport matters are not very high in Russia's important organization.
He notes that Ivanov has been one of the most important people in Russia.
Ivanov has also played an important role in the Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered possible as Putin's successor in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev rose as president.
Kangaspuro notes that the old card, such as government ministers, has recently been changed by Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the International Institute says that more interesting than Ivanov's location is that Putin changes its neighbourhood to a younger one.
Isis fighters used civilians in human trafficking in Syria
They used civilians to cross the city of Jarabulus so we wouldn't be interested in them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were transported to Jarabulus.
In the last week, Arabs and Kurds received about 90 percent of Isis' important Manbini city.
However, according to estimates, ten leaders remained in the city.
Earlier in the news at 19:30: In the past we mistakenly told the civilians that they were fleeing from the city, and that Isis fighters were really fighting civilians around the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior Documentary Line is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's line of documents is illegal, says Professor of Public Rights Tom Voutilainen, University of Eastern Finland.
Vuutilian tells the STT that the publication of documents cannot be based on the official's own lines, but it is based on the law.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs had previously refused to grant the Minister's list of opportunities for participation in the evening Sanomi.
The Minister based his decision on the Government Council’s guidelines and that the information had been written on the Minister’s calendar and not on the accounting material.
The Head of Communications of the Ministry tells the STT that there is a need to reform practices in the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rios.
In the last few years, Bolt's been running out of time.
He broke off his back from the beginning and had to leave behind the Japanese Olympics.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I'm much better.
I've been very well trained and it's open, Bolt said in a press conference in Rios.
That paper policy included small-scale Sambanese and adverted suppliers.
Porina Bolt’s area is underway by the fact that the Japanese star has risen as a time when the general riot has been fought with doping scandals and a riot of interest.
Bolt’s previous death in Olympics came to Athens in 2004, when he was 200 metres away at the beginning of the period of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young man's license that slowed down and found your place of practice.
Four years later, in Beijing, he began his power by hundreds of meters, where he suffered from the end of the world and the self-confidence of competitors at the time of his birth at 9.69.
This is harder.
A year later, Bolt arrived at the MMs in Berlin at the time of his wedding.
World events in Berlin are still in force at 9.58 per cent and 19.19 per second.
In Russia Bolt has announced its goal of 200 metres of global warming and 19 seconds of decline, but no one believes it to be more than Bolt himself.
Porta Bolt's greatest challenge is the 2004 Athens Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
In the last year of Beijing's MM final Bolt, only one hundred percent of Americans were born.
Bolt has not been destroyed at the beginning of Peking’s reign in the final stages of the values if you have just arrived on your journey.
In May 2011, one hundred MM finals remained in Boltland because of a volcanic eruption.
Bolt's going to complete the race after 30 weeks.
He's an old man of the kind of young men, and Rio's cats are his last Olympics.
For the last meal of Uranium Bolt has set up one year's MM classes in London.
These are the Olympics that separate me from my memory.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm down here, I remember myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the Sports Illustrate challenge.
Discoveries From Russia: two athletes suspected of doping
According to China State News Agency Xinhua, China's Chinese Prime Minister Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive example of doping in the Rion Olympics.
The Chinese doping sample of Chen Xiny was found after banned substances.
As well as the Bulgarians, Silvia Danekova is suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan general security guard was sent home because he gave a doping sample for a sportsman.
Silvia Danekova has been given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
He was placed in Rios for four quarters of women in a 100-metre-long line.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Stadado, the Chinese Prime Minister has brought his doping case to the attention of the International Court of Justice of Urheil.
Xinhua tells us that the display of Xinny on Sundays would have been marked by hydrochlorothiazide.
There have also been other doping days in Russia.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female surgeon Silvia Danekova has given doping samples with signs of epo hormone.
Kenya's gone home because of a doping.
The International Olympic Committee of the KOK told Torstana that the Kenyan manufacturer had been tested as an athlete and had given a doping sample for this.
According to media reports, there is Kenyan long-distance journalist John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had been using a 500-metre-long train pass by Ferguson Rotich.
Phelpsi doesn't stop anything - historical gold came into display style
As a successful Olympic player, Michael Phelps, U.S.A., took his 22nd Olympics in Rios by 200 meters.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympics.
At the same time, Phelps obtained the first summer of the same type of Olympic in the fourth consecutive season.
The Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino was placed in parallel before China's Wang Shunia.
I'm just trying to keep a little bit of fun, the BBC Olympic Commentary Helen Skelton's game in the long run of the night.
Helen Skelton (O.k.a.) is the most popular event this week on the Night's Eve website.
In the fourth comment, Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton does not have much stress if, at some point or in the British press, he has a small spot in his revealing and special place.
The TV is a visual media, he's stressing.
Skelton has been dressed in high-quality shoes and short skirts, which certainly has at least enough transparency - at least a number of conservative British eyes.
However, the rear axles are not allowed.
It's important to look good, and the little monsters are just fun.
Skelton certainly wants to relax and use fields, but he doesn't want to be in the head.
It's not about me. He's right.
There's a lot of sports here, and the focus must be on the athletes.
It shouldn't be as bad as I wear it.
Can you imagine that the court's been exaggerating until Finland?
I can't, but all that matters to me is how hard these vampires are doing tomorrow and how big they're making their sacrifices, it's okay for me, Skelton.
You know what?
It's empty if it's about to come up with ( June) clothes.
I've been interested in a little bit if this guy's been able to do some research.
Rion's police did two arrests because of a terrorist attack.
The Rion police reported to Torstana that it had arrested two people because of a terrorist attack.
The police took care of the case security.
At the same time, the police took five other arrests and heard two persons before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news station, the persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group that the police were already arrested in July.
Those who are held believe that they are in contact with the Isis.
Of course, the arrests were associated with violence in the social media.
The requested messages were published in the WhatsApp service, including the recommended ones.
The security of the Rion cheeses is responsible for 85 000 police.
The police fired a suspicious package in Rios
Spain and Nigeria had to start their initial study of the Rio Corps in an empty government tortoise.
The police found a suspicious package of corps and closed the place to the public.
The police got inside the public after the package was uncontrollable.
This was the third time in the Rion Olympics when the police were conducting a controlled explosion.
The police closed the arena because of the suspicious package found there.
The general came in when the police were uncontrollablely excavating the package.
The public did not prevent the search until the beginning of the arrest, as the police closed the arena because of the suspicious package found by the manager.
The police fired the package and saved the public's government after that.
The team woke up in a dream to start with the Spanish team.
On two deaths, Spain won Nigeria's 96-87 points.
In the two previous cases, Spain had gained hope.
The police conducted the third time they had control fire during Rio's lunch break.
Finally, the police had to launch a suspicious finding near the ground floor last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria began their work on the Rion Corps in front of the empty prospectors.
Argentinian lady dressed in a dress - Finnish face protest
The wind at Pettaj-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rios.
The wind of Pettaj-Sierre experienced severe storms.
Argentinian lady wore Tuul Petäjä-Sirini as a tortoise at the opening of the day of the women's surf.
The wind was clearly broken.
The respondent agreed to the strike.
He left because of the cholera, and others complained, the Finnish Chief of Staff Joakim Willenius told me.
The dancer considered the protest for a long time.
It was then not supported because it would have been a waste under the Olympic rules.
I should've thrown myself into the water so I could get a favor, you told me.
The Finnish broke down on the table until the last day because he didn't want to get Rion into the open water.
Finnish left the coral behind instead of 27.
In London the total number of Olympics in 2012 is eight.
The color of the needles didn't even affect it.
There's an important day on Friday when you leave 10-12.
Amended 0.39: No protests have been made from the first information except the Pettaj-Siren.
7 special matters that science believes will prolong
Science has explored everything possible between the earth and the universe.
These things have proved to be additional years in a person's life.
Some of these are practices that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so as to prolong his life.
Sometimes things that a person cannot personally affect can bring to him additional years of age.
Such are, inter alia, the degree to which the average cost is low or the social position.
Regular shopping can take a long time.
We don't have to break it up. We're just looking for enough milk.
The secret of long-term age has been trying to find out a lot of different research.
Medical Daily presented seven random findings.
According to science, all these things can bring more years of life.
Feeding of fish and coffee
Coffee has been found to protect some of the foods, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A study by Harvard University found that moderate consumption of coffee is related to "low risk of death", particularly with regard to neurological or cardiovascular diseases.
Further studies on alcohol suggest that exposure to one third of a day may prolong life.
For example, one found that winemakers live with their parents rather than people who don't care.
Regular oral use can prolong a person’s life even for more than six years, according to one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this is an obstacle to attitudes.
They can also promote the rest of other diseases in a person’s home.
A study conducted in Norway revealed how laughter affected one’s life.
For seven years, over 44,000 people have been studying the project.
Those who were more smiling were 35 percent more likely to be lonely after the end of the experience.
Sex, when the protection of sex is taken into account, many studies say that it is good for health.
Besides, it can also last a long time.
Unfortunately, just having sex isn't enough.
In order for a person to get more years of life, he must also get orgasm.
It's not going to be a competition.
However, long-term ageing does not require undue sobriety.
One study at Oxford University found that women with large spines had low cholesterol levels.
Their elimination also included more of their own 3 fatty acids.
The same study combined these causes with lower mortality.
Then there was an Olympic medalist or an actress who won Oscar, who was more likely to live longer than the usual doll.
A lot of research has been trying to find a reason for this.
One explanation may be that an honorable person is likely to live in a way that brings his life into additional years.
Some researchers also doubt that the long-term age is due to a person's social status - which also allows for, for example, the goal of recognitions such as Nobel Prize.
A study of over 65-year-old purchases found that the person buying daily is likely to pay the parent who buys less.
This is due to a reduction in individual sales turnover.
It has also been found to be biochemical mechanisms that may precipitate death.
So put your credit card in your hands - this is not how it's going to work.
The impeccable bike racer was hit by a truck
In the case of Varsinais-Sweden, a heavy truck and passenger car took place in the spring.
The accident took place in Koske, Koskenten and Sorvaston on the semi-finals at 2 p.m.
The truck had been in the past towards Forssa when the passenger car came against the same back, the part of the truck was on the right side.
The truck stopped after the explosion, but it started burning.
The driver succeeded in throwing the ball himself.
The car broke down and then I went over to the church.
In 1972, a woman who was born in a motor vehicle became a van.
The rescue plant dropped off the car of a broken driver, and he was transported to the central central bank of the market.
The result of a woman's oral examination was 2.02 promilla.
He's suspected of a broken cycle.
Mail sent out files to the wrong city
Salon K-City Market had a lack of out-of-court choice because the mail had been delivered part of the heavy damage to the Wall.
Teija Halti, who lives in the original town, was a tortoise buying out tickets from the Salon K-City market when it became fun with its eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies because Posti delivered our cargo to the Wall!
We'll get more when the mail gets delivered!
Well, if you're going to wear it in a nuisance, it's in your pocket.
The customer’s casing is related to the fact that your post-examinations last morning are also being served to deal with food shortages.
The food chain is always in the mail supply until the end of August.
I thought it was almost interesting and he decided to share it in the social media.
The recommendation of the day hit me outside.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention raised in this matter is incredible, Haltia is amazed.
On Friday evening, Haltian's day, there were more than 700 pieces on Facebook.
The holding received its own favor by tapping into the doorcarts, even though a few layers were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for the business of the Transport Services of the Postin Company, apologized for the damage to the Night Sanomi.
After all, from the fifth floor, the three of us went wrong to the wrong place (Sainjjöki) yesterday, and we were no longer going to take part in the three (Saloon), but we took only five stairs this day, Kaidisoja told the Night Sanomi.
It was the first night of the story.
Uncle Haltia didn't get excited about the cold because she found out to choose all her own irtocarcs.

Hope for a woman murdered in Lovis: Remembering the Victim for the Good of Police Corps
A week later, a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victims will be remembered for the good of the police.
The Sipoon Animal Medicines Agency has published a Facebook update that focuses on the benefits that the victim’s family hopes will receive from the police.
The publication tells us that the victim had done work in place of the animal doctor’s office and also performed medical training there.
The veterinary surgeon reminds you of the words concerning women.
Happy, smart, humorous and fearless.
Good friend.
Still, we can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes the account number where gifts can be transferred.
The update indicates that the grant funds are going in total to the police officers, primarily to secure procurement.
In the past few years, 42-year-old hunters have been killed in their own home in Loviissa Koskenkokenkyl.
The neighbors of the woman have told the victim of the night that the victim was very animalistic.
He owned a number of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, dogs and cats.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder knew no women and had nothing to do with each other.
The killer's follow-up included police officer Börje, who was killed in a life-threatening situation.
But Börje remained alive and is on his way.
The Court of First Instance ruled that the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction over the infringement of the uniformity law.
The post did not have the right to retain the remuneration of a worker who refused to hire a tenant, according to the Court of Justice of Kanta-Häme.
The Court of First Instance ordered that Post be paid to employees most of the remaining remuneration and EUR 2 000 for the benefit of the distribution.
According to the judgment, Post could have held only part of the employer’s salary, which would have been opposed to the entire day’s work.
According to the law of the Court of Justice, the employer had been established on the basis of a uniformity law on the basis of its professional integration as a more unfair position.
The staff members had followed the PAU's decision in the Post and Logistics Union.
During the post office in November last year, PAU made a decision that does not mean that the postal workers are not responsible for the illegal work of corrupt tenants.
He first told the People's News about it.
Turkey's path to respect for human rights
Turkey will have to return to the path of democratic and human rights- respectable development, writes Prime Minister Juha Sipil (Central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soin (p.) in response to the Journalist League.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soin (ps) agree on the situation of human rights in Turkey.
In its previous letter, the Journalist League asked Sipilä and Sonia to express their concern about freedom of speech and press.
Sipil and Seine repeatedly point out the importance of freedom of expression and expression to Turkey in Finland.
Putin separated his administration from the head of the department - the state official of Vaino
Russia's President Vladimir Putin has broken away from the presidential government chief Sergei Ivanov, Kreml.
The status will be presented by the President of the Council of the Council of Ministers, Karl Vain's son, Anton Vaino.
The disease is a 44-year-old diplomat who has served as the Vice-President of the Government since 2012.
A member of the Russian Security Council will also be involved in this incident, which is told by the Interfax News Agency.
Vladimir Putin gave the bullet to the head of his government.
Ivanov, which is part of the narrow internal border, is transferred to specific environmental and transport conditions according to the Kremlin report.
In short, Ivanov himself had asked to move to other tasks and proposed Vainoa's status, Russia Today tells me.
Ivanov worked together with Putin during the Soviet Union at the KGB headquarters.
Many viewed Ivanavia as a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but as President Dmitri Medvedev.
Ivanov was appointed as President in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: Manu's waste project for fear - not seen in the opening of the Valioliiga
The world's football racers are not seen in the field when the English elections were launched on weekends.
Paul Pogban's scarf followed in England.
The Manchester Unit's abandoned project, Paul Pogba, is due to fear when ManU opens its way against Bournemouthia every Sunday, told BBC.
Manu paid to the British press 105 million euros from Pogba in Italian for Youth.
However, the English football league FA keeps him out of the game because Pogbal has become a hero since Christmas.
He received two warnings in the last time in the Italian Cup, and that's what happens to one take-off.
That game was transferred to England, the FA told BBC.
The next port of Pogban is on the other side on 19 August, when ManU is located in Southampton.
It's a good thing that you're in Flow.
The precise criteria for lateness and dignified views have been confirmed as an international event of the status of the Flow Festival, which is celebrated by the world's top performers.
The Flow Festival starts on Fridays in Helsinki.
Festerers are typically dressed in their own dress.
One of the main artists is this year's punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is also set up by technicians and art installers.
We've never had enough to be just a ship and a diver, says the event's artistic director Tuomas Kallio.
In Helsinki Suvilahde this weekend, the Flow Festival has grown to be a small cardlife for tens of thousands of tourists.
As a result of the loss, there is a simple question: How would the authors like to go?
In case of accident, it's time to think this way.
Often the aim is to achieve the level of necessity and to be provided in accordance with the rules of authority, says the event's artistic director Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before it happened that Flow was going to sell this year.
The goal has been to raise the number of 70,000 people in the last year by 5,000 spirits.
Festivals also feature a group of interesting domestic and foreign artists this year.
The growth of tourism is a good thing because making has to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point there would be as much as a carnage led by a powerful storm.
That's not what we want.
The success of ideologies has been compared for 13 years with the presence of 130 artists, artists, and numerous restaurants and drinks bars.
In addition to the main and smaller exhibition halls, this year 15 000 people's rooms are in use.
It is dear to me to admit that the event could be more simple.
Maybe I'm a little bit too big, but at the same time we've been able to keep Flow's spirit.
If it disappears, this isn't our business anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work that has been done is that today the greatest sights are actually possible.
In the early 2000s, half-life action was very dependent on the support of about EUR 20 000 in the city of Helsinki.
In the last year, the turnover of the company operating in Flow was about EUR six million.
It allows for "more serious cases", such as the implementation of a 73-metre wide roof.
Flow's visitors are typically aired by their own self-contained dress.
On the wall of the music scene, you can also talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been clearly profiled as a particular form.
We want to get separated first by everything.
Nevertheless, the formation sciences also fit into the world of Flow's appreciation: the hate and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the leading artists is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a large fan group in his own generation, but he has indiorcky, pop music, rap and solo at a festival that combines it with all the typical performances.
Iggy's been shot because it's probably the last time it's seen everywhere in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
Not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's last cover is the best of his own, and he's done the best of his last few years.
The bomb of the Thai tourist paradise had been hidden in the catechisms - tourists were fleeing in terror.
In China, Hua fired a local time in the morning tortoise two bombs.
At least one local woman died and more than 20 were injured.
The bomb was apparently seized by a band of insects and fired by the sensors.
Bombs were placed on a street where most customers are foreign.
They were fired at the same time that the tourists began to leave their bars and return to their hotels, according to police representative Samuer Yoosumra CNN.
Since 1989, wildlife conservationist Edwin Wiek in Asia has tweeted a multi-language picture.
If the tweet doesn't look good, you can see it from this.
There were at least 11 foreign tourists in Hua, China.
He said that the bomb had exploded at the edge of the bar.
It happened one of the biggest baracies, told Swedish tourists Emilie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, local time, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of victims is not known yet.
Shortly after this, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket.
Of course nobody died.
At the same time, another double pump was made in Hua Chinese.
At least one died and three were injured.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police told me they found Hua Hini, of course, at least one bomb that had not yet been triggered.
According to the Thai authorities, behind the bombs are probably the main groups that are not satisfied with the activities of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organizations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been seriously involved in the activities of human trafficking criminal organizations.
KSML: This part of the new preparatory groups is due to war in the first place
In an acute war situation, alert men are ordered to combatants only several months after a military coup is taken, says the Central Finnish.
According to Jukka Sonnisen, the primary education officer of the defence forces, for example, is the only ones who are in the final stage of their training, for example, five and five months in the armed conflict.
According to the Training Officer, the service shall first be designated as a reserve belonging to the preparatory groups.
No guardian or reserve officer shall be charged with any responsibility for which training has not been required, Sonnine says.
In the past, it has been shown that defence forces are engaged in training emergency preparedness units from the beginning of the first year.
If necessary, units may be used in military operations already during emergency training.
Pamela Tola received leave payments from the hotel
As an example of Pamela Tola and her former husband, the supplier leader Pauli Waroma have won a rare apartment that they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The retail price of the two cross-sectional apartheid was EUR 330,000.
However, after trade, a serious complication arose in the home, which led to a health threat of microbiotic growth.
In 2014, Paris had to sell the apartment as a garbage dump.
The sales price had risen to EUR 132 000, so the economic loss to Tola and Waroma had been reduced to EUR 198 000.
The Paris Group took the matter to court and asked for a price flight.
The sellers violated the requirement, but Tola and Waroma won the case, both in the courts and in the courts.
The Court ruled on the matter as a matter of midweek.
It was in force to the judgment of the Court of First Instance which ordered the seller to pay to Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for price flights.
In addition, the seller has to compensate for the costs of law enforcement and disclosure of the parity of EUR 47 344.
The right to a low price flight was justified because some of the same housing needs had already been in the knowledge of the buyers in dealing with the sale of the dwelling.
However, according to the case law, the apparent structural defects were substantially more serious than those indicated.
The hotel's looking for a welcome home
Tola told the court that the parishioner had been looking for an approved home because they did not want to make any adjustments.
He had been born with the idea that the building was well-established and well-founded and that there is no harm to the buildings mentioned in the civil investigation report.
The public inspection report indicated that there was a risk and indirect climate change and that it was not sufficient to cover long-distance drinking water management.
However, on the basis of the discussions there was no indication that this would have been a matter of urgency.
Tola and Wararo remained convinced that the future of precious seeds might have to be guided a little over a few years.
The goods were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became evident that the housing costs were much more serious.
In 2012 and 2013, inspections carried out on the structure showed microbiotic growth, which was based on evidence, both on high water and capillary rise in soil.
On the west side, the air pollution of the house of the microbe may have been considered by the inspector by means of a baptism into the interiors as well.
A possible health risk, cross-border values or cloud were found in public exhibitions of the home, the basement portal, the living room window, and the basement bathroom.
The terraces were built without permission
In the case of justice there was also a dispute as to whether the apartment was extended against the construction permit.
The Court found that Tola and Waroma had not been aware of the decision of the city of Espoo before the sale, which allowed the apartment to make the opposite changes.
Among other things, the terraces had been built even though there had been no suitable ceiling.
However, home problems were the main issue in law.
According to the Court of Justice, the purchasers were likely to sell before the sale on the basis of the information they received, assuming that the construction was applicable to such housing and that there was no need for a measure of correction in the near future.
Tola and Waroma had no special reason to carry out a more extensive examination of the case law.
The buyers are not deprived of their responsibilities, the Court of Justice shall have jurisdiction.
Hard record: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to their children - also in Finnish registers
In his youth, Christopher Andersson writes in his article Dagens Nyheter, how the National Archives of the United States in Maryland has recorded documents on microfilms for a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are Germans, but they are also American, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, the Nazis wanted at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women.
Documents and registration cards are originally from the RU Office operating in Nazi Germany.
The Rotu Office works under the direction of SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was able to acquire children before he had been studied by an SS doctor.
The same was true of women who were supposed to be able to produce even more than 10 children.
According to Anderson, women were subjected to gynaecological research to find out.
The Rotu-British Bureau identified the results of women, including by examining church literature.
The purpose was to ensure that women were not Jewish in sex.
Women also had to be willing to make a dedication to Sweden’s citizenship, to give the red tape to the Rotary Office, as well as to make good recommendations to the neighbors.
The Rotu Office wanted to point out that women were "children", "saves", and "good civil society" who were very involved in Germany.
Women who did not comply with the requirements were not accepted as nurses by the SS.
The account does not tell us how 14 Finnish men found in the archives.
The SS leaders set up a government support programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The programme included the provision that each SS man should receive four children, either in or outside the marriage.
The Lebensborn families take care of their children and their mothers outside the marriage.
However, the programme has not been very actively promoted, the United States of America's credit institutions are being told.
Instead, the nation's population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by providing loans and supporting children.
The honorary president of the German mother was granted to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's pages are confirmed.
As a traitor-Sierre's sixth, Nirkko got up and fell
Tapio Nirkko was placed as a third pass from the first day of Finnjolli on the Rion Olympics, but he remained the whole team on the second day.
Nirkko grew up in a total of eight hundred after five years, but the failure of another was replaced by 14.
In the early 17th and third days of the RS:X class.
There's six of them at Pettaj-Siren's office.
In 470th class, Jonas and Niklas Lindgren stayed at the beginning of the day 23.
The Lindgrins are in place.
Jari Sillanta's satellite had a couple of hours of fun at night: "I was so tired"
Jari Sinlanpä has been a member of the Finnish Volunteers for more than 20 years.
From the cruise ship's barge in 1995 as a tanker, Finland's best seller as a solo artist, as well as for the dance boats and festivals, Silanpea has continued to push forward and is currently on its way up.
By Mari Kopissen, a book about the life of the poet Jari Sillanpä - Paljaana was published today in Torstana.
In the book of Silas, we read about his life and his death in both good and bad.
On the other hand, the young man rose to a true rise when he won his Tungsten crown at the Montenegrin Wall market in 1995.
At Kisa, Sillanpea sang songs, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the summer of 1995, Jukka Kupuppamäki had gathered a man's request to the head of Sillan, which Kassu Halonen agreed in a slightly different form.
On Saturday, the concert was one of the most popular events in the history of Finland.
However, the book says that the vote did not go exactly according to the plan: The king sang it in a strange crater and only a few hours later.
We had a party tonight.
I was in such a hurry!
The head of the coin is remembered in the book.
As a mighty man, you would not immediately think that it was sung in the cupboard.
Although I wasn't physically the best, it was still good.
I learned that all the time, I don't have to ask myself to be perfect and superior.
The accident of another man’s best friend, mentioned in the book, took place about a decade later.
In 2013 Sillanupé broke away from his partnership and eventually ended the case You deserve the gold cup texts that were published alone in 2014.
The book says that Sarah’s Song of Solomon was not as desirable as the Song of Solomon.
The poet had imagined that he was making a book that tells the truth about his own life, but the words he told from the beginning were not true, but it had been written on the basis of a news report of the 7 - day magazine.
In the newspaper, Jarin and the ex-racana were told that Jarin was too drunk to celebrate and alcohol use, but Jarin said it was full of poppy and did not have his place.
According to the book, Jari called on the radio and refused to sing from the chapter, but finally he decided to sing it - and so on.
In June the British were surprised by the vote of their nation outside the EU.
At the end of 52% of the voters were different and 48% would have stayed in the Union, although the polling week's opinions predicted the opposite outcome.
The British economists and the economic institutions were almost single-mindedly based on their survival in the EU.
No respected research institute or university has moved on account of the difference, even though a few individual researchers felt different from the authority of their profession.
The theme "It's the economy, stupid" of the US election campaign by former President Bill Clinton on the subject "It's the economy, stupid" was launched in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were upset when they didn't hear their voice.
They were disappointed when the economy did not seem to be the most important issue of politics.
Economical kiara language
The Centre for Macroeconomics will have a response to the Brexit disaster during its last month of operation.
The typical answer is that economics were not heard because this time the voters made a decision on other than economic grounds.
One economic explanation for the loss of economic position is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still imagine that the number of jobs is independent of the number of workers, almost certain.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's right out of Britain.
Many also have the view that the calculation of the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes export industry.
In the opinion of the economic community, the voters did not believe in economic arguments because economic unity was insufficient.
In particular, they were exploited by the level playing field of BBC, which gave only a few percent of the EU's economic community support to economic scientists as well as the overpowered majority.
The EU's hate paper was not interested in how different the impact of IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic capital systems are.
These far-reaching written systems have been talking about economic growth, trade relations, state policy and currency.
And if economic messages were heard and understood, they were ignored because economicists represent an elite with whom voters do not think they are of common benefit.
Academies such as economics would have remained in the EU but did not act in small towns and rural areas.
Agriculture is also an economy
The overarching argument of Brexit's vote on immigration has been a win-win argument.
The immigrant takes your place at work, the immigrant burns your patient, the immigrant uses you to accept you.
These arguments went wrong.
Every coffee has foreign workers.
How many more jobs in Britain would have been if they had gone away?
In the waiting room of each health centre there are immigrants.
How much easier it would be for the British to take medical time if they weren't?
Every school has the children of immigrants.
How much easier it would be for British children to get a place of school if they got separated from them?
In each country, foreigners live in it.
How much more would the originals be if they disappeared?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economics have not been able to respond to them, and if they have succeeded, their response has not been visible.
Economicists have not been able to explain that because of immigrants, the British have more jobs, less health centres and more money for education and social security.
Migrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net taxpayers of the British public economy and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen's state-of-the-art government saved Brexit's hand
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, which corresponds to the Finnish authorities Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, in Aberdeen, plans A and B were made for Brexit in times.
Plan B, the EU-supporting line, was launched for more than a few weeks before the vote in order to ensure that the outcome would be complete.
It was worried that investors would start taking their money out of the market.
The state-owned banks do not normally have a reasonable amount of cash, but they may now be needed.
We're going to raise our hands.
When Brexit happened on day 23, we had 25 percent of the investments in cash or cash, Vanhanen says that Aberdeen's only openings are marked daily from the state-of-the-art fund that the news is dealing with.
According to the old man, normal levels would be 15-20 per cent.
At the time, the value of the money was 3.5 billion pounds.
The total value of the company's funds is about 20 billion pounds.
It was the highest number in the nine open buildings, Vanhanen says of all the open buildings in the UK.
He estimated that the lower hand rate in these funds remained ten per cent or even below.
Thus, the state-owned governments were very different in Brexit's strategy.
The funds closed the trade
When the EU won the battle against the scourge, Europe went into chaos.
However, two weeks after the vote on the real estate market were very peaceful, Mr. Vanhanen said.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the president of the central bank of England, Mark Carney, who felt that Brexit could be at great risk to business firms.
In addition, the first of the fixed-rate banks, Standard Life, has been frozen in its marketing process.
Together, they took a look at the situation and addressed the main issues of the Financial Time and BBC.
The situation was compared immediately in 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This got investors into trouble.
The institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Lumippalo began to cycle, and the fund was to close its door after the other one.
Aberdeen’s situation was good for collected funds, but it had to be frozen for six days.
According to the old man, they were not actually closed to trade, but they changed prices below.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether they now support money to lead to panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't work because it would cost you money.
It calmed the situation, and most of the people started reporting.
After that, it was quite equal, and now the market has been very peaceful for a few weeks, Vanhanen's story.
He notes that, for example, Aberdeen Manner-Europe has had nothing to do with death.
However, a lot of questions came up.
Immediate attention to the housing industry
In the old opinion, the closures of the sale of fixed-exchanges have received little undue attention.
The open funds covered by the closures are managed by about four per cent of the British units.
Aberdeen’s lock lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from its 80th estate in London.
Some other funds are still locked up.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it could hold its funds by the end of 2017.
At this moment, there is uncertainty, and economic growth has been reduced below, but the situation does not appear to be "increasing".
The biggest issues now relate to the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought to the attention of some of the local authorities even new opportunities, Mr Vanhanen.
The red and dollar rate is the lowest for 30 years and the market has a 15% discount for the time before Brexit vote.
The dollar owner can now buy the same property by up to 30 percent less.
There's a lot of wanted buyers, Oldman says.
Brexit brought discounts to London's real estate market
At two in the morning, the situation didn't seem very positive.
But four times, when Pertti Vanhane, who was responsible for the construction of the headquarters of the British Building Board of Director Aberdeen Asset Management, returned to see the results of Brexit's vote, the situation was different.
By the time you got there, you got it.
I realized that this is going to be on the B side of the plan, Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He was going to work right away.
London City was already completely alive in the morning.
In the process, the TV channels that were normally unvoked knew the news, and usually the crowd was very late to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron arrived early in the morning to tell the camera about the rent.
When the markets opened up, the showcases seemed to be just red.
It was a morning that would never have believed in his life, Oldman said.
This is not why, despite myllery, Aberdee, one of the UK's largest steel industry, last day after Brexit's vote, the two steel trade.
The tunnel was so cool.
However, the company had been well-equipped for an alternative, and that is why the situation was in a peaceful manner, according to Oldman.
Brexit's vote started with the correction movement
The vote was followed by the mayor.
Ponta Romana, the British leader went to exchange.
The market began to predict limits to the UK and in particular to the London real estate market.
In London, even 20% of the reductions were expected in the coming years.
A small group of British state governments began to freeze their trade after each other.
Aberdeen made it for six days.
Now the plant's broken down, but there's still uncertainty in the air.
It really doesn't see the last summer of this week in the old days in Helsinki.
He still thinks it's too long to say much about what happens to Brexit.
So much is still open: how different it is and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
First information on the development of the London real estate market has already been received.
CBRE’s CBRE’s information on price developments covers about three thirds of the market.
According to them, prices for all units in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, the interest rate was 6.1 per cent, according to Vanhanen's list.
The bones aren't so terrible, but they're moon changes.
The monthly index was released in 1987, and in just five months there have been worse numbers, says Vanhanen.
All the same major outbreaks occurred in 2007 and 2008.
It is therefore interesting that Brexit was compared to the fall of Lehman and the beginning global economic crisis in the US.
In the old opinion, the comparison is not quite the case, because now there is a British domestic crisis.
There's another tunnel.
The real estate market has now not seen the likes of that period but the desire to sell more liquidity, says Vanhanen.
It's normal to find funding.
Corrections could have been in any case
Actually, the price adjustment team isn't a miracle for him. This could have been before without Brexit.
According to the Aberdeen estimate, the prices of municipalities in London and other parts of the world have been too high for years.
We've been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overrated, says Vanhanen.
That's when the bottle started really high.
The prices in London have fallen for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strong, and so has the people of London.
Another major trend is that the properties are the last category of property that is globalised, says Vanhanen.
In the Middle East and Asia, new operators have come into the market, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for housing jobs abroad.
London is known as the city's easy spot.
In addition, prices have risen to a low level, which has led, for example, to search for products from new points of view.
The loan has been easily available - even if it has been used according to Old Age, it is now clearly less than during the 2008 crisis.
Get out! Get out! Get out!
The rise in prices in London last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also began to simplify its properties in London, and there were net sales last year.
There was some kind of translation waiting for you, and now it's coming.
What's in front of this?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhan says.
He doesn't believe in the future, but he says there's no way of getting up.
The sensor indicates that there is a downward or even going forward.
The old man has seen several movements up and down since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the dead will be found out by work.
If you're well prepared for risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in globalization.
If you've invested in the single market, it's too much of a victim.
If it's spread, the risks are spread too, says Oldman.
The S group will start registering the purchase information more carefully before
The S Group knows what you are eating, because my trading group told me today that it was starting to collect more detailed information about the purchases of its customers.
By the time the information has been collected from the end of May, the group will begin to waste it from the products purchased as well.
The S group will come after Kesko because the information on the goods purchased on plus cards has been collected in the Kesko customer register for a few years.
According to K-Plus Oy, the return from the programme was mainly of benefits.
The product details shall be collected with the consent of the customer and shall be used as a marketing authorisation.
The most effective channel is e-mail.
When a rare customer has denied the use of product information, Ritala tells the economy.
According to him, Kesko is not going to react to the change in the S-group registration.
The centre is already classing its client into ten groups according to just the food units.
The classification shall be updated monthly.
The number of purchases and the amount of money used are also classified by the customer.
The information shall be used for the marketing of the client.
The product-specific purchase information shall be collected only from the K Group's own boxes.
Co-operation partners, for example, Neste Oil are not created.
Lidl Finland does not have a stand-alone programme and does not have such a set of plans.
Finland’s Near Trade has its Unkösbonus side client programme, which can be connected to the Elections, the Sivows and the Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect product or product-group information, we remain as high as the final level.
But we know where the purchases were made and I'm on the day and I'm the customer's final.
We haven't gone to the level like K-group or S-group, says business leader Anu Ora.
According to him, the stand-alone programme is intended to continue to reform, but the Middle East will tell you about it later.
However, Ora does not allow the registration of the product data to be started.
The test shall be performed at the start of the test.
Sok’s customer and customer register has been relatively wide up to this point.
In addition to personal and address information, basic information has also been included in vocational training, housing and child birth years and previous personal data.
Individuals belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
S-Etukukortiosto has been recorded on the date and time of purchase, location, termination of purchases and payment.
In addition, information from the S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cassette systems.
From the beginning of May, the purchase information for the product is stored in Sokos and Emotion boxes.
Instead, data on S-markets, Prismos, Kodokon Terro and ABC are recorded at the second level of product.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that the market could be better placed, says the head of the SOK client and partnership of Marjaana Saarikoski.
The S-group says it's about changing its information to customers.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data on the market.
However, the data are recorded in case of any case, whether or not I wanted it.
The request may be verified on the S Group’s website.
For example, cash is not available for information, stressing Saarikoski.
Video: The Heila Pentu is the newest dog breeder - the pen becomes the first explosion
The Black Labradorinator's pendulum is roughly five of the same country's railway station in Helsinki-Vanta airport.
It won't be long when it's definitely sitting next to the middle class.
The customs officer Lassi Suntio will pay for his heila dog by playing it with its pleasure.
From the building that was next to Heila, there was a hole in a hole in the hole.
Rutikagasu is the first joke that has been practiced with Heilan now, says Suntio, owner of Heila Dog.
Security situation and network traffic
They are the first to find a specific dog for weapons and explosives in the Customs area and it is set up to work at the Helsinki-Vanta airport in the first year.
The tasks may also be carried out by Heilan and Sunton to other border areas and ports.
However, the airport must be the main place of work for Heila because the international security situation has changed because of the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Court of Justice of Paris and Brussels has confirmed the measures taken in the Customs and after the hearings, says Inspector Mikko Grönberg.
The second access to training for arms and explosives in Customs is through the mail from Helsinki-Vanta.
As a result of growing internet trade, even 40 million mail shipments are carried out each year through the airport, which may include foreign-owned equipment and explosives.
Customs has been carried out in the last few years by the Helsinki-Vanta airport of a group of net trade purchases, travel goods and aircraft for some 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their source materials.
Heila is going to work on various parts of Helsinki-Vantaata.
It will have to examine written travel goods and mail.
In the future, it will be a great benefit when it can be used through large county areas and select regions that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
On the basis of their performance, Customs assesses whether more weapons and explosives are being trained in the future.
Grönberg has a positive attitude toward the idea.
School in the Church
The training of the Heila-Penn is the coordination of the Customs School for Dogs located in Kirkkonum.
The Union is also involved in training with Heilan for the creation of police and defence forces experts.
Police have a strong experience in training dogs and awareness of explosives by defence forces.
The customs shall decide together with other authorities what difficulties Heila is being taught to bear witness.
They're always going to continue school as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues in Helsinki-Vantalla are the six drugstores and the money and drugstore Mass.
Labradorinator Heila has been selected from ten dogs' penthouse.
The choice of the dog to be selected for the flight consists of boredom and deforestation as well as peace because it is made with weapons, explosives and human beings.
Heila, who lives in the house of Sunon, is a close employee of the customs officer, but also a family member.
There's nothing without Heila coming home, Suntio's laughing.
The great orders go to Heila from the back of the storybook.
The cameraman of the night-sanomis quickly loses some protection for the dog, but Heila is returning from the softness of the play from the "out" window.
Competition in the labour market
Heila's primary school will be completed in the first year.
There are still tax assessments, followed in October which assess whether training is sufficient for required work.
Heilan can see the work in Helsinki-Vantaall for the first time in a year if everything goes according to the plans.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to wear a dog on the staff, remembering Suntio.
The cost of one job is about EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their work is about seven to eight years, even ten years later, after which they will be able to take care of their own.
The working days may be longer than eight to ten hours, but active hours last only ten minutes for a couple of hours.
The owner of the workers is a tough competition in Customs.
Heila's owner is looking for about 20-30 Customs employees.
I'm happy to meet Sunton, who has never had a job before, but he has years of experience in dogs and surveillance activities in Customs.
The minority gets its first Olympics - its people get a day off
Under millions of Fijian Olympics in Ruggy are valued in the country so high that the government has declared 22 August as a national holiday.
According to the country's radio society, the Fijian government has confirmed the decision on mastership.
The day of the holiday is to be held at the group's home on the next day.
The Sancary Party also has a permit to celebrate Christmas at home.
Fiji's gangs are celebrating the master's party.
The Guardian reports that there was a fine follow-up in the capital of Suvalla, where the stadiums were equipped with a screen.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game together with our monocultural community.
Even in the Chinese industry, I heard they were encouraging, says Fiji Times provider Maikele Seru Guardian.
Dramaaa Riosa - The Finnish founder turned after the storm
For example, after a severe battle of 175 kilograms, the weighted figure was Milko Tokola.
Tokola has special and life-threatening properties.
During or after the rise of the arms, he has been turned several times.
No one's really been able to say why.
Tokola got a job in Russia as a result of 175 kilos and 145 kilos of electricity.
He had a total of 200 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his job at the last 155 pounds [175 kg], as well as elsewhere.
In the third business, stress rose as a result of a sudden turn of events.
Cropa was released under pressure until the court accepted a stand.
The Finnishman's pleasure is that he's been suffering from lung cancer.
RoPS acquisition virolaiser Prosan - With a vacuum cleaner - Night-Sanomat
Rovaniemen Paloseura, who plays in the football field of men, has made a long-term formalist with Albert Prosa.
We're looking for a team member who has an active role and who's driven to come to Finland and Rovanjem is small.
We went through 50 players across the world with more than ten players.
The group of small shelters began to give a good opportunity to Prosa, the manufacturer of RoPS, Dr. Juha Malinen, told us.
Prosa, 25, gets RoPS from Flora, where he made 109 seizures on 51 May.
He's also played in the Viron.
Prosa is intended to be with RoPS already on Saturday at the Seinjajjjj, where Russians meet the ruling Finnish Master of the SJK.
RoPS was required for a new attacker when Aleksandr Kokko recently moved to Australia.
The threat of Modern Family re-position: the shorts of the act reveal almost everything
The modern family come to be known as Alex Dunphyn, a co-commediate friend, by Ariel Winter, once again, by reproducing his reputation.
Winter was portrayed in Hollywood this week in ministers' voices that don't leave much of their imagination behind.
The shorts revealed not only the feet of the exhibitor but also the back of this side.
18-year-old Winter has recently raised its attention by changing its style and its use considerably stronger.
The star has emerged in a social media publication in pictures of very small clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressed in very thin places.
Winter, at the age of ten, has recently published several pictures of herself at the festival.
If you don't see a picture, you can see it from here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its public image so radically.
The founder of PowerwomenTV and supplier Amy Palmer doubted that Winter had a "typical Hollywood transformation" for children.
He's been on television for almost his entire life and grew up in the times of the Kardashians.
He has learned that what more appears to appear on the surface, more publicity and attention in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has seen countless stories before.
Winter started in the modern family line when he was only 11 years old.
The indicator has highlighted some of its long-term fans in image transformation.
It's not hard to think where he's ten years old when the bottom is so hard now, to realize a woman in Winter Instagram.
Some of the women's fans instead defend the actor and call for immediate criticism.
You look great!
That's exactly what others say.
You're an inspiration to a lot of women, to blow a young woman.
Japanese would like to see Northern Finland - tourists swimming on the return route: Syksysin is able to see the port of the Mirro aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to encourage the Japanese to start the Revolving Centres from the beginning, Visit Finland tells you in a message.
The main objectives of the Japanese Revolving Visit are Inari and Levi.
Revolves are our winter trip cards, and they are strongly combined into the countries of the heart and lungs.
There's a lot to ask for on the cheap return trips, but now we're trying to increase the sales of cheap travel.
It's rare to know that the revolving zone is starting from the early autumn and is going on for a long time.
The reason for this is that it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the phenomenon of two times as many as possible, says Visit Finland's market manager Anne Lind in a report.
Visits to the main team of the Finnish Revolving Company are 25-35 years old, Japanese people living in the cities, benefiting from travel and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, including the online country.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from the Aalto University and the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptional strong and positive image of Japan compared to other Nordic countries.
The Japanese would, however, need more clear perspectives than Finland, and there is a great potential for this referendum, according to Lindin.
The nights of Japanese tourists have increased in Finland in other Nordic countries more clearly.
Last year they slept in Finland more than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finnish travel as they used over EUR 80 million in Finland.
The average Japanese used EUR 183 per day in Finland, Lind says.
Brittany had to be satisfied with her hope at the Ruggy-7 class when the Fidz team won gold
The success of the seven players in the turnby class in East Britain was devastating when Fidzi won it in the tournament at the finals played at the Rio Deodoro stadiums, chapters 43-7.
Fidzi gave the master's teaching in palliative treatment, movements, side movements, support games, runnings and raisins, and won the gold – if the country had the first Olympics of its history.
The losses meant hope, which was a little much more relaxed for Britain, because it was the third hope of the country on the same day. They can be proud of their success as Olympics in the first round- 7 tournament in which the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The strong victory of the South African Boxes on the same day in the 7-5 semifinals was likely to have a negative effect on the group's membership in the finals.
Despite this, the group of Fiji would have won the British in this form, although the group of 15 would have been in full power.
It can bring comfort to Britain that at least one Britt gets his own gold medal tomorrow: Chief of Fiji Ben Ryan, former English recruiter from Wimbledon.
It's been quite an experience for Britain.
Eight years ago they destroyed Ryan's production of all the games in Adelaide Sevens market.
In Russia they destroyed only one game.
The loss makes it hard, but progress is urgent.
Fidzi began with a remarkable initiative and presented his bids to the British Isolle for interest.
It seemed as if Captain Tom Mitchell's team material had broken down into a group of moving line cars, and the world's masters rose from 5 to 0 when Osea Coliniseu made an explosion.
When there were four minutes in the clock, Jerry Tuwai made another floor right on the ground floor.
The situation was 12 to 0, and the United Kingdom had probably hit the ball.
Mitchell's great effort was to make a third ground for Leon Nakarawa, but it soon slowed down Fitz's move.
When the game was played for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalu made the map right to the top of the ground, after which Britain was 17 to 0 at the end.
Nakarawa made a second stage of the continuation, during which the first half of the game was still more than a minute away.
After this, Vatemo Ravovovu attacked the Iso-British group through the most powerful tanks and over the painting line.
After the earthquake, the opening period ended in 29 to 0.
It turned out that the Fijians are like born to play seven players' rupees while the British are still in the role of the student.
Which has a lot to do with his place.
Britain made extensive changes in half and managed to keep the Fijians in full four minutes, which was a good performance for the first half of the time until Joshua Tuisova made the land by means of a great group of Fijians.
Dan Norton managed to entertain the situation by making it to the left corner of the land of the Iso-British, but the game had long been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose fans in the view of singing were laughing and dancing.
It was hard to be surprised at seeing Fidz's clean and clean attitude.
Mata Vilame made the final car by making the finish of the Fidillas by making the painting at the last minute.
The picture was so vivid, the Fijians were suffocating each other, and the British fell into the field, completely mutilated.
On a more recent day, Fiji had won Japan's semifinals from chapters 20 to 5 and the United Kingdom had been retreated to the end of South Africa at the end of the semifinals in which it would resolve the British continent.
Kyle Brown took South Africa's Boxes with his first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line by his feet and ate from the top of the ground floor by the other half.
Marcus Watson, who is a member of the 15-player team of players in England, was the brother of Anthony Watson, who won the prize and finally won the championship.
The war against food by the preparations encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to fight gold
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
From the first voyage to the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, 220 winners in the history and found more purpose for the gold at the moment in Estacio da Lago.
Although there were two of them, all three of them in the sea, the third producer, Robin Williams, who encouraged them to another generation of Olympics in the two women. This makes them the first women in the history of the British Games who marvel at the corresponding achievement.
Their survival was unwarranted, their victory was 39th in succession and once again prophetic.
What we see, two wonderful athletes joining the water level as you grew up, is not entirely in line with the nature of success.
However, there are a large number of assistants who have brought two of them to their arrivals. However, the assistants are the most important manufacturers who were diagnosed with food 30 months ago and who did not then know if he would see this day.
According to William, the situation was difficult at the time.
"I had a spinal cord and grew up able to break out.
Without interruption, it would've spread to everyone.
And the situation would have been a long time ago.
It changes a little bit of thought."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The third was lucky that Williams was able to start his treatment outside of the season in early 2014, when the interruption caused the least harm if it is now possible to say in these circumstances.
"I needed money, so I had to improve quickly.
It works as an encouragement.
I was in the hospital and walked about six feet [6.9 m] and 15 m] each time they said there were several steps needed.
That's where it starts.
The war itself is already on its way, but this has made it a little bigger."
Unhappily after the victory, two thoughts were in Williams, who had delivered a heartbreaking morning and spoke a bit more normal in trying to overcome their own apathy.
Mr. Staning, President of the British Royal Psychiatry, who had a backyard in Afghanistan, says: "I've been at the level of consciousness this week, which may be a little extreme, but it means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we have worked with Helen and Robin.
The last three years of Helen's and Robin's case have been fantastic.
Without Robin we wouldn't have anything, so thank him so much, he's the world's best maker.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to train with or a better cook."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
Both have found a superpowered race for which their competitors have not succeeded in taking comparisons.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the two of us started approaching New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
"We've been very close for a while.
And Helen, "Pysy mukana, stay mukana."
It's very important that you don't get out of line."
"We succeeded in leaving well, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything wonderful.
We didn't aim for the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good fight and win the race we did."
They both think of a year before they decide their future.
Glover's party in the first month will be on the television show with Steve Backshall.
Now he just wants to enjoy a moment.
"I didn't mean to say this was my last competition.
It would have brought too much stress."
"After London it lasted about six months before I realized I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was really stressed out.
This time it took about four minutes to find out.
This feels so much better," she says.
Iceland exchanges Panamanian Government
In October, Iceland will organize the early parliamentary elections which the rebel opinionists of Panama's data years require in the winter.
The so-called Panamanian papers revealed the taxing of many Icelandic politicians using tax apparatus.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugson's divorce for scandal, but it didn't fit the opinion.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, then promised to arrange for new parliamentary elections.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how many people’s final limit will affect the outcome of the struggle.
In June the presidential elections were clearly marked by criticism of the rulings, and the president was elected by Gudni Johnson, who was placed outside the political system.
Trump said he was a hero, claiming to be the founder of Obama Isis.
The presidential vice-president of the United States, Donald Trump, launched his last trial.
He said he was very proud to say that President Barack Obama would be a terrorist organization founded by Isis and a democratic advocate for the establishment of Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party rejected the talks and asked for an apology from Trumpil.
The military commander should never let anyone who can push you down like that, Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the President of Cannes has banned the use of a popular Burkin-Murkin-Muslim in the U.S.U., including the British newspaper Guardian.
In a decision signed by Prime Minister David Lisnard, it is clear that it is forbidden to go to the coast and swim across all those who do not have a good way and respect for secularism.
The decision also states that drug use, which is largely religious, can increase the risk of organised disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-June 85 people died and hundreds died in Nizza when at the age of 31, a man took the French National Day to a leading force group.
At the end of July, two orphanages connected to Isis attacked the church in North France and killed over 80 years of age a priest.
The quality of drinking water of the river of Ouija board will pass through the river of Pykós
The water samples taken from the official coastal waters of the coast of the island comply with the quality requirements laid down by the river basin.
Only the Pykössørve has found a oil mine.
The Ouija board’s environmental action took heavy and medium-term water use during the Ouija board of nine EU-wide and 30 other general waterways.
In addition to the coast of the Mediterranean, the weights of all E.coli and soybean-based entero-coke bacteria in the marine environment have been reduced by the measures laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social and Health.
The levels of E.coli and enterococcical water in the marine basin were ensured as the average week in which bacterium concentrations were calculated under the measures.
The oil wells discovered by the canal of the canal are not yet waterless, but in favorable circumstances, the situation can be transformed rapidly into oil wells where the water is formed into a cooler floor.
The following state of the environment was reported for an inspection.

ICT demand for forest supply: Over 80 per cent of rural farmers outside
The reduction in forestry is one change in the budget proposal of the Ministry of State resources for the first year.
The tax on income is proposed for tax reductions which would be granted on the basis of the tax on the basis of the change in the natural habitat of the forest.
In the presentation of the Ministry of State Resources, the forest supply reduction has four objectives: to promote forest change, to improve the ageing of forest owners, to increase forest livestock and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote the forest economy of entrepreneurs.
The forestry operator would reduce the net income from the forest economy.
The idea of making such a work to promote forest change is well expressed by the comments made by the Director of Forestry and Forestry Union (MTK), Director of Forestry and Forestry (MTK).
However, the applicant finds a critical tax revenue.
The reduction in forest supply shall be submitted for the purpose of the net income of the forestry operator.
It is the capital income that has been reduced by all other reductions.
In the view of the MTC and Hakkarian, the tax reduction would be more effective if the reduction could be made directly from the sales of wood.
The VM’s presentation shows that reducing the net income of the forestry industry is prohibited by the fact that, on the basis of it, the loss of the capital income of the forestry sector should be reduced by other taxes.
Such a person would get tax benefits even if he doesn't sell.
It's a multiplicity.
The average forester is not able to fake it, Hakkarine says.
In addition, the model concerns only a small part of forest farmers.
The limit of tax reductions linked to forest production is EUR 40 000.
It has been brought to the attention of Hakkari's mind too high.
As a result, he said, 82 percent of Finnish foresters were excluded from the limit of reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10 percent of the forestry community, he says.
The VM considers that the limit is guaranteed without the objective of growing.
The forest policy has been undermining forest supply for decades according to Hakkaris.
The result is the ageing of the forest economy community.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is now more than 60 years, and about half of forest farmers are resident.
The powerful wall tower surprised the car owners in Himangala - two cars stuck to their door and pushed each other.
In Himangan, the fish caught a special catch on Friday morning.
According to the rescue facility, after two hours of driving, the car broke down into the door, after which you came back after a while.
According to the day-to-day palome Harry Pyhta, I'm going to have a suspicion of a powerful coup d'état.
In the past, there were two people in the car who were both transported to the hospital.
There's no more precise information about their complaints.
In the past, the car driver didn't give up.
The accident was struck by a government of 8 Himangan over a few kilometers.
Finnish research can help to improve the effectiveness of food treatments
Young researchers at the University of the Market may be helped to develop more effective nutrition treatments.
The findings of the Ivaska research team, Professor Johanna Akathemya, show that the weight of an adult is increasing the incidence of food poisoning.
Many people's bees, such as breastnuts, are very soft, and the bees grow usually in such an environment.
According to Ivasa, food growth could be prevented by restoring the food environment around the stomach to respond to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of food treatments can be improved by focusing on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue.
The research results are published on 4 August in the estimated Nature Communications of Solubiology.
The point of family rape continues in court, the defendant is also required to commit a murder to another author
The point of family examination of the deceased continues in court for both cases.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for family surgery with Muhoks.
The other received 8 years of 4 months, including a young person, from murder and a broken robbery.
The other court is a 12-year-old prisoner of murder and armed robbery committed as a young person.
The court also ruled on the threat of traffic safety as a young person and on the right to transport the passenger seat as a young person.
Of the Court of Justice, the prosecutors, the experts and the judge were elected.
The defendant requires more punishment from a young man to be sentenced to 12 years in prison.
They were fully aware of the facts
According to law, 17-year-olds died as a head of the school's Child Protection Unit in July last year.
At the age of 17, he was attacked by a judge who was sitting in the living room at the back of the hall.
The leader had gone to get out of the room and buried a young man in his room, while another young man found him in an orphanage.
The leader was also beaten, beaten, and beaten.
According to the survey, both judgments were in fact fully understood.
According to the law, young people had planned to leave their families from at least the previous day.

Donald Trump Economics - People's News
The American Donald Trump doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third country would be deprived of all tax revenues if Donald Trump’s turnover to corporate tax was carried out.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular through the most profitable tax incentives.
Trump described his tax programme as a state-of-the-art presentation in Detroit on Monday.
The company tax fell by 35 per cent to 15 per cent.
It would be a huge sum of $1,000 billion a year.
The excess income tax rate is now 39.6, following the fall of Trump.
I'd like to be fully released from the home tax.
Trump accused the State of over-regulating the life of the country and of extending small-scale competitions.
The environmental standards decided by emergency must be new and the energy sector regulation must be repealed.
Barack Obaman's health care department must be re-treated.
The administration must be designated "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, "dangerous" trade policy is the biggest cause of U.S. problems.
The free trade agreements would be said to be gone.
For imports from China 45 per cent and 35 per cent of Mexico would be taxed.
We're offering a new future.
Americanity, not globalism, is our religion, Trump's public.
Donald Trump, America, does not need to change the world:
American cars are coming along the streets, American planes are joining cities, American ships are taking control of the sea, American steel is bringing up new tankers all over the country.
On the other hand, Trump faithfully read through the assistants’ written speech, despite the fact that well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economists - including the Republicans in the vicinity - will see the United States bring the Trump programme into serious economic decline.
Hillary Clinton published his own program in the spring of the day in Finland.
Attack on the past - People's News
The sea is melting at once, but the main attack area lies in the middle of the Madrid Cave.
It's where the story of Pedro Almodóvar's new history has been confirmed.
Almodovor’s previous leadership work The Matkarakaskas (2013) was a small village and a coastal satirical comedy, ahead of Iho, where the Spanish-born Ur tops of life (2011).
Levelly Julieta (2016) is located between two of them.
It's a good bond between love, human relations and family, which is between the mother and the daughter.
The story is simple, and it's seen as a very long backbone.
Life is influenced by the model of the middle-aged man (Emma Suarez), but then everyone is at risk of being discouraged.
The new man (Dario Grandinnett) can always be surprised at the end of the film.
In the form of a short and long letter, Julie repeats the stages of her life to an adult girl.
He starts time before the birth of a daughter, the moment he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, the second female head of the family will grow up as a young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, from a TV-known series between Ommelte time (2013-2014).
The ageing of the party has been treated in a way that can be considered a kitchen, but I would say myself that time is difficult and meaningful in the case of repeated periods.
Almodóvar films are often so well known for the always-recognition of boredom, and also in Juliet there is a fair distance.
It is displayed with balance, delayed, a place where good music contains a place and especially a popular movie where it is the only thing that has an elegance.
Instead, the Spanish leader has a typical visual colour density and so that it begins to take a bit of a quiet look more pure in shape than acting as a dramatic act.
People in the film are suffering from diseases, deaths or other immediate losses, but the surface remains the same as Korea.
This is particularly true of dressing: in the case of names, people change from face to face, and the same is true of appearance corps.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main points of the meeting are not more immediate than this.
Mechanically, the effect is external and low-spirited.
Almodóvar has made a written statement on the basis of three new Canadian novels named Alice Munron in Noble 2013.
The novels are published in the book Carculin: Stories.
Almodóvar has contributed to the dialogue, resulting in a low level of written literacy.
The only things would have been emotionally far more powerful than the drama, its big things - especially serious guilt - are dealing with the theme of the leff.
Instructions and signature: Pedro Almodóvar.
It's based on Alice Munron's three novels.
Main characters: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinnett.
It's 12.8 from the front of the movie.
The government is trying to make a choice - People News
New cuts will not be made, the ministers are going to make sure that the fundamentals are not really falling apart.
However, the cuts made in the winter are made by the stock trade.
There's no new tapes coming.
There's already enough savings of four billion.
This is how Prime Minister Juha Sipil (center) and Minister for Finance Peter Orpo (total) are assured.
It should bear in mind that the VM's presentation does not contain new cuts because social security cuts have already been decided in the early summer.
Children's, national pensions, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits related to national pension indexes are less than 0.85 per cent.
The period of compulsory unemployment insurance shall be reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
The training sessions are continuing.
Aeronautics
Why are ministers so excited about not making new cuts on them?
Because the first year is the election year.
The birds are kept in April and are the most important heat meter in the range, they are not gallblades.
It has already been seen that the representative income of the various government parties will be spent in the long term of the government's sense of responsibility.
However, the Gallups claim that the government party's basic interests are expected to fall into a state-of-the-art state, although the result of its previous elections was 12.3 per cent in comparison with the representative.
Four years ago, the basics were given a new mandate of 752 which, for most of them, was first realized early in the administration of justice.
The life span of the three major governments for the same purpose is to ensure that the basic wage of the Finnish people is maintained.
Now it has not endured, but more than half of the votes have been sufficient for government policy in the first year already.
The first signs of the use of the Group of Representatives of the Party have also come to the surface.
The fact that new cuts are not first reflected in the rhetoric is that they are made in the first year and, second, they are trying to slow down the expectations of fundamentalists.
Great events in 2018?
After a year, everything is probably different... if the Sipil government is still in its power.
The government has set the target of borrowing in this election, but Peter Orpon's budget budget will take EUR 5.9 billion for the first year, more than this year.
After the election, the government has two options.
The first is to raise the hands that can already be in the middle of the election and admit that the government cannot comply with its own programme: debt is not paid and not even delayed.
The other one's got to stick to the program.
This means new more severe cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would run at least close to balance in 2018 and then in the winter it will be taken against what will happen.
These activities do not cover debt
It is quite clear that at present, debt does not go away, even if the Lord Sip is trying to read a positive feeling.
The reports submitted by the Secretary of State, Mr Hetemäen, in the file format by Mr Hetemäen, shall be without prejudice to the following:
The growth of the world economy has repeatedly shown itself to be overprivileged, i.e. water aid from the international economy is not coming.
Finland’s national economy has not just risen since the collapse of 2008 except during the period of the life-threatening policy launched in the beginning of 2010.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent over the past decade and increased from 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now amounts to EUR 3 billion per year more than in 2008.
The debt of the public communities over 60 per cent in summer in 2014 will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the first decade.
What's responsible?
In February 2015, the claim submitted by the left-wing elite was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
In the first year, unemployment continued to pay about EUR six billion, which is actually covered by a new debt.
This is the discussion, meeting and fundamentals of what is responsible.
Question: The King wants to leave a lot of tasks
Three out of four considers that the organization of day care, youth work and movement of children is a duty expressed in the study of the KAKS - Kingdom Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the nation will also be accountable to the individual king for books, culture, civil services, construction, literacy education and waste care.
As a result of the country's responsibility, it is more likely that agriculture, special care, vocational training, vocational training and more developmental care will be provided.
I do not want to transfer any of the tasks entrusted to the public to the State.
A temporary bike break for a back-to-back decision of the police force
A 16-year-old driver was driving from the police station at Joensussa Ilomantsin Road for half a week.
The police party tried to stop the engine engine without lights, but a young man went out to drive the police overboard.
The back time went on to the Sunkajan Range, which continued to the Sorronahontia and the smaller forest, where the motorcycling drove out of the road.
After this, the young man went to the river kark, but the faster the police took the cark.
The rest sheet for the driver was displayed at 0.75 prom.
He also had no car license that would have been allowed on a motorcycle.
The case shall be examined, inter alia, as a risk to traffic safety.
There's been a river in the rock.
The river was at the foot of Mount Polvijärt in the summer of August at 21.15 p.m.
The river was headed to the left side of the road in a narrow, narrow way out of the road and fell to the narrow gate.
The rescue facility received a detonated carrier from a collapsed train over the upper door with the rescue helicopter personnel and the first crew.
The car's building was the responsibility of the owner of the car.
From the roof of the roof of the building, the wall was filled with hydro oil, which the relief plant was immersing in the mud.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The old woman died last night in the air

Impartiality in the sky - see picture gallery of the destruction of Parafestin
The roofs of Parafest-festivals caused a number of damages.
The President of the Joensuu Parafesty Foundation, Arto Pippuri, assessed that the festival is going to reach its feet economically and that the event can also be arranged in the first year.
The last performance of Parafestin in Kalle Salonen was at the end of the spring evening as a dormitory.
On Thursday, the programme will continue at 13 a.m. in the city theater rooms.
The Art Centre in Ahjo is a Parafest exhibition from 13-15 am.
The programme is planned.
The pollutant is born in the open air when your seeds and its pressure trigger a low airflow.
The changes in the shape of the open water form are associated with heat, and thus the drop in air is slow and the earth is rapidly moving toward it.
Aircraft plant tells us that food poisoning occurs in Finland several times during the summer.
It's hard to predict the path of the search engine.
The search tour of Parafestin was held at the back of Joensuu in the morning before five o'clock.
Three rooms fell into a coma, and there were about 200 people in the rooms.
In case of an accident, you're gonna have to break up with four people.
In the course there was one child who was transported gently to continued treatment.

According to the study, Western skin is getting older at a lower rate.
That's why they're getting old. They're airborne.
The British research tells Evening Standard.
The British company Caci analysed London without the most sensitive minors and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many long-term Western skin is two and a half years older than even an adult living in a rural area.
The quality of the old-fashioned minivans is a very fine fuel supply, which is the source of the transport fuel.
The same cuts also cause respiratory problems, which, according to Evening Standard, die of nearly 9,500 per year.
Studies have found that small amounts of particles are needed to pass through the most important part of the body.
In the Cacin study, an early age was found to be a risk, especially for those who travel their job by walking around rough streets.
The residents of London may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example in different nams, but more practically, by recommending regular cleaning.
The tractor's tracks were wrong. You'd be in front of a man's sex.
The man was moving on a stone tractor in his backyard.
When she got out of the tractor and went ahead of it, the tractor's wheels went wrong and the tractor hit the man.
The man didn't leave it, but the tractor, however, took him from a heavy man because he was transported to the central bank as a heavy target for further research.
The tractor didn't cause more damage, because it broke in front of the rocks.

By Josban, Kataja and Jokikiki in the U.S.
Anne Jumppanen has played almost all of the sales band MM since 2003.
Today, Tampere has already had six rounds, only 2013 remained in the middle of Canada's better North American casinos.
I was working in the market and playing in the female market when I saw the report.
The U.S. was in the process of establishing a subgroup of sales companies.
I'm interested and I'm interested in it now, Jumppane, 48, says.
Jumppane was born in 1967 near New York City, Elizabeth.
The family changed when the daughter of Helsinki grew old.
In 1987, Jumppane was able to study data processing at the University of Joensuu.
When I came to Joensuuu, these guys aren't played at the SM level as well as Salibandy.
He was playing the game at the university.
I played the catacomb and later in the Joki Sons in the SM series, remember Jumppane.
Jumppane played the SM series in the follow-up of the university, from 1991 to 92, the following three through the course of Josbas.
At the end of the game, he was preparing to follow the A girls into the master's room.
The women's SM story was lifted up in 1995.
All of his Jumppane played through the SM 10 series of women, adding 169 to the score 51+34=85.
The latest SM show is 2001-2002.
Parttu Pusca and Tatu Väne were appointed to the rural group
Joensulouse's payout, Josban grew up in Pertu Pusca and the real estate of Tatu Vänne was chosen for the Finnish real estate group, which will play in the Czech Brno EFT market from 6 to 8 November.
In Helsinki, a 25-year-old attacker in Pertu Pusca has played this before six men's landings in which he has repeated his total operations 9+4=13.
At 32 years of age, a 32-year-old Swedish-Wiler-Erisgen, Tatu Vänen, a representative of Sweden, has made a difficult journey and is part of the rural population's insurance company's 117 farming experience.
The event was also called the Song of the Players' Concordance, Mika Kohonen, who was seen in Finland last time in the MM series of December.

Beach Volley - Teatour Essi Hasun surrounding Kouvola - SM-culta missing reward cap
The first Hasu is to end as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the end of the course.
Beach volleyballs in Finland will be solved by weekend at the Couvola Sports Expo.
For three days, metal is played on both adult and young rows.
In cooperation with Kouvola Airports and the Finnish Airport, six best pairs are awarded to each row ranking.
The local color in the tournament represents the growth of Elimäen NMKY by Essi Hasu, who has been part of the Finnish beach volleyball games for many years.
Hasu, who lives in Helsinki today, is waiting for exciting games in front of the public.
Hopefully as many as possible will arrive at the weekend view.
There's probably a good place for the Pess stadium.
I'm not very often played in the adult series, so it's great to play in fine homes, Hasu felt.
The cobblestone wall burned down the Hasun's cricket dance and gave the good eves to a great surprise.
As a child, you have good memories.
I started a 9-year-old airport in the E-mail of Elimäen NMKY.
Most importantly, there are too many games in the mind, in the noses, spins of dust, and soft briefs and choreographs after the score, Hasu remembers.
In a small village, there was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group’s associates created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were firmly engaged in the work - the father of the team teammate prepared us and our mother was a long-term vice president.
The first Hasule beach volley has already been a natural variety of nature as a counterweight in the interior.
It's been played since the 1990s by the U.S. Navy.
The operation has always been active.
I also went on my own to follow up on the part of the young SM tour, thinking that I would play there myself one day.
Now this attack will take place when Hasu plays on the weekend together with a long-distance Anna Parkis in the SM finals.
In the second round of the tournament of the State of Latvia and Taru Lahden, the two goals of the second race are clear.
As a real goal, we have a measure.
We still lack SM gold, Hasu throws valuablely.
The appearance of the weekend in Kowulola may be the last known public meeting for Hasul.
At the beginning of September, new challenges are expected in the civil service.
Yes, the end of the international storm is after Kiskalelli's turn.
On the other hand, security is being set up at least temporarily, Hasu is planning.
The search center dropped buildings in the event of the hurricanes in Joensusus, the magnitude was close
The search tour ended in three rooms at the famous Parafest Festival in Joensusu.
According to the newspaper Karjalais, four people were injured in an accident.
One child was transported to the hospital for further treatment.
It is estimated that there were about 200 people in the rooms.
There was a show in one large room.
Two rooms were smaller.
An accident occurred on Friday at 7:00 p.m.
The daily fireman, Mr. Markus Vitaniemi, tells the paper that in this case there were the causes of immeasurableness.
Well, I'm sure it's still going to be a trial.

Solomon Koli courageously went as a farmer
Agriculture as a company means risks, flexibility and flexibility.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25 became a farmer because he believed in a positive future in the land as well.
Koli started two years ago, together with his little brother Valttari Koli, who continued his activities as a member of their home.
Their father, Marcus Koli, helps and advises the brothers through their own experience.
Starting as an entrepreneur meant increasing debt and status so that the company could get out of agriculture.
This has been from a little boy until it happened to me.
I've always liked the world, and now that I've started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything into play.
If something starts, I think it should be done in the right way.
In 2013, we went to build a platoon pool, and at first the bank had not been inspired by it.
However, I myself went to the project with great courage, and I have been there full of it, Solomon Kol tells me and adds that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the pure food produced by Finnish and that everything would still be fine.
The goal of Solomon Koli’s growing meat cars is to invest even more heavily in his nest.
The work has produced results because Solomon Kol has been selected to the ten best groups in the future of the Earth in the competition of the young food producer.
At best, he competes for a possible victory.
He'll be able to vote on the page by 21.8.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria's monthly inflation was 1 % in July.
This is the highest value for many years (after June 2012) and for the first time when it rises above zero after the last year, when the country reported 0.2 per cent positive inflation.
The annual average inflation measured by CPI over the last 12 months (October 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (October 2014 to July 2015) was –0.8 %.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0 % compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
Since the beginning of the year (in June 2016 the percentage compared to December 2015) has been –0.2 %, and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to –0.2 % by 2015.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, the prices of the following consumer groups increased: food and non-alcoholic drinks (1.7%), walking hours (1.8%), work and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices are low in clothing and feet (2.2%), in expenditure, household appliances and time zones (0.5%) and in health (0.1%).
The prices of the following product groups remained at the same level as the previous month: alcohol and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and training.
Snapchat’s anime activity is criticised as an Asian caricatyre
Snapchat says that as an inducement to this recommendation, it is an engine, but some observers think it's racist.
With the help of the Snapchat Lens Tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play in ways that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a mother, a dog or a bitch in the Roy Liechtenstein landscape.
Lins are beautiful, limited-deterred tools that create more than 30 million more powerful self-esteems on a day.
All the sharks will soon come to the public.
Snapchatin lenses have been part of a review of which it has been accused of recommending blackface usi or white skin drops.
So when it offered some of its users this week a suggestion that changed their eyes into wine, misdiagnosed teeth and made postage stamps, some of them called it a racist cartoon from Asian people ("yellowface").
They also wondered whether these repeated arguments referred to the greater problem with which the company had a difference.
The news and noise spread to the center of the week, and it was written, among other things, online publications The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat told his address.
The company gave the following explanation: the license was meant to be an expression of respect for anime disease, not for Asian people's caricature.
But to observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of skeletal stereotypes.
Some of them strongly accused our mother of having an abortion.
Korean American art scholar Grace Sparapan, who was widely distributed on Twitter, said in his e-mail that the lens was "at least boring and embarrassing".
He adds: "I find it difficult to resist the impact of a very rich Asian industry on the efficiency of the industry.
It shows that I didn't recommend that it be not just "yellowface," but that it is the result of such a worsening excellence."
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural duties.
In American culture, I have always had an endless campaign on diversity and social participation from the governments of companies to Hollywood and the equipment that we carry with us.
The large audience of Snapchat consists of young people who are from ethnic backgrounds more than their parents are. This may mean that they are probably expecting even more sympathy.
"When one of the Snapchat's lens creates a picture that strikes the user, these kinds of things are no longer very easy to see, as before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu as a torrent.
Zhu, a producer and planner working on the Media Press Service, decided to remove his Snapchat account as a torrent and encouraged others to do the same.
In the media's written and telephony, he said he believed that racism-related disputes revealed a lack of diversity in the use of Snapchat.
Zhu criticised most of the company as a white and only male leader and decided to write on his hat: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that in their individual personality there are no colourful people in which they can make such decisions, or then they also have workers in color, but their position is not so that they would trust to tell their opinions directly and easily," says Chinese American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has left much to answer the claim.
The entity shall not publish a list of the ethnic background of its staff as a private company.
In Torstana Snapchat, he refused to discuss the ethnic background of his staff, but according to the informant, the company has recently hired a recruiter whose aim is to focus on the groups of people involved and the promotion of participation within the company.
In part, Zhu says that he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need to increase our users like us to say that this isn't OK."
According to the Congress expert group, military officers misappropriated information about Isis
The Congress expert group would publish a report to Torstana which said that the officials of the United States Army, Central Command, had changed the intelligence reports so that they would give Isis a more optimistic picture than what happened in the field of understanding the subject.
The Presidents of the Sub-Committee on the Information and Defence Committee (House Armed Services Committee) established a working group, which, in its inter-reporting report, refers to the "inconsistencies" of the media.
Central Command, short Centcom, is the head of the United States military forces located in Tampa, Florida, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The findings adopted by the senior leaders of the Centcom gave the United States a more positive picture of its counter-terrorism activities than the facts in the field have shown and were more positive than in the analysis of other units of the Information Community," says the press release on the report.
"Centcom events cannot be accepted – our military is suffering when false analyses are presented to high-level political decision makers," says President Ken Calvert of the Republic of California.
"Centcom's lead report extends errors to the top level of the organization."
The extensive 10-page report details of the ongoing problems identified in 2014 and 2015, which are described and analysed by the Central Command for the training of Iraqi groups.
While the report does not contain conclusive evidence that the reports by the authorities of Obaman would have been incorrect, it provides an analytical picture of the fact that the Centcom leaders would have been compelled to present them with a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Isis.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command's press releases, opinions and conferences were significantly more positive than they were in fact," says the report.
"For example, the Centcom official has publicly given an opinion on whether a major military coup could take place in April or May 2015 to remand Mosul."
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of Isis.
"This is very clear after months of research," said President of the Republic of Kansas, Mike Pompeo.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015 at the highest level of United States troops, the IT leaders maneuvered the results of the investigation to reduce the threat of Isis in Iraq."
The Republicans based the working group on knowledge of the submission of analytical doubts that the information on Isis would have been manipulated.
The report will be published in Torstena as further results are being published, as studies continue to.
In addition, the Ombudsman of the Ministry of Defence has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
The members of the Committee which is responsible for informing the House of Representatives would publish their own results, which were partly consistent with the conclusions of the Group of Republicarians.
"Centcom created a very limited process between 2014 and 2015, which evaluated information on Isis and Iraq's security groups," says the Committee's High Commissioner, Adam B. Schiff.
According to Schiff, this process "has slowed down the publication of research results, 'lost the morality of analytical methods' and 'takes due account of a wide range of views'.
According to Schiff and Democrats, however, there was no evidence that the White House would have tried to highlight the analyses of Centcom to adapt its decision "to a pre-ordained or political official line".
The newspaper Daily Beast reported on the results of the congress's study.
In late August, the New York Times reported on the study of the reviewer of Pentagon, who was initiated as a result of the allegations made by Centcom's analysts.
The rapporteur, Lieutenant General Patrick Evans, says that the Ministry of Defence does not comment on the report of the Congress as long as the study of the inspector is under way.
However, he says, "Scientists sometimes have different opinions about the interpretation of information in a variety of ways, and the Community and the Ministry of Science and Defence consider it a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation has other consequences in addition to trying to find out whether the United States-led bombings have been successful in Iraq and Syria (i.e. the claim made by the defence authorities more frequently).
However, the allegations made last year may have been a matter of how much President Obama can trust the Central Command and how it provides real assessments of the military operations of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of parental research reflects the differences that arose over ten years ago when Centcom's research analyst Gregory Hooker published a study by President George W. Bushin, despite the responses of many analysts, supported only a small group in Iraq and used only a little time to figure out what would be the result of the 2003 earthquake.
Hooker also had a central role in Isis' research in the cape.
According to the authorities last year, the Hooker Working Group decided that despite its conflicting public opinions, the air air to Isis' governments had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary shares and could thus sell oil on the black markets.
However, the results of the study were not included outside the Central Command, reports The Times in September.
In the last year, Centcom’s comment, General Lloyd J. Austin III, had to be critical of the fact that many legislators had assessed the evidence statements given to the Senate to be too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April, and his position as Commander of Central Command was raised by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States will win the fourth second round of women's payroll and confirm its position with Britain
It takes three lands in the winning box, on the ground 6-1 in the game against Japan, Katie Bam made the U.S. women's first two land rounds of tortoise, when the United States won India.
Five paintings in two games could be considered a great achievement, but at the age of 27, Bam was not sure if he had previously succeeded in the same way.
"I don't have any idea," she says.
"I don't belong to people who want to count on their land."
However, he knows this: The Americans have won four games in the Olympics and have lost zero games and divided their first place with Britain, which continued to win their winnings by winning tortoise Japan chapters 2 to 0.
Britain and the United States play the opposite on Sunday in the last game of the first round.
Both groups have experienced finalization, which determines which of them is the first and which of the six groups is the first.
First of all, avoid spending more time with a group of Dutchmen who won the second reading.
Despite what it takes to play on Sunday, the Americans have already raised a total of amazing success in these cases, four years after its last 12 teams were in the Olympics in London.
Bam was also in London.
He grew up in Blue Bellis in the state of Pennsylvania and was the first to hit his paykey when he was only 3 years old (his parents played two-year-olds in Drexel). He was 16-year-old and was so young.
In 2008, the Olympics remained among him when he did not survive the final playlist.
Then came the year 2012 in which he and his team had not seen any success.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed to be the cook, and things began to change.
"The change was cultural, spirit and physical," says Bam.
"Our employer in London wasn't as good as it is now.
We've made a complete regulation."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the painting at the first half of the hall by shooting a ball near the wall inside.
India had come to play without any tournaments, but it proved to be an amazing opponent and kept the situation from 1 to 0 until the third period when Bam arrived in the field.
Bam carried the ball along a long side of the field left, pushed it to the center, found the ball on the ground and took the Americans to 2–0.
Melissa Gonzalez made the last floor in the middle of the fourth class.
The game was the first turn of the game, where the U.S. painter Jackie Briggs managed to keep the ground empty. In the first three games the American ground had won each piece.
Briggs lives now with his success.
Just like Bam.
"Our investment is good now," says Parnham, but how good it is, it depends on the outcome of the game on Sunday.
In the centre of the Olympics, trampoline is the same
No matter where or how much time it takes for the Olympics, no matter what.
Rio de Janeiro's events, competitions and competitions become the next urgent message on a continuous and universal basis.
The age as an Olympic itself would be a moving visual field that is transferred from the frequency range to the U.S., from the U.S. power plant to the power plant and from the power plant to the triathlonist.
You can't open a TV, read a dictionary or listen to your neighbor's conversation on the coffee line without listening to Simone Billes, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The Olympics' first-class Dooley noise was humorous and could well be the name of everyone who would see and hear the best time to watch and listen, would be the pleasure of sponsors and would be a good idea in TV movies if he was just a vampire, a power worker or even a rocker.
But Dooley, who lives at home in the California Lake Forest, 28, competes with the Olympics on trampoline.
The Olympic does not reflect all competitions equally.
Longer in the center, partly hidden are less known athletes, such as airstairs, speeds, lockers, and ceilings.
We're always gonna have a ride, and we're gonna have a long stay.
But if I am allowed to write about my own speciality, I would like to draw attention to the delay in trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic since the year 2000, its visibility over the past 16 years has been so small that many people who have challenged me have not known that it is still an Olympic.
Impartiality may be regional.
The United States has participated in the Olympic Games, but the country has never reached the medals and has not won the finals before 2012.
Men's medals in trampoline are known to go to Chinese and Russian, and women's medals are lost to Canadians.
The Chinese Dong Dong and the Canadian Rosie MacLenna are defending the gold medals they won in London this year.
However, Trampoline has the power to influence the weather, especially since it is more suitable for non-violence than for the Olympics.
(I recognise in this connection that I am not an expert, just a normal fan.)
The body has a combination of its potential, which has been used in the cross-sectional picture in continuous shock situations. However, it also has the same value as in force and urine pill, that is to say, in types that combine vitally in trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampoline, which means "the redhead".
The magnificent masters are excited by the large trampoline that connects them to a height of about 10 metres. Before landing, the climbers must carry out a series of acrobattic movements, such as wheels, roofs and walls.
According to the official Olympic Programme, hypnosis is assessed on the basis of performance, difficulty and "timer".
In Russia, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the master of trampoline violence. Of these, 16 are men and 16 are women.
The direction of the Olympics in general is directly ahead.
For the purposes of this purpose, gold is to reach the longer, faster, higher and more, sometimes more than the surface of the painting, while the opposite is in front of the surrounding field.
In addition to painting or leaving, they also have another objective that they are seeking in television reports, namely global or Olympic.
This specific goal is general, wonderful, even fantastic – and it's enough to get the viewer's attention.
But I also consider this to be a little new in the view of the cheeses.
This trampoline offers breathing.
In the trampoline, it's up.
The aim is not to move forward.
The power plant climbs up like an astronaut, falls down, and bends back and forth.
Of course, there is also a competitive aspect, and it is also not easy, but it is not linked to rapid rotation on the ground and not to long-distance, only to a dreamy and closed system of time and weight.
It's as close as the sound of an Olympic competition.
Women's carcinomas and finals are used on Friday evening and start at 13:00 a.m. local time and men's corresponding cheeses on Sunday at the same time.
NBC will send finals as part of its evening delivery which will start every day at 14:00 a.m. local time.
In the middle of the Olympics, they bring a peaceful and beautiful moment, which in the middle of the general riot may remain unknown.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering intelligent men and by presenting them – as U.S. men’s leaders recently proposed by Wall Street Journal – Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans.
The entire generation protested in Ethiopia, which is a long-term allies of the United States
Impartial Opinions in Ethiopia
The ruling groups have launched political changes in political opinion in various parts of Ethiopia.
Several fans have been shot dead in contact with the police, according to observers.
Is Ethiopia on its way?
For the last decade it has been one of Africa’s poorest countries and has been a reliable member of the Western Union, whose economy has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, the country has been dealing with anti-government attitudes that are still spreading to more and more regions.
I'm afraid that in the last week, thousands of people were going around the streets asking for a political change.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response was unwarranted.
According to viewers, the police shot and killed many unarmed fans.
It is unlikely that opinions at the end of the last year or in the videos described at the beginning of this year will show how security groups will strike young people who are forced to stand against the wall.
The UN-led human rights factor is now required for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and further exporting it is more difficult," says African Sarvi project researcher Rashid Abdi of the International Crisis Group.
On the left hand, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa after Nigeria, which has contributed to the stability of the West.
The U.S. Army and Information Service are actively supporting Ethiopian combating terrorism throughout the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few African countries, if anything, are getting so much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, and the capital of Addis Ababa is even a new era.
The city's ruins are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
Ethiopia, however, is still far from the country of democracy, and human rights organizations have continued to report on the fate policy of the government, the country's opposition is very restrictive, and the rest of the world is being shaken quickly.
Many people have been deported from the country, imprisoned, killed or banished to a country of their own.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are destroyed and there is no other option than to show their opinion, it will be thrown out," says Seyoum Teshome, a journalist working at the University of Central Ethiopia.
"All young people show their thoughts.
The whole generation protested."
There are many subjects of discontent about the use of land-based government coalitions in the fight against corruption.
The ruling party and its allies have been given a position previously belonged to the opposition following the elections that have been criticised over the past year, and as a result they now rule over Parliament as a whole.
At the same time, tensions are growing along the Eritrean border, where the deteriorating situation called for hundreds of deaths during the conflict in June.
Analysts fear that in recent years more or less sophisticated separatist groups, such as the release of Oromo or the liberation of Ogaden’s people, may attempt to exploit sectarianism and re-arm.
There are many reasons why the fragmented mind of the above years is being corrupted right now.
The first one is an obvious failure: smart phone calls.
In the last few years, Ethiopian people have been able to communicate in social media when public and Internet access has improved from the most successful smartphones.
However, when the government repeatedly prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during its comments, many access the Internet through intermediate services that hide their location.
Many Ethiopian youths told me that this was how they called people to their opinions.
The second reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest population groups in Ethiopia, the Russians and the amkharos.
The roses and amharas are not natural allies.
The amharas, mainly of Ethiopian Christianity, have long dominated the country’s political and commercial activities and fought wars, many of which are Muslim and living in sub - Saharan areas.
But it's also changing.
"Cooperation is under stress and we are under the same threshold," said Oromo-Director Mulatu Gemechu.
Most of the impressions have been made in the area of rose and amrah.
Many amrahs and Romans experience that Ethiopia is unjustly in control of the tiger home, which represents only about six percent of the population and, however, manages the army, the intelligence service, trade and politics.
The third reason behind these outbreaks is Meles Zenawin's death.
Former Prime Minister Meles was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unexplained disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical neuron who was able to see the bullet back.
According to analysts, he had to find the first signs of dissatisfaction and use the senders who agreed between the two sides.
"The government itself lacks this essential challenge," said conflict researcher Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemarim Desalegn, arrived near Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was home to North Ethiopia from the Tigris region, Haenameriam comes from the south.
According to analysts, he does not have the confidence of the security groups of the tiger management system.
Many fear that this means more bleeding.
The previous time in Ethiopia, there were similar conflicts in 2005, when thousands showed their opinion against voters who, according to analysts, were first defeated and then stolen.
In the post-election elections, many protestors were killed. The deaths were indeed less than in the previous month, and the spreads stopped relatively fast.
Development experts have highlighted Ethiopia's leaders with a long-term infrastructure plan such as new skills and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it has clearly not prevented its entry into force with regard to the internal beauty of Ethiopia’s administration.
And it's nice to take a dangerous ethnic form.
In the last month in the Amhara town of Gondara, fans attacked the owned companies of tigers, and the hate speech of tigers is in general in the social media.
According to analysts, protests by the U.S. and other western allies in the situation of tobacco.
The Government of the United States has used Ethiopia as a support point for unmanned, neighbouring Somalia to direct aircraft, but the aid point has recently been closed by the United States.
While the East wants to clearly support democracy, it also does not want its member in the area of doubt to be left alone.
"This requires strict balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he's a hero when he claims to be the founder of Obama Isis
In the evening, Donald J. Trump tried to bring his words back to his last campaign, arguing that he was not in fact claiming several times this week President Obama and Hillary Clinton's terrorist group "founders".
The clarification raised new issues for the Republican side of the President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers for a clear message to citizens of his country.
They also have to face a difficult situation with their supporters who must try to defend themselves for such a moment and explain comments that he may not have intended.
Trump filed a claim on Wednesday in the long term of election and repeated in several rounds of questions that he really meant what he said by arguing that the President and Hillary Clinton created Isis.
However, on Friday afternoon, Trump tweeted and claimed he was a coward.
Trump spent his entire speech on Twitter the previous day, when he said in many of his own accusations that he was really in the truth.
When radio conductor and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help bring the trumpet to a halt, it was claimed that Obama was trying to destroy Isis, the presidential candidate of the republic did not agree to withdraw his claim.
Finally, when Trump tried to focus his campaign back on economic support classes, he grew up.
Trump and Clinton kept their economic policy in Michigan this week.
In the evening, Trump tried to get back to the subject again.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and he thought Clinton's speech was old-fashioned.
Trump's been defended by a long time ago.
At the end of July he received a wide range of criticism when he urged Russians to hack into Hillary Clinton's e-mail. Later he explained his comments by saying, "Of course I was a spy."
In this way, Trump will reduce the limits of political speech and bring his words back if necessary.
"I believe it's his way of testing certain messages that awaken opposition in his supporters. He sees how supporters respond to messages, and then "definite" in a way or in other reactions," says media expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the use of both presidential language.
"But I also believe that he understands his claim and knows that they are enough circuits to cross different paths."
Instead of weakening his opinions on the election, Trump has changed his style even more in recent days when his support class has continued to count.
In the spring, a new NBC, Wall Street Journal and Maristin survey revealed that the support of Trump is significantly lower in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is very stable.
Just as Trump usually tries to avoid asking forgiveness for his provosive forest, he often blames his critics for their interpretation of his words or do not understand his humor.
However, since it has become increasingly clear that the President-in-Office's campaign in the last few months, the President-in-Office of the Council has taken his faithful supporters into a difficult position, where they have to publicly defend the comments of the House of Lords, regardless of how provosive they are.
One of the most important supporters of Trump, former President Rudolf W. Giulian of New York defended the presidential candidate in the CNN challenge.
"I consider him to be a political, political speaker," answered Giulian when asked about him, "Trump would be real, arguing that Obaman and Hillary Clinton founded Isis.
"It is true that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization called Obama completely wrong as "the lower line group" and so went, because he was driven out of Iraq."
Most representatives of the Republic are trying to claim that the government of Obaman, where Hillary Clinton was a foreign minister, allowed Isis to continue its activities when it did not deal with the situation definitively in the Middle East.
Before the election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his campaign against information tools on Twitter, where he accused them of taking his seat and having a different position against him.
He picked up "undefinable and exciting" television commentators who are trying to get out of him, but he says they can't make it.
Some democracies criticized Trump's explanation and simply said that he did not apply as president.
Due to the rise in undeterred rent, the oil stopped open in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a small small-scale coffee in Williamsburg, where the payment tool went only handy and did not have Wi-Fi, but which offered a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the coffee had to be priced outside at Bedford Avenue, when the rents were not met.
In the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie sells the form of cupcakes.
The locals consider this to be a cause for concern over the loss of the coffee due from centralisation.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB club no longer exists, Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed and Verb is now a fishing business."
But even if New York is no longer its former, there is also a new one.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new coffee point in Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb coffee has Wi-Fi and it can be paid on credit cards, but some employees are still the same and feel the same.
The coffee's still good.
The owner and head of the new Verb coffee is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old coffee.
He started in Verbis in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new coffee shop, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things in mind.
Verb installs luggage from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso-conomy model.
In addition, it took the use of even the old Verbin lamps again.
Rodriguez says, however, he wanted to try something new and
add new products to your list.
There are canal-candy-sandwiches and full-fledged and symmetrical cables.
There are also dark spots on the list.
The coffee can no longer be grown, but instead of small fruit juices.
For nine months now, Rodriguez says that he has noticed the beginning of the use of old customers in Verbis as an equivalent virtual unit.
"A lot of our old customers also had to be priced outside Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who went to the coffee shop late Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg before and regularly went to Verbis.
After his conversion to Greenpoint, he made his way back to the place in Williamsburg to Verbi.
When Verb's shut down, he'll tell him he's been out of coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verbin's coffee and culture," she says.
Now he drinks coffee again, although that Sunday he took his usual coffee instead of tea tea, which is also listed.
The second long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has faithfully visited Verbis since 2003.
He went to the coffee shop all the time before he got to work, and he just made the same move.
"I went down to the coffee shop every day for more than seven times as a machine, and there they already prepared my bottle with all the fillings," she says.
Picture: Rodriguez wanted to try something new and bring us new products.
Today, Rosenthal is still in the process of making his insurance product, but at this point he exchanges banana juice, butter and cheese.
Rodriguez says it's not nice to wear a shoe shop.
Soap Cherien's owners even offered to prepare a special cupboard used for the production of Verbin's own frozen coffee.
"We'll still be able to hold on to the offer," Rodriguez says.
Also, the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have taken a stand against the joy of coffee.
One of the new customers turned to food, and Rodriguez now tells her that she is looking for a suitable place for her new neighbors to feel welcome.
A new place has been introduced with other benefits.
The local company wants to bottle and sell frozen coffee.
The coffee can also extend to the next building.
However, for many customers it is enough that they get their old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph White was a vacuum cleaner in Williamsburg, and he tells his heart of his heart when the coffee was closed.
When a new place was opened and I placed some coffee there, it felt like I had arrived home, says White.
"I've been drinking coffee."
The great famine's hard food in the new factory: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in his office room in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as Cullinist, had liked the general food of the Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the gas station and the Maryland competition.
On that day his diet was more demanding: bad cannons (devilles egs) in tomatoes, groundnuts and as a follow-up zone.
"It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity for people who suffered," says Jane Ziegelman.
His husband, Andrew Coe, adds: "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The parish community in Brooklyn Heights serves as a food historian.
Coen's last book, named Chop Suey, tells of a Chinese kitchen in America, while Ziegelman's last book, 97 Orchard, tells Lower East Side through the history of a restaurant in the city.
Their new association is to spend Harper and publish A Square Meal, which portrays American food history as a great delight in the 1930s.
Paris showed its culinary solidarity when it agreed to meet with the supplier Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, which is a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron-Flatiron border, and was opened in the same year as a large press release took place in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, suffered from cancerous and oil-rich Sandwich and 57-year-old Coe for nausea, diarrhoea and diarrhoea.
When the supplier asked for meat, the parish said that it was appropriate to discuss the food of the very great famine.
"The disturbances were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People eat potatoes, bananas and papaya.
They were made of substances that were weak and sufficient.
Imagine that you ate so many peanuts that they're enough for the whole atrium."
Andrew Coe's coming.
"You've got to put pressure on your shoulder like a lily," she says.
Before the great years of famine, the American food table is especially active on the farm using the buffet principle "eat as much as you want".
Women provided food for agricultural workers, and restrictions were imposed on them for breakfast, lunch, and day-to-day.
The Americans had just sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. A Square Meal is one of the historical ways in which the nation was able to find out when the moment of emergency was to break up.
"This was the time when a central and worrying American speaker came from Sweden" says Coe and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
One concern was a new successful choice of food: according to Ziegelman, some of the important foods such as butter and potatoes came to the main treatment, and pasta was said to be "as a fun way to use food products", because the cooks may hide such attractive preparations in ceramics.
The small fruits were replaced by the worst dried fruits.
Of meat, which had been a major part of the American atterarium for years, the general public came to the rescue.
Strange combinations were tested, which were most important in the performance of calorie and dietary values, and were not so cheap or even healthy after lunch.
In his research for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared novels filled with earth’s food.
"It wasn't recommended at dinner," says Coe,
Ziegelma added: "It was unusual.
The earthquake and the news site don't fit at all.
This was a characteristic of many household recipes."
Domestic farmers, such as Louis Stanley, head of the Federal Ministry of Home Affairs, from 1923 to 1943, led citizens' food shortages in an unprecedented and unique way.
They would publish recipes and articles and encourage women to be budget holders and respond to the challenge of making paperboards such as a pork-kermaspaget.
A Square Meal is a historic feast.
The special challenges are the reactions of the Head of State to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover, "let me eat a piece of bread."
Just as he publicly passed on his childhood’s simple food in the olive field, he himself ate like a millionaire and a wonderful master who had come from him.
"He liked a manner-European kitchen like a fish and a chicken pan," says Coe.
"He ate near the table in the golden mains of the dining room, on top of his shirt.
He's been completely visited by the truth."
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had encouraged him to show an example.
As the book says, Mrs. Roosevelt's salary was paid by an economic operator who had not been interested in honey, food offered in the White House was more expensive than Washington, even the worst prepared."
A lot of lady food was abandoned as soon as the country got back to its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the tradition continues to show how we pay attention to fish and nutrition and how science has been applied to food.
The Paris office tells us that when she writes her first letter, she better understands Ziegelman’s mother’s eating disorders, such as why she could throw food away.
"He was really afraid that food would have to go away," said Coe.
"People have even begun to feel bad about her food," Ziegelman recalls.
"For example, once in a while."
When the main fish were emptied in Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe came home to prepare their own outdoor dishes, the same as President Roosevelt ate on lunch.
"It's called a change of heart," says Ziegelman, adding that giving the visible name to the unwanted recipes was a general blow.
There was no exchange of cereals, only fats, little beans, sugar, water and cane.
We wore our clothes in response to the pressure on our Russian memory.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe's true to you again and third time.
"Sex parties would do better than this," Coe says to her wife to hear from a positive budget holder.
Gilead Full Remuneration of Hepatitis C-Hepatitis with Mercki
The U.S. Regional Court of Justice ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to receive full compensation for the costs incurred by the C-Hepatitis C patented doctor with Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from fines of 200 million dollars, which had been imposed on it by two Merck's own patents related to the successful drugs of Gilead Sovaldi and Harvoni. The U.S. judge noted the violations of Merck, which included misdemeanour and other unfair practices.
According to Justice Beth Labson Freeman of the U.S. Regional Court of Justice in Torstena, Gilead had been entitled to exemption from court-martial contracts resulting from the defence of the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which manages markets in new generation C hepatitis drugs, which can treat more than 90% of hepatitis C patients.
The event takes place in 2013, when both Gilead and Merck challenged their second right and demanded the right to privacy of sofosbuvir under the laboratory. Sofosbuvir is an active substance in Gale.
United States support groups have ruled from the city of Manbì in Izsil
In the United States, supported groups have been held in North Syria near the city of Manjib, which is bordering Turkey, when the last end of the Isis Warsmen were removed from the city, the team informs the informant.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group is now struggling to find the last Isis fighters hidden in the city.
The representative of the Manbij Military Council of the SDF, Sharfan Darwish told Reuters that 2,000 hostages of the Isis fighters were released.
"The cave is now in our hands, but we are still carrying out search operations," Darwish said.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax
The president of the Democrats Hillary Clinton published his 2015 tax report, which shows that the income of her and her husband at that time was $10.75 million and their actual federal tax rate was 34.2.
In 2015 the Clintons contributed millions of dollars to charity organizations, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. The former President Bill Clinton served nearly $5.3 million as a phone call, and the former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton announced that he earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster's cost-effective letter dealing with his office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Vice-President of Clinton, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and his wife, Anne Holton, published 10-year tax statements.
In 2015, the actual tax percentage of the federal state in which they paid was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine still look like a model for economic transparency," says Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmier.
In full contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind the facts and withdrawing his promises of public tax.
As I say, the Presidents of the United States have always published their tax exemptions, although the law does not require them.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyer have led the tax administration to check and say why Trump has not published its income data.
"It's your move" tweeted by Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams in reference to the tax data proposed by the Democratic Party.
In Torstaina, Special Justice of Trump, Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not let Trump publish his tax statements before the checks were completed.
The President of the Republic, including Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican, said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump's own capital, his assistance to welfare, business relations and many other links, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has been involved in this issue and will publish a video on Friday, where he will present the Republicans who are in a visible position, who are suffering from Trump to publish their tax statements.
Torstena Clinton discussed the matter in her speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, and not to publish his tax notices," said Clinton.
According to the policy network, Trump has not paid taxes by law or paid only a few in the 1990s, and New York Times business colleges have been sitting around several tax auditors and auditors as they can still be the same.
The federal tax rates have risen as the central issue of presidential elections.
Clinton has supported the rule by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that more than a million dollars per year would pay at least 30 per cent of the tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week in Omaha, Nebraska, at the Buffett election in Clinton, which is located at the headquarters of the Berkshire Hataway Monastery in the same place, he challenged Trump's meeting where both of them would reveal their tax liability.
Buffet says he has also had to check the tax administration and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authorities but the voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax notices by year 2007.
Clintons, who are currently living in Chappaqua in the state of New York, paid the actual federal tax on an average of 32 per cent in 2007-2014 and their actual aggregate tax rate was about 40.5 per cent.
The 2015 Clinton tax report shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 was paid for their earnings.
Their main investment was the low-cost indexing fund, and Clintons reported the amount of share and surplus products of $109,000.

In support of the protection of young people in the Chilean language
The conservationists in Tanzania have sought an extraordinary way to keep the norms away from the human body – the young are threatened by the spread of condoms in the Chilean language.
Keino has proved to be effective, and a few years ago, the Honeyguide Foundation has launched a campaign together with the United States Nature Conservancy organization aimed at teaching the volunteers in northern Tanzania how residents can protect their homes and their crops without harming their young.
Some time later, the emergency treatment of young people was used.
The spring is the world's birthday dedicated to the protection of animals.
"The method we have developed has seen changes in the positions in these holes, because now the Westerns can trust that they can keep their noses out of their pockets without harming them," says the Executive Director of the Honeyguide Foundation, Damian Bell.
First, the squeezing noise is prevented by showing a bag of bags and by calling the tower.
If this doesn't work, let's start a chilipill.
In the case of multi-shelled cylinders, the condoms are fitted together with an electronic device, and then the condom head is turned around in such a way that only the fireplace remains outside.
When the fireplace is set on fire, the condom opens up and spreads out a fine Chilean shell.
Usually, one haircut is enough to take off your nose.
The last way is by means of an escape which shoots as a Roman hostage with a sense of joy and results in a severe and church explosion.
The Jewish film director criticised the Berlin hotels for the removal of Israel's target number from the Arab "calling" – RT News
A French-Journey Jewish film director was born after the media show revealed that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel did not mention Israel’s target number in the country list. The hotel staff invited Arab customers to come to "call".
Claude Lanzmann, the author of Shoah's Holocaust document, was shocked by the destruction of the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel by writing an open letter to Frankfurter Generale Zeitung (FAZ).
On his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find a hotel list for Israel.
However, it is not mentioned in a group of countries where rooms can be called directly.
"How is it possible for Israel to be completely destroyed in Berlin in 2016 in the new German capital – as if it had not been there?"
Lanzmann's writing.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through a separate telephone.
The film director asked for an explanation about the hotel's opposition.
Lanzmann writes a reply from the receptionist, which upsets him.
The respondent said that the removal of Israel from the list was "the decision to be taken by the Kempinski Hotel's management."
The reason behind the action was the film director still in progress.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: "Most of our visitors are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's target number."
Suddeutsche Zeiting, challenging Israel's German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, said the case was "very embarrassing".
"It's a trap to shock and insult us all.
It's a big shame.
And it's more embarrassing when we take into account that we're in Germany and there's this hotel visitor.
It doesn't need any more explanations.
We are waiting for the hotel to make the right decisions," says the paper.
The incident caused quite a response on the network where it was called scandal.
Part of the complaint was simply submitted to the claims by the Arab customers at the Kempinski Hotel.
"Dear" was said in a publication where a hotel location was shown near the church on the Kurfurstendam street.
Der Spiegel writes the charges against the hotel quickly, calls the event a mistake and asks for forgiveness from Lanzmann.
"The direct order to leave Israel has never been issued from the guidance list," writes Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski, representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the reference number has subsequently been added to the list.
Police used greenhouse gas and mercury in the opinion of Brazilian students
The students joined the police in São Paulo as they gathered together to express their opinion on the reform of the government’s public education system.
The police used explosives and explosives against fans.
The riot began when the law enforcement authorities tried to set up a school team, which resulted in the use of ammunition and gas.
The survey included hundreds of students who wanted to show their enthusiasm for government plans.
Mr. Geraldo Alckmin, Governor of State of the State of São Paulo, has made a proposal for a savings measure involving close to one hundred public schools and 300 000 students are admitted to new schools.
Some of the speakers made graffiti to the walls where the president's office was temporarily opposed by Michel Temer.
The students' opinion took place only a few days after the missing president, Dilma Rousseffa, who supported the sponsors of the country, voted in a Senate vote on this issue.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased 71% – RT Business
The annual trade change between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9% after the removal of packages, says Russian Iranian Ambassador Levan Dzhagaryan.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in business in Iran has increased since international charges against Iran were dropped.
"The Russian companies will continue to have existing relations with Iran, while the new companies are ready to enter the market.
The growth of trade remains, of course, one of the main objectives of cooperation between countries," Dzhagaryan says.
He notes that during the first five months of 2016, trade exchange between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent over the same period in 2015 and increased by 856 million dollars.
"In particular, Russia's exports to Iran rose by 91.5 per cent, by 697 million dollars.
Russia's imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
Trade accelerated the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says the paper.
Dzhagaryan also expects that the expected number of Iranian tourists will travel to Russia this year.
"In recent years, Russia's Foreign Office in Iran has granted its citizens some 35,000 visas, most of which were travel routes.
In addition, Iran had its first tourist destination in the first 20 countries to travel to Russia.
And it's not too religious to say that the expected number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia is falling this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the great envoy hopes to change.
"I was able to personally recommend travel to the cities of Isfahan, Shirazin and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of old Persian civilization in good health," he says.
Skotti Callum Skinner would have hit the ground when the British won the gold round.
Scotland's Callum Skinner was awarded to the famous team of men at the Rion vetodrome last night when the third British champion of London was awarded a Mastership in 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow Skinner was in a role that he played by his Scottish-born Sir Chris Hoylta. The young man made the legend very high by thanking the ground and approaching the winner as a pre-conceived member of the New Zealand team.
Britain received a surprise four years ago when Hoy won a fifth of his sixth Olympics.
And they came back after only six March to the MMs held in London, despite the fact that Hoy had later left his competition career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staffin, the first passenger.
The price came right on time.
Also, Hoy's decision to decide on the competition left the opening that Kian Emmadi and Matt Crampton were trying to achieve.
Scotlandn Skinner was a man in whom British manufacturers believed and where they saw the potential he now had.
Hindes, with Hoy, four years ago, won the mastership of Kenny and Skinner during the time of the Olympics, but the first round of New Zealand was faster.
And the third British won the gold medal.
The price was right after his turn, but Kenny tried to take the lead in the team that Skinner kept.
The most important part of the change was to change the strategy so that the Hindus went to slow down in a larger shift, which led to Kenny and especially Skinner being able to keep pace.
Hoy followed up on the BBC's comments and aimed at seeing Skinner, Kenny and Hindes looking at their payroll.
The 23-year-old Glasgowne Skinner says: "I'm tired of breastfeeding.
I was just trying to do my best and succeed.
We did the Olympics in the finals, and we won the world championships.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win it."
After winning in London in 2012 Hindes agreed with Kenny and Hoy to join the ranks of the row for bad departure.
Later he began his talk, and Britain's competition partners did not have a vote machine.
This time there were no problems with the sovereigns.
The Hindu says: "The tunnel was like London, all the British tribes were laughing at the scene.
Our group was formed into a unit during the last three months.
We've lost so much of the world's heritage that the victory in the Olympics feels great."
In other words, I'm saying one competition, one gold country that won Seventeen bicycle races, both in Beijing and in London.
If this is a meter for progress over the last five months, there are five days of success in the field.
As Kenny's ability has shown, it is not impossible to imagine that she will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympics in one Olympic.
This would mean drawing the record from six gold medals and one hopper to Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger and also born on March 23rd (as the present date of the British Games, which is also the birth date of Steve Redgraven, Mo Farah and Roger Banister).
It would be the same as Hoyla.
Kenny competes next time in the spretch which starts today and resolves after three days.
A 28-year-old Boltonian, Kenny, says: "At this point, I can only be happy about this.
Group competition is always the best.
You can enjoy winning together with friends.
The only winning is a little alone."
The Hindus say, "If he wins two more cults, he has to get the value of the guitar."
This was one day's only medal competition, but Britain got more news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doul were the fastest four men in the team.
Their time was 3:51,943.
The world prize held in London in 2012 and won gold is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final (from 22.42 p.m.) will be competitive today as the second day of the competition, and the focus will certainly be on Wiggins.
He had to argue with the competitors yesterday before the time when the suppliers invited him to measure his length.
In the corresponding competition for women that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milgawai, Katie Archibald, who are at home in the world, reached 4:13.260.
The Iso-British team can now trust that its powerful wheel crew will take responsibility for the average Olympics and bring a group of measurements to the country.
The complete leadership position in Beijing and London after the truly exceptional performances before Rio has been underestimated.
There have been dramas, of which there have been at least no technical leader Shane Sutton's release in April between the allegations of sexism and temptation, and the finalisation of large players, such as Hoyn and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held by the jury on the first night show that the legitimate reputation of East Britain is already going up to the summit once again at a full time.
The future of Portland’s flagship by challenging the conclusion of an electronic contract
The future of the Aluminum Treaty in Portland, in the State of Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers are at risk when the power plant to supply electricity to the port of Victoria said that one of the owners is in a fragile supply agreement and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria to continue its support to be maintained.
The 20-year-old support will stop in November.
Alcoan Portland is at risk of losing almost 2,000 jobs.
As a result of interruptions, even 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The impact of lightning can continue to increase, as it is estimated that about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity production is consumed.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's office, which resulted in the last year's closure of the English authorities.
Alcoan Portland's salon is losing money and is in danger of closing his door.
The measures are in line with the future of speculators that have been used for years, which initially caused Australia's strong dollar and which are later the price of production.
AGL, which provides a large aluminium sink with electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant located in Latrobe Valley, says it is expected that three other lighthouse owners will also be required to terminate their contract.
As a majority employer, Alcoan and Alumina are a company formed. The Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Maruben Corp own minority shares.
AGL says that it is expected that the production industry will continue to operate in Portland, which means that physical electricity demand will continue to decline.
The AGL shall inform the parties that, for example, the security agreements were to enter into force in November 2016.
The expiry date refers to the 12-month period of validity of the contracts, which shall expire in 2017.
"The AGL therefore expects revenue from contracts to be produced in the financial year 2017," says the Authority.
The potential effects of production on AGL from 2018 onwards will now limit the strong market views of the future in terms of electricity market support prices.
AGL already says the value of its discounted contracts in the book at $187 million "in recent years for the award of contracts".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts "does not affect Alcoa ... should not affect the preparations in the operation or secure the operation without the use of electricity".
The American company reported on its 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was intended to enter into force since November 2010, although it still needs to be explained why it has now withdrawn from the contract.
As a result of the low economic situation in the area, analysts have been careful about their evaluations, the entry into service in the State of Victoria in Portland and the construction of Togo in the vicinity of Newcastle.
AGL's operational director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts last week that in the year Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and about 900 megawatts of Tomago.
"If these measures are removed from the market, it means a significant demand for (e-mail) on the market.
As a producer, it wouldn't be good news," says Mikkelsen.
Cardassian real-time television station Kendall in September for the non-cancer of Vogue
The Kardashian-Jenner-Klanian model and her mother and manager of Kristin's four daughter Kendall Jenner, 20, is listed in the number of U.S. Vogues in September.
Kendall, who is the famous architect of Estee Lauder and has been present in Milan, Paris and New York, announced a new Instagram tours.
"As I looked at the room that was full of my favorite, I got into the kitchen," Kendall wrote.
The release of the cancer resulted in its own (or perhaps only the style of the Kardashian series?), a video that showed all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (barbar disorder Rob and Caitlyn and all the like, the Kardashian program producer Ryan Seacrest). The video concludes with a classic translation: they were all in the process of planning a national surprise.
June is critical, and it is used in almost all birthdays of asthenes (Seacrest says: "Do you think we've forgotten you?" as suddenly as children's television show tomorrow), but Kristin had to get other girls in some way according to this publication.
Because in the number of Vogues in September, it means to contradict the time of the new Kardashians.
Kendall's Isosososo Kim was able to pass on Vogue's position before (she appeared in Vogue's office together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the number of September is exactly her own class.
The number of September is the publication of Vogue's sales year.
The demand for a larger description than the number to be remembered on the form page attracts a large number of authors (the fashionability of Fashion estimates that in the last 832-page lesson, 615 pages were mentioned).
The publication of the September number of people is expected to be so rapid that during the two preceding years, the pictures of the paper have already been published before official notification.
Previously on September, they had been like Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years there have been more hearsays than models that are hearsays.
The Oscar winner and Dior prize winner Jennifer Lawrence was in prison in 2013, and the year later, Lady Gaga was awarded a prize.
It was easy to describe Jenner’s offspring as successful, and although he would later be included in a group of famous works, he is quite well followed.
These features are not known to people's relatives, real TV show or today's children who know how to do good Snapchat video (even Jenner is all of them).
They can rightly be described as generous women who succeed in the entertainment field over others.
In the last year of his career in Beyoncella, there is probably one of the strongest years of his career when he published his Lemonade album.
Of course, not all are happy about Jenner's success.
Because of his real-TV performance, Jenner's position in the transformation world will always be a support.
In June Victoria's Secretary's original model, Stephanie Seymour valued Jenner and his colleague Gig Hadidia by calling them "nant".
These feelings have disappeared on the surface again when the news about Jenner's appearance was published in Vogue.
However, the continued denial of contentment is unfair.
Kendall Jenner is the chancellor of the number of Vogue September.
He's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He's going to see Marc Jacobs' formations.
He's the most famous producer of Estee Lauder.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through taxable applications.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which he painted on LOVE's page.
And for free time, he's on real TV, maybe just a way to meet his sister and this kid.
Legal centres translate more than 160 000 people a year
Each year more than 160 000 people in the most vulnerable countries will be turned away from legal centres, and sectors will be prepared for the effects that additional funds will have on centres already operating at the frontiers.
In the state of Queensland, there are five persons already seeking free legal and professional services – most of them are persons, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unreasonably ill-founded decisions and similar injustices against people who fight without resources.
Public legal services whose workers are already overloaded are preparing for additional appropriations.
Since June of the first year, legal centres are at risk of losing 30% more of the funding of the EU.
The head of the Queensland Public Legal Centre, James Farrell, says that according to the most recent computerized report by the National Law Centres, thousands of people are removed from the centres each year.
If the federal administration does not reverse its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
"The public justice centres in Queensland are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away from the services they need in their search," Farrell says.
"People who are out of touch with illegal relations, people who are under uncontrollable and abusive debt, families who are separated from their families, workers who are unreasonably excluded – all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government intends to cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means that thousands of people in the poorest part of Queensland have to cope with multiple legal problems without assistance.
We invite the Legal Chancellor and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to grant these funds immediately so that people can get what they need.
In the last year, the government has fulfilled its promise to grant funding at the national central level.
It is now time to take into account the needs of public legal centres and their clients, and the Palaštuk Government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's campaign against the threat of a worker
New York: Donald Trump was attacked when no action was likely to take place after it was announced that the leader of the North Carolina campaign had threatened the worker with a weapon at their time in February in Jeep.
The event is described in a case where the former programme trainer, Vincent Bordeaux, of the State campaign, received an average week in Charlotte, the State Court of Justice.
Bordí says in the waiting months that the situation would be dealt with inside the campaign before he realized in his own words that this would not happen.
Bordeaux says that campaign leader Earl Phillip "presented a gun, put his right forward on top of it, and pressed the trigger on Vincent's gun".
According to the report, because of the campaign on local and regional grounds, Bordeaux heard that at least four other people had experienced the same experience with Phillip.
"Even though the gun wouldn't work out, it would cause harm," says Bordeaux in his statement.
Only two days after the presidential election of the Republicans caused general resentment when he told the North Carolina Army that "other additional supporters" – which are held by the armed forces and the armed forces — could take action if his predecessor, Hillary Clinton, won the election and was allowed to vote.
According to Trump's campaign staff, the media broke his statement into context and Trump was not encouraged by violence.
In his case, Bordeaux called for an immediate response from the campaign and an immediate response from Phillip to the persecution, ill-treatment, and suffering caused by them.
The trumpeter's informant Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a message asking him for a comment.
Phillip didn't mean any business.
Charlotte's local news agency WCCB told Phillip about the campaign.
The request for an immediate response from the Innovative Consulting Service to the Phillip consultancy firm was not received immediately.
The presidential vice-president of the Republican Donald Trump has launched a controversial campaign.

Britain should use the Olympics to extend Heathrow
Heathrow also sustains the economy and creates prosperity – not only in local communities and London, but throughout the country.
This was the most interesting thing for me in Heathrow. As in the 2012 Olympics in London, we strongly pointed out that our entire nation and all our regions are benefiting from it.
The Olympics benefited greatly from Stratford and East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
We are afraid of local communities that we will create 10 000 new educational facilities and 40,000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in areas near the airport.
As in the 2012 Olympics in London, there are always people who think Heathrow's expansion is too large a challenge.
With regard to the Olympics, I heard that Britain would never be ready for them and that we must face a difficult situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong about Heathrow.
The obstacles that can be overcome are always countered, but Heathrow answers each of those questions.
Like Olympics, Heathrow is also an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than rarely.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and increase the economy by 211 billion dollars, resulting in expertise and employment, as well as the environment of the airport and the United Kingdom as a whole.
We have a powerful working group at Heathrow that has been implemented during and on the budget of 11 billion red infrastructure investment programmes, which includes the T5 terminal – which has been voted for by the best of the year for two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal that was built at the center of the world's two dedicated thanks.
Now they are ready to produce third thanks, which is supported by a private investment of 16 billion pounds.
The Olympics in London in 2012 had a great success in our country, and I am sure it will also be the extension of Heathrow.
We have time to use the same Olympics for Heathrow's expansion so that we can ensure our trade future and create the skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the president of the Heathrow Government and former Minister of State for Finance's Trade.
Adblock Plus and Facebook news service in X-ray games
The efforts of companies that earn their money from the network have been transformed into casinos, says one Estonian company.
In Torstana, just two days after Facebook had announced its own anti-commissioned advertising programs, Adblock Plus would publish a blog post where it said that users could update their programs and thus prevent the public service's claims.
On the other hand, Facebook reported that it changed its desktop page to make it more difficult to recognise the features of the page.
Now Adblock tells us, however, that he has discovered new codes.
Adblock's rapporteur, Ben Williams, wrote in his blogging that "such a distortion of open source code between the public service community and trainers has been on the move since the notice service was found" and that it is possible that Facebook will make its own repairs soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of how the major concern-makers have been formed into the field.
Worldwide, 200 million people are using popular services programs, reports Pagefar and Adobe last year’s research. The number has been almost four-year-old since 2013.
Facebook uses 1,03 million active users every day on mobile devices, and the share of mobile content in Facebook is already 84%.
However, the company intends to contribute to the launch of popular software in the desktop application because, according to the informant, mobile devices are not operating on Facebook’s mobile applications and Instagram.
The results obtained from Desktop Preferences are still large enough, so Facebook was therefore considered to support your presentation.
On Tuesday, Facebook also reported on its up-to-date list of user settings so that users can control more about how they are addressed to them.
Torstaina Facebook criticised Adblock's new followers, as it also prevents them from seeing some normal Facebook publications.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem," said Facebook reporter in his e-mail.
"The Master Service programmes are fragile and ineffective and therefore we have contributed to the development of user regulations such as rating tools so that people can control their own position."
A woman committed suicide by leaving cars under a light motor
The victim died in the middle of the night on a motorcycle.
The police are asking for the help of the eye-witnessers on the motorcycle tortoise for the first few hours of the accident, where a woman was left wanting more cars.
The accident occurred on A1 engine in Vaud's station near Morgesia shortly after midnight.
The woman did an act of misconduct by putting her back on the dark road, and she got more cars to tell the Vaud police when they reported it.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and his aim was clearly to commit suicide. A group of passing cars also had a truck.
A woman died in an accident.
According to the police, many accidents involving those car drivers have already been challenged, but some are not yet recognized. The police are asking them or other accident monitors to report.
Lakimés Gilles Hofstutter, in Le Tribune de Geneva, says that the crime investigation has been initiated, which is a logical step in this situation.
However, it remains to be seen if, in the event of an accident, there are complaints against those car drivers.
"Is it impossible to avoid noise?
It's going to be for the prosecutor to figure it out," says Hofstutter.
In the last five years, two similar cases have occurred which are not regarded as responsible by the car owners.
According to the newspaper, in each case the person was walking on a dark motorcycle and the right was decided that the drivers could not wait to break their bike at night.
In the last year, the police authority was released from the charge against him, which had been raised from the death penalty against his wounded man who was lying on A1 engine near Payinnera for one night of his stay in 2014.
The court heard that at the age of 22, the victim had enjoyed a lot of alcohol and had gone on the road.
The Court held that the police – who had been in response to the emergency – had been justified and the man who was on the street had been "full of exceptional and unpredictable circumstances".
A number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 will be requested to call the police.
NASA airstrip: Venus has been life-threatening
According to NASA's new climate estimates, Venus may have been alive.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model that allows Venus’s past to be examined using the same tools and algorithms as scientists use.
The purpose of the model was to determine whether the conditions in Venice could sometimes be similar to those on the ground, even though Venus is covered by heat and water and its gas is almost entirely composed of hydrocarbons.
According to the researchers’ presentations, the slow rotation speed of Venus is explained by its mass at the gas station.
On the basis of the latest simulation, however, it may be assumed that Venice has had a danger, the Earth-like atmosphere, and it has slowed down in spite of it.
Malia was also used to solve the former Venus surface formation.
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but there may have been a need for water and geographical change to sustain life and prevent rapid evolution.
The ancient Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent higher.
"In the GISS modeling, Venus slowly rotates and its afternoon is about two months away from the sun," says GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in the press release.
This warms the surface and generates a hundred which creates a thick cloudy cloudy sky. Pilvikerros acts in a way that makes it possible to protect the surface from large sun temperature.
As a result, the average air temperature is even slightly lower than the current Earth temperature.
With the help of the model, a Venus story was created that answers the previous assumptions of the planetary research on its development costs.
Although Venus may have been alive, however, it has been subjected to excessive heat and ultraviolet activity for many billions of years.
Its power was destroyed, and the ultraviolet power was burned to the ground.
The waterkartes left behind only the heavy carbon dioxide gas and the deadly effects of growth – i.e. Venus as it is today.
Researchers reported on the results of the new Venus weather survey in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is going to replace Avalanche as a volunteer.
Patrick Roy emerged as a member of the Colorado Avalanche team as a preparatory and follow-up director of the waste management team in the decision-making process.
The Coordinating Director of Colorado/Chief Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the follow-up will immediately start to apply for a new manufacturer.
"For the last three years, I have been serving as the Chief of the Colorado Avalanche Group and as the co-chair of the follow-up to the wintertime activities in a generous, enthusiastic and specific manner," says 50-year-old Roy in his report.
"During the summer, I've been focusing on how I could improve the team, give it the necessary depth and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the Vice-Chairperson for the preparation and follow-up of the refrigeration operation must be fully in line with the organisation.
He must also have the power to make decisions that affect the group’s performance.
These conditions are not fulfilled at this time."
Sakic, who paid Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the group.
"Patric told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
"We are grateful for all that he has done for our organization, and we hope for all the good things in the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award for over a year as the best preparer during his first term of office in Avalanche from 2013 to 2014.
As a result, the track reached 112 points and won a central division, but Colorado disappeared in the fallouts of Minnesota and has not been able to continue for the past two years.
Avalanche achieved 39-39-4 operations between 2015 and 2016 and stayed at the top of five points while playing in the second Wild Card place in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame's painter Roy won four Stanley Cupi – two Montreal Canadiens and two Avalanchens.
The oil industry in the North Sea is engaged in negotiations and is central to the economy.
Co-rapporteurs will repeat the termination of the North Sea oil-working wages when all the parties participate in the new round of negotiations.
The Wood Group supplying oil services has been maintained in the North Sea, the Royal Dutch Shell.
According to the Joint Declaration of the Parties, "Wood Group and the Union and RMT establish their appropriate process for re-launching the process in order to make the solution available".
From the beginning of the week, we will be able to hold several long-term meetings throughout the day, which deal with problems from a small point of view.
The employment unions based their recent activity, which they considered to be the first over 25 years, as a protest to any maximum of 30 per cent of wage losses.
Due to negative market pressures, the Wood Group this year cuts the tariffs of its co-workers operating in the North Sea by about 9 per cent.
The company's lower rates are based on the country's prices of employers at 10 per cent in 20114.
According to the company, additional costs will give it the level of mobility needed to enable it to find out the market’s calculation.
On behalf of the shell, thousands of employees have been hired by their payroll and have announced their plan to leave oil and gas supply in 10 countries. This will work to strengthen their activities after their megafusion with the British energy company BG Group.
The lower prices of crude oil and the economic situation resulting from the decision taken by the United Kingdom in June from the European Union create pressures on energy companies.
Mr Dave Anderson, a member of the Scottish Parliament, met with the chairmen this week to discuss one of the biggest problems in the North Sea with the whole generation.
According to him, North America is vital to the economy of the region.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that benefits many and not only rarely," says Anderson.
New projects in the North Sea are expected to cost less than $1.4 billion in 2016 when they have been spent around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of stars in the Plejades Star
The most recent task of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the rotation speed of stars, which has helped astronomers to gather the most comprehensive list of stars belonging to the Plejade Star cluster.
On the basis of new information, astronomers are able to find out why stars belonging to the same star group are orbiting at different speeds and how planets are connected to the planetary system.
"We hope that by comparing the results to other star groups, we will learn more about stress and age and even about the history of the sun community," says Luisa Rebull, a professor at the Caltech University of Infrastructure, in Pasadena.
The Plejade Star Group is located 445 light years away from the Earth.
Many of the stars have been born about 125 million years ago, which means they're just reaching their age.
They're driving now faster than ever.
At the speed of rotation, there is a large number of adult stars at the peak.
These winds have an adverse effect on the stars in their forwards through their magnetic antennas.
At this age its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler shall measure the rotation speed of each star between the next known star points (which correspond to the rays of the sun).
The most recent listed speed data indicate that larger stars rotate faster than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers – larger rotates later than smaller ones.
"We see the Playaden's "dance" that slowly the wheels are typically larger, while the faster the wheels are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Since Plejaden's star group is so close, it acts as a wonderful space laboratory that allows stars to be compared to rotation speeds.
"The Playaday Star Group offers support for the theoretical models of both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want more information about how, when, and why stars slow down their rotation speed and stop their "fucking" dance.
Rebull’s colleagues present their most recent analysis of the speed of rotation of Playadie in three new articles published in the Astronomic Journal.
