Eightteen-year-old chef found dead in a business in San Francisco
Eighty-eight-year-old chief who recently moved to San Francisco was this week behind bars of local commerce.
But the victim's brother says that he doesn't fall for anyone who wants to hurt him and adds: "It's finally started to give him."
The body found in Westfield Mall in the middle of the morning was identified as an eight-year-old citizen of San Francisco Frank Galicia, who introduced the office of a judge.
The San Francisco police department reported that it was violent death and was conducting an investigation.
Brother of Louis Galicia for ABC KGO Station in San Francisco said that Frank, who was formerly a regular cook in Boston, got his job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
The speaker at Sons & Dauters' restaurant said his deaths were "crazed and destroyed".
"We have a small team that works as a family unit. We're going to miss it very much," said the speaker.
During this difficult time, our thoughts and concerns are shared by Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first slept in the apartment, but recently "he started giving it to him."
"He found his apartment, he went with the girl," said Louis Galicia to the KGO.
Louis Galicia said he wasn't hit by anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to join his family, he always burned our food, made us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any fights.
He was a brother who took things the way they are.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an unscathed diamond that struck every day," he said.

The Czech roads invested more than 31 billion vehicles in modernization.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, public transport has invested more than 31 billion korunas to modernise vehicles.
A third of the vehicles are currently equipped with air conditioning, and half of the trains have a new system of closed WCs.
The shares for modernisation in individual years with the exception of 2012 are gradually closing.
In the last six years, the Czech roads have invested more than 31 billion korunas to modernise vehicles.
A third of the vehicles are currently equipped with air conditioning, and half of the trains have a new system of closed WCs.
The money spent was shown to reduce the average age of two years in trucks and private units and six years in classic cars.
Most of the investments provided transporters with 60 per cent of the money in question, and 40 per cent of the company then invested in the restoration of long-term transport vehicles.
The average age of old trucks and units is currently 19 years old.
Modernised older vehicles, however, are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If modernization of vehicles were not calculated, the average age of old vehicles would increase by 10 years.
There are some older ones on the average of personal vehicles whose average age at the beginning of modernization is 23 years.
If only years since the date of production were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
Classic fixtures consisting of wagons and trailers, however, in recent years from Czech and international railways gradually disappear and are replaced by motor or electrical units.
Between 2011 and 2015, Lomotives were killed from 280 to 223 pieces, similar to the number of classic wagons from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in half of the year.
The transporter was particularly relieved of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening of the train.
From January to July, the transporter allowed 110 of these vehicles to sink.
From the investment planned in the vehicle park in the near future, for example, 50 cars can be bought up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to place on the international line Praha - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for the Turkish fast track.
The contract is calculated by taking up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electrical units.
The authorities know about illegal advertising for four years, they cannot release it.
We're very weak, they admit.
For the fourth year of the online daily edition Currently.cz follows the history of the billboard in southern Čečách, which is now a slow motorist to visit Lipna, where it is not only touristicly interesting to walk through the corners of the trees, but also the Olympic Park.
Remote administrators know they're there, but they say they can't do anything about it.
Similar ads are hundreds of thousands throughout the country.
According to officials, there is a charter law on wine which makes it impossible for illegal mobile billboards to be removed immediately.
A complex bureaucratic package is needed.
Meanwhile, the company changes its name and the office is short on it.
Or it's enough to place a few meters of advertising and the official process has to start again.
The direction of the railways and the distance was recognised four years ago: at the main stage of the Czech Budějovic in Lipno, the advertising billboard stands on our ground at the state railway station last night.
Even three months, however, officials did not have enough to remove unauthorized transfer structures with heavy insulated pay.
It's like no one knows they're standing right next to the vehicles in a 50-foot security belt where there's nothing to be done about safety.
The drivers claim that they can't afford to consult with the billboard because of the law of duty.
You should put it on and take it away.
"That's not just what we can afford," says the speech director of the railway and remote Nina Ledvin and refers to the complex bureaucratic circle which the removal of the billboard must pass under the law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose court has begun online journal Currently.cz to look in detail at the yard, but it is not unique and points to a general problem that cannot be resolved effectively and quickly.
Only in the southern Czech Republic have counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed directly at or near trains.
They're similar to other countries.
"We have the difficulty of companies to force them to be removed," the head of the Committee of Transport of the Czech-Buddish National Office of Jiří Klass, whose similar stories are solved by colleagues, confirms.
According to the Class, there is a law of grace that officials agree on.
Before that, the owner of the billboard has to vote for the commercial to go away.
So the chief company is often unavailable or knows the fine that has already been described in the past when the problem began to become more interesting: enough mobile standing with advertising to place a few meters and officials may have a previous challenge to remove the black insergees into the trash.
That's because the office has to specify exactly where illegal billboards stand.
"If someone does not agree with it immediately, it is seen as a new facility and we have to reconfirm it," explains Jiří Klasa.
The new law can't help.
The amendment could bring about a new law which has been banned since the beginning of the next year by the billboards in the distance and limits them on the I. class.
Critics point out that rules to break illegal and easily transferable advertising will remain the same as ever.
And the authorities don't like it.
Companies are still able to make tens of millions of crowns per year and no one can pay them.
For example, the billboard that hangs on Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the Czech-Buddy Master is currently conducting three administrative proceedings for a fully-established billboard.
The company shall be at risk of any 30-year-old account.
It's more commercials that were not allowed to be placed in the safety belt of Class I.
The strike is not over yet, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the Committee of Transport of the Cheskobudjevic Master.
The advertising that is currently interested in.cz is not yet described among these cases, but with the highest probability of coming.
According to the RSD, Ninny Ledvin's company did not respond to repeated written requests for removal, and the case would be made on board by the national and most likely master officials.
The Commerz Billboard company belongs to those suspicious companies that cannot be contacted.
He doesn't pick up the mail and the official seat on Gjjkov has been canceled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company’s mail went to the South Korean businessman Anton Fischer, who had a strong dispute with the head of the Czech representative of Hyundai.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard is located on the Comerz Billboard and offers it to investors, but in the past he refused any connection.
Next year, when the RSD began to issue an article on Lipno, Fischer allowed state officials to send a letter to the secret company Commerz Billboard to his pension where he is likely a new company.
Not one of these addresses has been addressed to any remote administrators today.
It's a fucking fight.
Similar silence or unobtrusive changes in seats are not unusual.
Some years ago, one company, we gave orders for two million korunas.
She just changed her name and ICHO and there was nothing to do with it.
The executioner has returned, the ads have gone on, maybe elsewhere.
We are too weak against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, recognizing under the conditions of maintaining anonymity one of the officials.
The new law in this regard is not yet settled.
Currently.cz spoke with several Members who were in trouble.
They haven't done any activity yet.
On the contrary, the messengers who wanted to extend the deadline for the preservation of billboards in main Czech communications were revealed.
The government denied it.
Billboards are not only national but also national and current policies are very sensitive and some sort of schizophrenia.
On the one hand, he knows about the social questionnaires after their limitations, on the other hand, they need them themselves because they are intruding in bilateral campaigns.
I don't stop the relatively agreed opinion that if something doesn't work, it's necessary to change the laws.
This year farmers are less green, but more fish and mother, estimate statistics.
According to the Czech Statistical Office, this year's crop decline will be 6.7 per cent lower than the lotion.
However, the annual level is higher than the average in the last five to ten years.
On the other hand, there will be a higher incidence of fish (3.9 per cent) and mother (2.5 per cent).
This year's crop cut will be 6.7 percent lower than the lotion.
Farmers are closing 7.2 million tons of oil.
This is based on the estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office on 15 July.
The original estimate was more pessimistic than a month ago and predicted a ten-year collapse against the lion.
The Lonian scissors were grown, but they were too modest.
The annual level exceeds the average in the last five to ten years.
On the other hand, this year it'll be more like a fish and a mother.
Pesticides drop by 3.9 per cent more than a year ago when they reached 1,256 million tonnes.
The mother's annual level could be 2.5 per cent higher than the lower.
The expected decline in seed production is due to a reduction of 3,7 per cent in hectares of 5,71 tonnes of hectares and loss of personal areas.
Farmers lived three percent less fields this year.
This year, the most significant increase for the Czech Republic is estimated to be 3.3 per cent less.
The farmers also sent her to several fields.
However, it will be signed down with a lower hectoliteral output of 6,04 tonnes.
The sum of five-fold declines in statistics are expected to occur in the barley kernel, which is most commonly used for beer production.
According to lower levels, personal areas are reduced by 15.2 per cent, but even less hectareal output.
On the other hand, the eggs are born about 6.3% more.
You're also growing a jelly gland.
The statistical fishing industry estimates 1,305 million tonnes, which is against the length of the sea.
The private areas have also increased by 7.3 per cent.
The hectar output, but it's going to be 3.2 percent lower than the hens.
The annual fishing rate exceeds a 10-year average of 13.3 per cent, while the catch is on the surface of a third greater than ten years ago.
In the last four years, it's also home to a field with a mother.
This year, farmers sent him 35,543 hectares.
By the year 2008, when the mother in the Czech Republic landed on record 70,000 hectares, she was half a field.
As a result of the expansion of personal space, this year's mother's crest will be more rich.
Long-range levels of 2.5 per cent at 27 423 tonnes.
The hectar output, but it's gonna be 6.1 percent lower.
The armed police charged two men with assaults on the knife and the sword, the judge sent them into custody.
The police charged two attackers who attacked a knife and a half-year-old man in the center of Olomouce on Tuesday.
"Because the attacker tried to escape, caused him severe and serious injuries that required hospital treatment and other treatment," said police spokesman Marie Štrbákov.
The two apparently security officers kept the police immediately after the attack.
The complainant proposed the court to take them into custody and the court dismissed him on Friday.
Both men are under three to ten years of imprisonment.
The police charged two prisoners of assault by a five-year-old man in the centre of Olomouce with knife and sword.
The refugees caused him severe and serious injury, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The accident occurred between the two groups of people who took refuge on Tuesday in the right-hand afternoon on the Freedom class.
The Pachatlers ended up in contact, informing Olomous police officer Marie Štrbák.
A group of two families played in the garden area before Tratoria at least in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouce.
After aggressive arguments, two attackers were attacked using the knife and the sword of a five-year-old man.
Although the attacked man tried to escape, he was subjected to severe and serious injuries that required hospital treatment and other treatment, the police spoke.
In the case of a fugitive who had been raised in the center of the city and who had to hold several police officers and guards at the site, there was a family dispute.
The four-year-old criminalist from Slovenia and the seven-year-old man from Olomouce were accused of a serious health and marketing injury.
The complainant proposed that the court be taken into custody and that the court be brought to trial on Friday.
Macet was used in the centre of Olomouce during the combined battle of the attackers also five years ago, it was then just ten metres away, just before the Vana discotheque in Riegrov Street.
At that time the police reported that a group of ten foreigners had attacked a host of companies who were standing before the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, holes and cats in their hands.
The judge after two attacks by aliens has been subjected to a conditional charge.
The abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you'll go around them every day.
One of the most critical examples of an unused and empty house is the building of an existing IBB headquarters in the middle of the Old Town.
That was supposed to work like a hotel for a long time.
It's still nothing.
That it's necessary to put new and new apartments and offices in the metro?
And what do you use existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the centre of Prague in the Václavsk district, there are several Chinese houses, which, despite their position, size and often memory protection, are only empty and empty.
The property in the centre we selected using the project Prazdnedomy.cz that maps long-term empty property in the Czech territory.
Homes are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, unobtrusive relations between companies or members of a state that is unable or unwilling to free them.
Empty houses are more than homeless in the Czech Republic.
Let the owners pay special taxes for them, he wants to take the initiative
At least they shot Fidel Castra and lived here with Hitler's brother.
The writers showed another Small Side.
A buyable apocalypse.
The U.S. malls are empty.
On the way to Prague, they don't know.
Karlin was a luxury town.

Clinton's husband's loan was $10.6 million.
The troops refuse to publish their tax recognition.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million a year.
More than a million dollars were spent on Clinton's charity.
Most of Clinton's revenue - over six million dollars - is for their show.
The troops will refuse to publish their tax recognition.
The candidate for American Democrats to Hilary Clinton's presidential office published his tax statements on Friday, which increased pressure on his Republican opponent Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million a year, announced the AP agency.
Most of Clinton's revenue - over six million dollars - is for their show, mainly from the period before the autumn of 2015, when Clinton started its campaign against elections.
The tax report showed that Clinton's husband has taken the federal tax on income of 34.2 per cent and then the income tax on state and local level of nine per cent.
As a whole, they paid 43.2 per cent of their income.
However, with a similar problem, the company has not yet agreed to publish a tax recognition.
It is certain that Donald Trump will not pay any tax, Clinton wrote on his Twitter a few minutes after his confession.
Clinton's return to the secrets around the Trump's revenue, except to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is really as rich as he claims, the AP agency introduced.
The name of the body is estimated at billions of dollars.
A lower education would damage the history of a Republican candidate as a successful entrepreneur.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is currently running a vice-president post at the dance with the former lady, has published a report on her tax offices in the last ten years.
Together with his wife, Anne Holton, they gave 7.5 per cent of their classes on the charter and 25.6 per cent of the classes on the loan.
The defense again broke out in Nigeria.
Islamists from Boko haram have been preventing the subsequent expectation and have killed doctors.
In Nigeria, cases of child abuse occurred again.
On the northeastern side of the country, the government announced an extraordinary expectation, as there are two children charged with this inability to protect.
The vaccines have been carried out there by helicopters.
In the occupied region, Islamist terrorists from Boko haram, who prevented expectation and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) there, the virus was spread unsightly.
In the northeastern part of Nigeria, an extraordinary waiting period for children against the backdrop is being held there for the protection of two children charged with this disability.
In Africa the defense was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government announced that in the state of Borno there will be a million children and four million others in the surrounding states.
Nigerian military fighters on Friday, according to the AP agency, quickly delivered vaccines against the children's rebellion into the occupied northern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram.
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the virus had been unconsciously spread over the area for many years.
The extremists from Boko haram in the past protected the expectation and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also failed on Thursday to get doctors to the area where children were found.
Both arrived with refugees from part of Nigeria who had recently been freed from Boko haram.
The head of the WHO section responsible for the removal of Michel Zaffran from BBC station said the waiting in Nigeria will start next week.
In the state of Borno, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram has been active for a long time.
The area was made available by international organisations and the government until the beginning of this year, when Boko haram was given a major reduction in this part of the country.
The Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole admitted that the new cases of rebellion were a major failure for the country because Nigeria wanted to announce the next year that the defence had been banned.
WHO has warned that it is possible that although the disease has not developed for two years, it has spread among children.
It's expected now that children will be five years old.
In 2012, Nigeria had half of all cases of the world's reverse.
While the defence was still in 125 countries in 1988, it now lasts only three areas - in Afghanistan and Pakistan and in northern Nigeria.
The pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the stories of the fallen women.
Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who had avoided the gang of dogs by means of police.
The pope listened to their difficult life stories and called them to look to the future with confidence.
The French wanted to warn this meeting about trafficking in people and call for a stronger fight against him.
Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes in Rome who were released by the police from the power of the gang of passions.
The head of the Catholic Church listened more than an hour ago to the stories of fallen women and then chose to look with confidence for the future, introduced the speaker to the Vatican.
Among the former prostitutes who visited Francešek were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is about 30.
All of them, according to the Vatican, were exposed to cruel physical violence during the forced prostitution.
The visitor wanted to draw attention to the trafficking of people and call for an increase in the fight against him, he introduced the popes.
Francechek often alerts people to court cases at the end of the company.
For example, on Thursday he met Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican in depth and in June thanks to his personal invitation.
France's going to hit the Gihadists' factory.
Without the help of Muslims, it won't work.
France is fighting radical Islam with the help of Muslims themselves.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valles is experiencing major changes in the function of the mouse and spiritual education.
Since December, we've closed 20 mice and prayed.
And the others will follow, announced by the Minister inside.
There are over a hundred gejadists in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who abuse public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this freedom," Prime Minister Manuel Walls said.
In particular, it is important to ensure that only property learned in France is displayed in museums and prayers.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding mixing abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from abroad to build new museums, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the country of the Persian Gulf.
As a result, there are also indicators that can solve radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is consistent with democracy," added the Prime Minister.
The key to achieving these objectives will be a new French Islamic mission.
This should work as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
There's no money from the stranger anymore.
In the country, the French delegation for Islam, which was founded by the former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005, is now taking place.
It had already contributed to the review of the financial flows between the mice and the countries which financed their construction.
The institutions soon discovered internal disputes and rivalities.
"It's a total failure," he recently noted.
In January 2015, after an attack on the French political scene, Charlie Hebdo launched a debate on a new institution that rewards non-functional performance.
All of them have recorded other terrorist attacks in France that have been carried out on behalf of the Islamic State in the air-conditioning of Islam.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently heard that a new mission will take place this year in October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure funding from domestic resources and to monitor property.
In the past, it is not clear where it will take money not only to build new museums but also different educational centres.
But it's considered a few suggestions.
One of them is a special fee or tax on food halls.
In practice, the seller would buy food here, which is to provide a certificate.
Some of these money would then travel right into the cash supply.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros (270 to 540 koruna) could then be paid by French tourists who are going to Mecca.
Every year they travel there on a traditional trip to South Arabia about 30,000.
And that's not it.
According to the Prime Minister, only indicators that have passed special education programmes at French universities should be conducted in the future.
This should ensure that the sentence is in accordance with democracy.
We'll close the radical mix.
The French government is currently fighting radicals.
And the others will follow, recently announced by the Minister inside.
In France there is no place for those who vote against and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
In the country, according to estimates, about 2500 muscles and prayers are performed.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are influenced by radical Islam.
Since 2012, the authorities have hosted 80 orphanages and in several other dozens of others.
Not all of them, but they think that the government's steps will be able to take a great deal of action against radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize do the same.
This is not happening in museums, young people are radicalizing themselves on the Internet, says Severine Labat, an expert from the National Research Centre.
Dr. Kelemen lost in the 1st wheel with the star Bauge.
The Czech road biker has to fight in the right lanes on the way to the osmiffinal.
The Road Cyclists Paul Kelemen on Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after the process of qualifying a race between the best of eighteen lost in the 1st round of the battle with the French Great Gregor Baugé, a champion of the past in London.
The procedure for the osmiffinal must be fought in proper driving.
At the start of the king’s discipline on the road, 27 drivers were set up and the best Czech driver of his day had spent the fourteenth best time.
Two hundred and a half years ago, it was 9,969 seconds ago.
In the main planning phase, he was waiting for him to qualify as the fifth Baugé, who already has Ria bronz on the team team.
Keleman finally reached an experienced Frenchman, but he looked at the procedure.
A great performance broke out with Jason Kenny's gold treasurer.
Eightteen-year-old Brit won the third fastest century of history and won the Olympic record 9,551.
Then, according to expected, he also consulted with the latest German Maximilian Levy.
There was also a British quarter in a meeting with Bradley Wiggins, who took a new world record of 3:50,570 and moved to the final.
The peak peak (3:51,659), which was four years from the Olympics in London, improved by more than a quarter.
Young doctors press: They want pure wind in the area
The representatives of young doctors agreed to accept new steps in their dispute on a new contract.
The Youth Doctors Council (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) must request the whole Council to support other medical activities from the beginning of the harvest.
JDC says that ministers have not been able to deal with the issues of the contract.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted against the BMA contract.
58 % of its members who participated in the elections were rejected.
In a letter to the members published on Thursday night on Twitter, JDC President Ellen McCourt stated that the government remained "remaining silent" on matters which were too much to refuse the contract.
She said: "In this light the executive authority of JDC has decided by voting to reject the proposed new agreement completely and to request a new formal meeting on all issues."
In response to the government's silence today, the JDC Executive Council formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council with a view to approving the current programme of dedicated defence actions from the beginning of the meeting.
Sport led young doctors to report to six stages this year, including the first general stages in the history of NHS.
The leader of young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malavana, rejected the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
BMA members at the meetings before the vote of 54 000 young doctors and medical students said the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said that the contract would mean hardship for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: Union of "indebted"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met in the morning to hand up their hands and announce the formal end of eight months of long-term war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish opposition to the overcrowded palace hall in Petrohrad, I had the idea that Ankara wants to mourn for this more.
It's been hand-handing, yeah.
But Putin didn't smile, and a little bit of it blew out of him, and that's according to his standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Mr. Putinov - five times, as one of the reports says.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to their level before the crisis, but they will be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan was acting like nothing bad ever happened.
According to me, his inspiration was an exact opposite.
But the persistent cold that emerged from Putin showed that the Russian leader didn't forget anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening words: the shooting of a Russian warplane Turkish on the Syrian borders.
Moscow's reaction back then was horrible.
Putin broke the wounds around him and accused Ankara of killing Moscow's knife in the back.
The worse it was that it came from a trusted friend.
It will be difficult to rebuild real trust, perhaps even impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state's controlled media has led a massive global campaign against Ankara in one month.
Suddenly it seemed like the Turks could do anything.
More serious was the charge of senior state representatives that Erdogan's own family had benefits from illegal slave trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic state.
This one's got a lot of trouble.
But in Petrohrad, an official message came that it was time to move on.
The end of the meeting came only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared some victory as well.
For Ankara, the results of the statement are quite clear.
In the first row, Erdogan was almost out of power during the last month of the unexploded strike and therefore needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also been seen as well.
There is also economic motive.
Russian sanctions had a strong impact - in particular the destruction of charter flights that carry several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast every year.
This figure has been reduced by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, the tour of operators and charter companies here will be quiet when it comes to the renewal of the years.
They're working on the Mediterranean road movement at the end of the season.
Even this week's national television promised more light fruit and vegetables when the agricultural comedians were allowed to import from Turkey again.
"Tourists there, Rachat back here," according to a report in the Vedemos newspaper.
The visit, however, had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is evil in the West for what she thinks is a cable reaction to trying to turn.
In addition, the long-term non-violent discussion on EU entry into and entry into Putin - which focuses on how to make easy use of and overcome Turkey's path to the West.
The Russian leader certainly won the bonus points when Ankara asked for help from the elected authorities after the shot.
You must understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of changes in the regime, this is given.
So the summit in this pompey, coastal Palace of Russia and Turkey allowed me to imagine what one of the analysts described as "unconformity of the unconformable": how two countries that feel rejected and used in the West are connected.
Despite the public show of mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently played a role in peacemaking, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
It can be said that after almost three-hour initial discussions, both Presidents at the press conference indicated that they had not even mentioned this issue.
The Turkish President gave a clear answer to the question of the differences between them, while Putin decided to lift those differences.
There is no clear agreement on which both States could find a joint statement on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and in view of the risk of a simple disaster when a member of the NATO was shot by a Russian warplane - it is certainly better that both leaders speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside of Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS sign shall be attached to the back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will lose its customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS sign was linked to global ambitions of banks.
She moved away when she was almost eight years old and had to be redeemed from debt.
At that time, the strategic characteristics of RBS were used to protect the other characteristics of consumer finance.
Millions of frees were released for sponsoring international sport, from the six-nation football champion after the Winbled Andy Marraye champion.
Now, however, it was decided that it would be better to make more out of the national flag.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but will not allow new businesses.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of central and coded operations on the bridge, will be changed to NatWest.
For customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the Ulster Bank symbol is already used.
There are other, less signs for private banking that will get more ahead - Cutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During our trip to customers and employees in Inverness-shire McEwan answered Ross McEwan questions.
BBC Scotland said: "The RBS sign will cease to be our investment mark and the sign for which our employees work because we are now becoming more and more bank sign."
Since the bank itself became a global sign, it also became a global sign for RBS.
Now I'm saying we don't have global aspirations, we have efforts focused on the home scene.
Each of these signs will mean something quite different in their own communities and our workers will work under these signs.
The RBS has already indicated that it will not continue in its sponsorship of Six Nations champions, has prepared a profile of individual signs of sponsoring sport.
"It has been a good time for us to move to a bank because the basic question (which we are expecting) is how to focus on becoming a better customer bank?" said the Executive Director.
Three years ago it would be very cynical if we said we were going to become a great bank for customers and they presented these signs.
But together with our focus on customer needs, not our own, I think there's a lot of change.
We can recall these signs again, I think that the right time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on the Predillection horse led to the 3000th victory
Detor discusses the Spanish after which the second victory in Newmarket has brought to him 3000 victories
Zackie Frankie Dettori won 3,000 wins in Britain in Newmarket on Friday.
This lover won his second victory tonight on his local trail - on the Predillection horse, which is trained by John Gosden.
Fifteen-year-old Italy is a six-year-old who has achieved this result in equivalent gains.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddy and Willie Carson.
A three-year-old chess champion named Dettori, who once won the Ghaiyar horse, said: "It's special."
I'm very smart 'cause here's my family too
I'm so glad it came to Newmarket because I was here 30 years ago.
It's not a huge action, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I'm sorry, and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects gratuillas when he brings Predillection after victory
Two jockeys of this mill arrived in the obstacles - Richard Johnson's champion and a 20-day champion for Sir Anthony McCoy's pension, which led to more than 4,300 winners in his career.
Lester Piggott, 9th winner Derby, 4 493 winners in career
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times, and it's not surprising that he got a mileage that only a few passengers got before him.
He's stylish and strong, but he's just his tactical fissure that distinguishes him from the other drivers in the tank.
He's been a great ambassador for ages, his inspiration and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frank in Epsom that if he didn't just eat about the weekend and the big ones, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
The truth is, Frankie won a win in Great Britain for most of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He has a living attitude that is good for British sports, but most importantly, he's an incredible joke.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his historic summer harvest
From the summer endings after the summer harvest - Frankie Dettori was a succession of British equivalents of about two decades.
It was like riding on a mountain road.
He survived the disaster and had a ban on starting drugs, including his famous "great sevens" in Ascot.
Three years ago he first stepped back after a six-month ban, but proved an incredible internal force and returned to the best form of doubters.
And maybe it won't be the last time - Dettori already announced that he'd like to continue in the race for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin missed the head of the presidential office of Sergei Ivanova
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly abandoned Sergey Ivanova on Friday as head of the presidential office.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest employees after many years.
Thirty-nine-year-old Ivanov was appointed a special representative for the environment and transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin "has freed Ivanov from his service to the head of the Russian Presidential Office," but there was no reason.
His place is Anton Vayno, who has been Ivanov's representative since 2012.
Forty-four-year-old Vaino was a diplomat.
Born in Estonia, Tallinn in 1972, he was promoted at the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked on a mission in Tokyo.
On the websites (in Russian) it is stated that he later did the head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
When he had named Putin, he said: "I thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities of the Head of State within the meaning of the proposal for laws and control of the extent to which your instructions are respected.
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov asked her to leave the post and recommended that she be rewarded for it.
A witness to smiles?
This step completely mystery Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest employees of Vladimir Putin and also Putin worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on State TV, both men announced that the presidential office's position would go to his own request.
But smiles into the chamber convinced only a few people - especially now, in the face of parliamentary elections.
So it's about the effect of a fight on a lot of people?
No one knows that yet.
However, the official claim that the man who was once considered to be a potential president was suffering from a sudden shift in Russia's environmental policy met with great distrust.
On the Kremlin pages are the comments of Putin, in which Ivanov says: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you to give me this very important post, even a problem post, for four years.
I seem to have been the head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov's post was seized in December 2011.
Formerly, the Vice-President of the Government and the Minister of Defence has been suspended.
He was a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the Committee on State Security (KGB).
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was very much the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which was replaced by the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
When Putin came into power, he named Ivanova one of his five closest employees.
It was even estimated that Ivanov could become Putin's successor to the state after his second election, since the third period would be anti-institutional for Putin.
But this post was taken by another close Putin's partner, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin returned to the presidential office only three and a half years later became prime minister.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the crime series, was released after the director's arrest.
Gibson was involved in the physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The ABC and CBS television stations which produce the series announced its release in the joint declaration.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, spoke on Thursday before his release.
There's been creative differences in the scene and inconsistencies.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in a statement.
According to the ABC and CBS TV stations, there are details about how Gibson's position will disappear from the series following the experiences of the FBI's staff members, something later.
The forty-five-year-old heretic who celebrated the main role in the Dharma and Greg summit has been active in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the thoughts of crime, and for the last twelve years I have given them my heart and soul," Gibson said in his statement, which he published on Friday.
I was hoping I'd be in it by the end, but it won't be possible now.
I would still like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, heroes, our great team and especially the great fans in which this show could be expected.
Return of the series to the 12th series is expected on September 28.
In the town of Banff, they were pleasantly attached to the fishing garden
A man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain is thought to be 75 pieces of fish can be the sandy burns that left the watery death there.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a short film of his invention on Periscope's Canal in the opinion that someone could help him explain how about five centimetres of fish were caught in his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Now connects with Fife
The project for 1.35 billion pounds should be completed by May 2017
Engineers spread the northern surface and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge now connects with Fife.
So it's the first of the four conclusions between the “pills” that are now almost completed around each of the three pilons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
There are 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of iron.
The project for 1.35 billion pounds should be completed by May 2017.
Economic secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the fortress to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
On this project we are all witnesses of how construction engineers actually used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the conclusion between the passageduct and the flat bridge was a delicate operation which required extraordinary accuracy.
In its place there are now more than 79 % of the total area of the bridge, concrete for the last part of the area is now moving to Rossyth, so the whole area is ready for lifting the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first conclusion of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this marvelous project, this conclusion is a reflection of Earth's position.
After installing the last part of the road surface and its connection to the expanding North Tower area, we then had to close the last line on the north side - towards the stability.
We've done this by crossing the north approach over 700 millimetres south.
This was massive and at the same time very delicate surgery.
Massive because the diameter is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and it was necessary to pull it down by about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerance he worked with was very small - only a few millimeters per direction.
It all went very well.
Saved in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy to Be Alive"
Three men are "happy that they are alive" after the water from their fishing boats at England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue team announced its outbreak on Friday at 13:20 a.m. of the British summer after the group saw the incident in the Moelfre port.
All three men tried to get to safety while their members continued to be irregular.
"We have seen their members circle around them and attacked us the worst," said rescuer Moelfre Vince Jones.
"The strong wind took her away from them before we left," he added.
Two men saved the local fishing vessel, a third man aged 60 was found without a saved suit worn out as a fighter.
All were transferred to the flag of the coastal rescue member and transported back to the station of rescue members
Jones said: “Three men are happy that they are alive and totally free of injury.
The engine had a run for emergency exit, but somehow it came to its removal from the person who drove the crew when it came to conversion.
Someone who's mad at those who want to keep their hands safe.
The court refuses to resolve the case because of the woman of Tlucho.
Petr Tluchoř is one of the three messengers who, according to complaints, were to receive from Prime Minister Necessary and his former head of the office of Jany Nagy's political traffic, thus a lucrative post for political action.
In 2012, the approval of the tax package was granted.
Snigger, Fuks and Tluchor made it possible by their rejection.
Then they appeared at influential posts in state companies.
Therefore, they were also suspected of paying and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, it was wrong, and the damage was almost 2 million dollars.
The fat now appears as a witness in the case, and this is after the trial of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a court building on the fruit market and settles civil disputes.
However, she wants to be a judge of the King Helena (solver of criminal affairs - rev.) and to present her with possible intentions.
The case is likely to be brought to the attention of another Prague court.
At the same time, the King has already forgiven Jan Necess, formerly Nagay.
It was about the fact that the military intelligence was used to track the first wife of Prime Minister Nedjas Radky.
In this case, Tluchor didn't figure out.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, it's about an extremely controversial reaction.
I believe that impartiality cannot be shown in such a way that the court is excluded if the Witnesses have a wife or a judge.
I'm afraid he wouldn't be able to judge anything. He'd notice for days.
"I think it's cute," he added.
In the case of political traffic, Roman Boček, former officer, is also accused.
According to his lawyer, Petra Toman, however, the appropriate object would have a chance of success.
The Court of Justice for Prague 1 filed a complaint on 13 June by former Prime Minister Petra Necces Jany Nagy (Today) and other accused of using the Military Report.
There's no time with her husband to the court.
The fat man was supposed to solve the productions about Perutsk.
For example, the wife of the delegation was to judge President Miloše Zeman's case on the democratic premier journalist Ferdinand Perutk.
The Earth said he was sympathizing with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schools is already dead!
The girl must have lost her connection forces at the airport.
She and her two old friends traveled to Syria by train from the London airport of Gatwick.
The British Ministry did not comment on her death report.
The young Londonese who fled their homes were secretly transferred to Syria through the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana were targeted by the media for their next former colleague from London School of Bethnal Green Academy.
The case of Lonia has called for a huge wave of attention and also pressure in relations between Britain and Turkey.
The British security notes that about 600 British Muslims have so far gone to Syria, from about 50 young women and girls.
A number of them joined the IS radicals and other groups.
Those who return home represent a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream job for hundreds of dollars.
Great job, you don't even need a high school.
So it looks like it's the first time I see a witch's job.
And often on the other side.
However, the output is not only extremely high in Czech terms (in Prague you work in IT up to 180 000 Kč), but also extremely high in favour of the benefits.
The reason is a huge lack of IT specialists.
There's a thousand specialists missing.
It is estimated that almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
Among the most searchable are the statistics of the staff agency graffton programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
The candidates can choose between a number of job offers.
It is therefore not opposed to candidates for a position of employment, but to the position of a candidate, comments Jitka Souchkov, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
High school isn't necessary.
School education, however, is not a necessity for teachers.
High school education is a good foundation and is an overall indicator of the intellectual and educational well-being of a candidate, but it does not often have a common knowledge of development.
Developers have to keep learning new things, which once studied high school does not reward, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
It's going to take place in Prague.
There's a lot of street people moving everywhere over the Republican media.
They'll come to Prague and Brnä for the most money, and there's no such emergency in the regions.
"The weather conditions in Brn are comparable to those in Prague," Kubačka confirms.
They'll get the technical director at the highest level.
In Prague and Brná they can reach 120,000 - 180,000 Kč.
In other regions, the pay is lower, but not less than $80,000.
Questionnaires are also IT project managers.
On the move they can make 60,000 - 100,000 KZ.
The fight is about absoluteity.
While in some professions, graduates must often express themselves equally to the office of employment, they do not pay for it.
If these companies take over and reimbursed a specialist from another company, they would like to see the graduates.
They can save him according to their own.
They won't get married without language.
The knowledge of a foreign language takes place in every profession, but there is a need for at least a hearing English.
The knowledge of at least one foreign language is in some IT positions of necessity.
On the other hand, we meet with many cases when companies are looking for a highly educated and experienced person and are only satisfied with average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, the staff member controls more foreign languages, he is interested in his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, he will provide the Director of Kubačka.
Josh in Googlu, there's paradise.
Only quiet can more often find employees in Googlu.
Of course, it is a generous working time for them, the possibility of working from home or various cuts, not just for mothers.
"Innovative fathers are given four weeks' leave after the birth of their child," says Martina Jonek, a Google speaker.
Hungry also carries health care for employees and families, food, transport, training, wellness or massage directly to the workplace.
Anyone who wants to learn has a green and no matter what a new one wants to learn.
But that doesn't end the benefits.
Such a full refrigerator free of charge is certainly not to be taken for granted.
Healthy meals (in some places including breakfast and dinner) are available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called microcockets in all offices where people always find a healthy variety of words.
And if there's nothing going to happen, as soon as it gets cold, she gets into a box that employees can take home tonight.
And the reason for these inconsistencies on the Czech scale is incredible?
Create creative and motivating environments!
"It is not important for Google to sit at the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, actions or development, ideas and innovative solutions," he adds.
The UN has strongly criticised Bulgaria for the criminalization of refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN Human Rights Commissioner, accused Bulgaria of systematically violating the human rights of refugees.
The Bulgarian government's official strategy "causes serious concern about Bulgaria's non-compliance with international law", Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
He noted that "it is particularly disturbing to be a witness to the importance and impact of public support for criminal armed combatants, who are being ordered by the authorities to flee to the border between Bulgaria and Turkey".
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who go to the Bulgarian territories are automatically caught," Zeid stressed.
And what's worse - often they're punished and imprisoned - for a year or so - if they're trying to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria's year has been held by 14,000 migrants, and the same period is 21,000.
Pokémon Go - Hung for health and happiness that will be paid
It's fascinating to watch how the world changes.
A number of people during the last decade complain that teenagers and children are no longer playing outside and prefer to spend free time in front of the screens.
Pokémon brings people out of fear and leads them to activity.
Time spent in front of the screens was originally frozen on television, later on video games and most recently on smart phones.
It's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not exclusive.
Of course I'm talking about the fashion that is Pokémon Go, the application is based on the posts that first appeared in video games at the end of the 1990s (there was a drawing series, playing cards, and so on).
Like many cultural phenomena, before this new game was introduced at the beginning of July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand to lose interest.
The introduction into other countries was then delayed because of the possible interest which led to overburdening of servers.
Pokemon won him over a few days more users than Tinder and almost as many users as he has Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smart phone are going out looking for Pokemons that are following the help of GPS, and when they find them, they can "photo" (through screenshot on the phone) or "get".
Manie caught up with a generation that played the game at a young age, taking her out of the seat and the woman out looking for Pokemons.
In the United States, this game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps that a "mean" person will do every day.
The Cardiogram app for smart hours from the Applu, which follows 35,000 users, recently announced to Washington Post that within two days of the release of the game, the number of people who followed each day for 30 minutes increased from 45 to 53 per cent.
The company has no information about who's playing Pokémon Go - sees only gross data on level exercises.
Many public campaigns aimed at ‘finding 30’ people, ‘ getting out of the hole’ and ‘active every day’ fell on informal ground because most of the public health messages are boring and determined by people who don’t look good.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is part of the control of weight, high blood pressure, sugar and a long list of benefits that we cannot include here.
But the beauty of Pokemon Go begins with people going out and doing something they're playing.
You cover three health pills - movement, clean air and sunflowers. And fun.
Some people even get new friends in the middle of the room.
As it is, of course, these nude patrons will be found who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can enter the door.
And what, like?
It's half past midnight.
In their time applications for smart phones such as Fitbit might have been able to monitor our activity, but they didn't give us reason to do something like this in this game.
The newspaper looks forward and is interested in it starting to fall back at a certain point.
Thanks to the success of the Pokémons, there will be other games that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people in pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Billes got gold in more women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the resurrection.
Simone Billes is immune to this.
It's dynamic on the skip.
No clues to the store.
They've all been hired by the simple.
It's all right. It's all right.
And now finally the Olympic champion.
In the fourth quarter, the 9th century American Gymnastics crossed the direct road under the title of the bull and the other on the full window under the Olympic reflectors.
The overall outcome of 62,198 clearly confirmed her defeat before the silver medalist and member of Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliyo Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday at the event at the stadium in the final number of individuals at the sports gym at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Billes became the fourth American in a series that won more than one, and five in total, when she confirmed her story of the best benefits of her generation and perhaps even the best.
When her total final assessment was on the table and her long journey to the end of this moment, she appeared on the face of the sun.
This success leads her to the same league of single athletes of her time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to her sport:
Billes’ sport has dominated her for the last three years, won 15 medals on world championships - including 10 gold. Her impressive compositions are mixed ambitions and precision and Olympic champions from 1984 named it "the best prize she's ever seen."
The last test awaited her in Brazil, not between Billes and the rest of the racer, but between herself and her load of too much expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring in Texas with a hand full of gold medals would be considered a betrayal.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman are engaged in the victory of gold and silver medals in the final of the women's increase in the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
The first Biles received Tuesday, when she was as a plaintiff in the celebration of the leading national team coordinators of Marty Karoli.
Billes insists that during his long journey up there she never looked before, which is not so completely true.
Part of its composition in simple - the one that contains the typical third salad with a double spin - is based on a Latin song that would just fit home into the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not an accident.
The girl was adopted by her ancestors as a ball and her talent was discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman's journey to the gym where Boorman's training took place and where he gained strength.
The competition has not been won since 2013 - this is the result of the victory that can continue as long as Billes wants.
Although Mustafin's taking over for a short walk thanks to two circuits, it was just an illusion.
Cladina and simple - where Billes is enthralled by the world champion - are waiting.
She got back to her head with 15,433 points per column - and finished with 15,933 points in simple terms.
Raisman was very angry with her when she was waiting for final scores - only formality - and about three-footed red, white and blue walls were discovered by Billes when the hopes were fulfilled, which she used to write into her diary as a child.
The Raisman's performance was so little paid for the Olympics four years ago when it was about the third line with Mustafin, then it was the bronze because of the count of three best components.
This time, the twenty-year-old captain of a team that Americans call "the grandmother" was pretty forward.
After her simple donations, she sent a gift to the air bubbles, caught by a return that sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Billes' contribution, which this nine-year-old athlete placed this week on Twitter, where it became a real hit, is completely new:
Police: Three victims in the case of a serial killer shot when they heard music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a girl died at the age of 12 during the most important ten-year attack, in the case of the first serial murder in Phoenix. They were shot when they sat in the car, told themselves and listened to the music.
The authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and daughter Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot in the car parked on the way home on 12 June.
The report states that the armed man stood on the side of the driver and fired out of his gun eight hours ago. Then he jumped into another vehicle.
According to the police, they are not a three-year-old killer because the attacker did not take the money or the amount of $2,900, which one of the adults had.
The speech police in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the investigators found out that the shooting had nothing to do with any of the previous four attacks.
In two major Spanish districts, a total of nine attacks took place in four months, during which seven people were killed and two others were injured.
"It's happening in the villa square in front of the house," Howard said earlier this month for the side of the KPHO station CBS.
The police are thought to have used several cars, including Nissan's ring from the late 1990s, black BMW from the late 1990s and White Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to produce evidence that the attacks were related and were committed by the same murder.
Ellis (33) was transferred to a hospital where she later suffered injury.
Liner (31) and Ellis' daughter Maleah died on the spot.
The Witness told the police that it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a report on the shooting, which meant an empty delivery only half an hour before the triple murder. The police are thought to have been the source of this serial murder.
The explorers found the boats and the rest of the ball in the seat and made the ball under the hood of the engine.
The mother of a six-year-old child with microcephalitis: "His attitude improves"
Edmund Piccito, like most children of his age, loves music, toys and of course also his mother.
But unlike his species, he suffers from microcephalitis, which is the result of genetic disorder his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, as the first one I thought I wouldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
What's not even true - obviously you're preparing for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund may never know and that he may not survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a facility.
"My first reaction was that I thought people weren't doing this today," Picciut explains.
Edmund's coming with a walker.
He couldn't sit down or play until he was three years old and still doesn't talk.
Some limiters are already filling up a little bit.
She's coming with help and she's driving.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and loves music.
Elizabeth introduces a sign saying, using what Edmund says, "please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," said Picciut to CBS News.
But it's not a common sign word - says Edmund invented some signs himself.
Microcephalie may arise from a number of different conditions: genetics, as in the case of Edmunda, and after infections in pregnancy caused by such viruses as fever or Zika.
The symptoms and prognosis can be eliminated in a major way.
It's too fast for us to say how Zika's virus will affect the lives of the infected.
Picciut's memory of the quote tax that he's choosing is uncertain about the future.
I keep asking myself, "What's going on?"
What's next?
And it's still not certain.
In fact, I never asked myself what the whole forecast is because I don't expect anyone could even tell me that.
Piccito's got an encouraging message for the mother of all children who suffer from inherited defects caused by Zika's virus.
It's getting better.
You know it'll be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rain and floods called for rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
A strong rain and extensive flooding in Louisiana allowed the governor to announce his emergency status on Friday. Another rain was expected on Saturday in the state.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) announced that after extreme links, a series of rivers flowed south of Louisiana and in southern Mississippi from their shores and threatened with widespread flooding.
The Government of Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that state officials are undisputed in contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to the reached areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the government's national security and preparedness for the crisis situation, said they're getting requests for vehicles to ride in water, crews and sandbags.
Steele said that only the Tangapahoa cross asked for 10,000 peats with sand.
In most of South Louisiana, the waterways will remain working on Saturday.
The meteorological service in the declaration indicated that the sea could expand further about 8 to 13 centimetres above sea level.
In southern Alabama, there was a water mark in preparation on Friday when the rains continued in the area of the city of Mobil.
According to the predictions, the Committee's river in Baton Rouge and Amite in Denham Springs has to climb on the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said that they both said they could sail a number of houses in the local areas of Baton Rouge.
He further pointed out that it is dangerous to have a flood in the Ascension zone when these dissolved rivers will just drift into the Maurepas.
Tickfaw says something south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level of local time on Friday at 9:00 a.m. on Friday morning.
The rescuers continue to draw people out of private waters in the village of Amite and Wilkinson on the southwestern side of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his own son were already five of Gloster's survivors.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 metres from his house, quickly stopped overnight.
He said he warned him of his next son's incapacitated, who lives near him.
"We woke up and the water was approaching," said Hansford.
We've got her until she's gone.
According to his wife, it's the highest hunger she's experienced in the last 48 years.
Hansford said he and all his family were defeated and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford indicated that the crisis workers saved all three large freight cars in military style and transferred them to the Nazi station in Gloster, where they stayed hidden on Friday.
Krautmann said that by continuing the waste rain forests, the floods are "faster" and the authorities consider evacuations.
According to Krautmanna, a observer near Livinston announced that from midnight till Friday morning there were 35 inches [35 cm] of rain strike.
Krautmann said the ground is very hot from the middle.
The authorities indicated that the extravagance and paid roads required the rescue of residents from their homes during Tangapaho and the cancellation of education in five school districts.
The side of the WWL CBS station announced that 200 houses had been flooded by an old man from Tangapahoa.
The citizens were evacuated to two churches that are both but now flooded.
The old town of Robby Miller reported that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals that had been trapped by high water.
In the city of Amite and in the city of Hammond there were arrangements for those who were evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water begins to disappear," he said.
In the area of Tangapahoa in Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed because of the water, and local people were able to access a well with sand that could be dug up and tried to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"We had the last major floods here in March," said the city manager Lacy Landrum.
Looks like these floods are going to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, manager of the crisis situation in Harrison County, Mississippi, said that there is still a constant rain on the coast of the Persian Gulf.
He said a few houses were announced on Thursday, but on Friday none of them were present in the report.
Keith Townson, leading Shopper Value Foods in Amiti, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in a few places I've never seen before," said Townson, "and he's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "a boy shot like a solution", survived the shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, six-year-old Hoch was shot in Philadelphia. This week, one of the second shootings on the child is already in town at the age of 6.
Her cousins identified her for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaje Brown.
The parents say that the boy suffered several shots, including weakness, legs, legs and chests, but he was unconscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He shot it terriblely, his little body was shot like a solution," said his grandmother's station, Delores Mellendez.
I can't believe it.
The boy was in a critical condition in the hospital and underwent several operations.
The family at the station said the boy should get well.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of primary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three more men were shot: two at age 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men aged 29 is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, there are two other victims in a stabilized state.
According to the report of the station, a child was shot at at the previous seat of the vehicle along with a nine-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car and the police were testing whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
The investigators at CBS Philadelphia reported that it was likely that the shooter had arrived between several armed men.
A weapon of the attack type, belonging to various weaponry, was found on the site.
According to everything, it's definitely about the ongoing battle.
On the street, there was a fighter on both sides of the walker.
It seems, then, that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved here," said Captain Filadelfs' police chief Anthony Ginaldi to the station.
There were also several homes and vehicles in the area.
No one's been detained and the police are probably investigating videotapes from the camera.
Another six-year-old boy, this time a girl, was shot into a bag of broken shots in front of the house near the West Oak Lane.
The girl's getting drunk and the police are still looking for suspects.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's exactly how I present myself to the women's team for the annual Olympic Games, and that's for a few reasons.
First of all, I've been on every summer Olympic since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, there are three prizes in this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, who inspired so many young girls.
Everyone is proud to be composed of this team that complements Aly Raisman, who is the Jewish origin and the Catholic Madison Kociano.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also confirmed the presence of black and Latin Americans at the top of this sport.
The number one in the last four years was an African.
Simone and Gabby were on the first floor and the second floor.
That means something.
On the last Olympic, Gabby Dougal's surprise became a champion of Olympics and America.
The world could now be a witness to the unbelievable performance of the three world victories of Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who presented unexpected but mysterious Gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became a fourth American who obtained gold in a woman’s number of singles.
And Aly Raisman's team member got a lot of stress.
We're witnesses of the sports summit, but it doesn't look like that in the hours of gymnasium in the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie graduated from the Olympic team on the same path as Aly and Madison.
They are “the final fifth” because the team will be composed only of four athletes, and this is the last year when Martha Karolie is training.
The reality is, however, that gym is financially affordable sports and gyms are mainly trained in private gym clubs that hold parents who pay fees for training, training, travel, rents, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their beliefs and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the area that can support activities.
These clubs have all the gymnasiums and for families the gymnasiums and gymnasiums are a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, both coached the athletes at the time they started at the gym.
It is our duty to bring the exercises of gymnastics, which are more available and accessible communities of the number of young girls who were inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I set up a gym class 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free gym or with low costs in Harlem for over 15,000 young people in the city (especially the Black and Spanish origin) and we trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and learn from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and body coordination and hard work, discipline and decision-making.
This combination means life-threatening benefits for good health, success at school and at work.
The inspiration of this team will send us thousands of young girls who will want to make a gym.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for having demonstrated "girl strength" and you won the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origins to get out on the road to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Following Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter further stages
The ministers hoped that, following the conclusion of the Treaty, representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would come to an end with a change of mind. But 58 per cent of the 37 000 young doctors who participated refused the contract.
Hunt rejected plans to break the contract in July with NHS being in "no-one's country" and further delays would have a harmful effect on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend work procedures with a view to improving care in non-social hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, president of the BMA Commission for Young Doctors' Declaration last night, said: "Young doctors continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contracts, particularly in the sense that they will increase the current labour crisis and thus the fair treatment of all doctors."
Eight weeks before the first group of doctors enters into the new contract, progress must be made and time will come.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiation met with the unaccompanied presence of a doctor and often with a heard silence from the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this opportunity is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt now has to act, press on the trigger and solve the concerns of young doctors."
If this doesn't work out, young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last stages at the end, almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were delayed because sisters and specialists were invited to represent doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that following the conclusion of the Treaty, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would come to the conclusion of a change-related dispute.
BMA wants to pay more for a week's work for 54 000 young doctors who would be the subject of contracts.
Daniel Mortimer, president of the NHS employees, called a young doctor not to enter any stage.
Mortimer said: "The campaign will be only a little or nothing, but it will result in pressure on such already overburdened teams and services and increased concern, frustration and abuse for patients, healing staff and their families."
Over the past two months, we have been working with young doctors' council and with the Ministry of Health, and others have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervisor and informant.
Employees hoped that continuing positive involvement in other important issues - such as weighting, flexibility in training, other training for those who return after a break-up of careers, training costs, mutual recognition of objects, study freedom and differences in wages between sexes - was evidence of the fact that employees, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health will take agreements with BMA reached in November, February and April.
Your doctor may reduce your risk of heart disease by 60 koruna per day
Thousands of patients at risk of heart disease will be able to use medicines that are estimated at approximately 60 kroner (two libres). The authorities recommend that more patients be given longer.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of bleeding in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now administered 12 months after administration of the infarction to reduce the risk of death or other seizures.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that human treatment be given over four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog Nice recommends giving people four years of age to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease each year, and a quarter of them are still suffering from heart disease or heart disease.
Infarction and death are caused by the accumulation of fat that creates a relevant species on the walls of the artery.
If it comes to the removal of this species, it can lead to the cause of a blood vessel, the blockage of the blood to the heart, and the cause of a heart attack.
If the attacker is released, he can continue with the blood stream, block the flow of blood into the brain and cause the brain to die.
People who have already developed heart disease are exposed to a higher risk of another stroke.
Ticagrelor, which produces the British company AstraZeneca, which is sold under the trade name Brilice, reduces the risk of being less likely to result from the attack.
The proposed NACE Directive, which was published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg in combination with aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are four patients who had heart attacks and who reach another heart attack or death - often with devastating consequences."
The fear of packaging may have a significant negative impact on the quality of the patient’s life.
It has been shown that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of other cardiac arrests and deaths in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased that we can expand the options for treatment available to thousands of people who will be able to take advantage of the offer of Ticagrelor.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - in particular on the risk of bleeding - are limited to three years, it is not recommended in the proposal for treatment over this period.
With computer culture, submerged in Muslim areas
The old city of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was fired last year because of corruption, which was linked to government news
The culture of political correctness has led to the overhaul of floods in Muslim communities, which is now mentioned in the government report.
Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticises police, electoral inspectors and consultants for ignoring the abuse of voters because of “ethnicity and religion.”
The former Community secretary, now the leader of anti-corruption practices, said that fear of voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police should make corroded and sought-out voters safe in front of the electoral rooms.
He recommended that lovers take evidence of guilt with themselves and be able to prove who they are when they are.
At the present time, it is sufficient to enter your name and address.
In the report, it is further proposed that the person's fingertips be presented with a non-smoothing intuition in order to make it possible for someone to love it twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
It calls for greater access to the documents of the meeting and decisions taken by the informal committees or working groups.
"It is not only about protecting against voluntary bribes but also about protecting the local government from the wider corruption environment and financial underminings that are going to do so," he said.
He requested a report from Downing Street as a result of the election scandal in Tower Hamlets in western London.
In London a special election court decided, the managing mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed from his position after being accused of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "synically touched" his Muslim community's religious sense and held back his criticisms of racism and Islamophobia.
According to his words, Rahman “proceeded his campaign to be the religious duty of the Muslims to vote for him.”
At least 300 votes were questioned or as a result of theft of identity when a person votes and appears to someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of groundwater throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern over the issue of the correspondence vote - which states that the older members of the Muslim community had developed pressure on people to vote for the candidates they chose.
Sir Eric, on the picture, gave several recommendations on how to clean the electoral system, including the presentation of evidence of identity
His report states: “There has been evidence that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been forced to vote in accordance with the will of the elders, particularly in the communities from Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"The concern was that... the state institutions have been able to prevent such behaviour due to "politically correct" sensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric has made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including that political activists are forbidden to manipulate with correspondence and thus prevent "voting."
The report now evaluated by Theresa Mayo also requires more thorough checks on registrations in order to prevent the use of voluntary lists for immigration waters and doses.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to submit evidence of authenticity before the vote.
The use of non-smoothing ink on a person's finger when voting to make it happen that someone will like it twice.
Implementation of systematic checks on the nationality of persons in order to ensure that they may wish.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to three years.
To prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating with rejected correspondence votes and electoral probation.
Give the police the right to create around the polls.
Amendment of laws to make it easier for developing persons to be affected by illegal pressure under the 1983 reform law.
Disable photo sorting in favorite places.
Require that only English (with the exception of Wales) work in volunteer facilities.
Send training and ensure that employees comply with the rule that volunteers go to the polling booths individually.
Sir Eric criticises the London police and says it's "surprising", that in the case of Tower Hamlets there was no charge of criminal acts.
"The Court excluded Lutfur Rahman and his LITAN agent for corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty of having doubts - in the strength of evidence of criminal activity.
It also criticises the inexhaustible "control of racing lines" in the Volcano Registration Divisions at the workshop.
Sir Eric said: “London’s judgment in the case of Tower Hamlets is an insult.
Our nation has a proud relationship with Parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and hidden proliferation of electoral substantiations and the status of refusal by some authorities threaten this reputation.
Distortion of Kate's Cyclistic Double Initiation and Other Twosomes of Known Olympiad in Rio
Olympics of the Olympics in Rio 2016 this week wandered into the French cycle of Pauline Ferrand-Provot, which is still quite similar to the guide from Cambridge.
But the four-year-old Olympic is not far from the only athlete that is moving about the year about gold that can be accommodated by its own double of several famous personalities - at least not according to social networks.
At the celebration of the Olympic Hermes in Rio and all the famous personalities that are currently appearing on our screens, the FCC has made up a list of Olympics that are more than a distance of similar Hollywood celebrates.
As a hunting animal: A member of the American team of shooters Brady Ellison (left) was compared from a small to Leonard DiCapriov
According to the Kate double on a cycle route, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain luxury could be the twin star Leonard DiCapria.
U.S. Marshal Brady Ellison has been working on Twitter since his photos were taken, which probably resembled a Wall Street wolf.
Brady himself noticed the media madness and admitted that he had heard about his likeness with Lee since he was a kid.
"I don't see any great similarity except you," said Brady to Huffington Post.
"It's a guy and looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be more highlighted this year: an ideal match between the British jumper Greg Rutherford and his favorite hero, Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian actress Aliye Mustafin with her big, great eyes was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimwear Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of Gell Matthew Morrison's series for several years.
And for the change: The user thinks Nathan is the "Athletic Version" hero from the movie Home (Inception)
Another long-term comparison is the comparison of the tennis stars of Rafael Nadala and Prince Josh Hartnett, who have similar sharp edges and edges.
The Russian silversmith Yulia Efimov is not only climbing the same table and blonde hair as Annalyn McCord's. And about Nathan Adrian of the United States team, fans say it looks like "Athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitta."
Women with disabilities: Hope Solov (left) and Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) series have a similar face and eyes
Not only one: Twitter user was very pleased that the similarities were noticed
On the wave theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a similar view of couples
One Twitter user recently expressed his satisfaction over the fact that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solová and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical."
The football star Hope Sol and the series series Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have a truly incredible face and eyes.
Among the other favorite comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jengs' and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of the hero Laura Linney, or the holder of the gold medal for the gymnasty of Gabby Douglas, swimming with his beautiful wide smile, which like copying the smile of Gabrielle Union, star of the movie Bravo, girls!
Commentary of the Olympic Horse Station CBC is sorry that he said about the Chinese swimming pool that "he's gone"
The wonders of medium-lived transport from the Olympics to the CBC station have gathered the development of the performance of the fourteenth-century Ai Yanhan commentary by Byron MacDonald. The film ended at the 4th place of the women's race at 4x200 m free style.
The Canadian CBC station was awarded an apology after one of its commentators said that the fourteenth Chinese swim during the race was "cracked like a smell" and "fucked".
Commentary Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when, at the end of the woman's final staff at 4x200 meters, he began to hide his own views.
MacDonald, who was in the CBC's team of commentators to bring "life," said, besides, "The little fourteenth-century Chinese girl has given it up, you blond."
It's kind of exciting. It's like a smell. It's a mess. It's a mess.
Thank you.
The Chinese Navy Ai Yanhan (14) launched the second stage of the race at 1:57.79 - then on the second quarter of the year, it was less than the Canadian Taylor Ruck and enabled the Canadians to reach China.
The fans in Canada began to call online quickly and were scared by the tone and language that the commenter used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: "The voter on CBC said that the fourteenth anniversary of the "outbreak" from China?"???
The idiot didn't realize he's still sending it."
Ai Yanhan from China at the end of a 4x200 m free-style women's race was described as "This 14-year-old from China has betrayed it, you crazy."
Byron MacDonald's criticism on Twitter came from all sides and many asked for his resignation.
When Twitter users learned how unsensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn't hold back.
Another user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and it sounds like we're a band of racists.
Shortly thereafter Scott Russell, who was sent to the CBC host, apologized for MacDonald's lively comment and said, "We're talking about a comment on the performance of the swim that prevented him from sending."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
CBC finally apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Sculptor Scott Russell did not have to mention the name MacDonald.
CBC then copied and filed their complaint in response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained at the comments of Commentary MacDonald
The station also quickly apologized and published a statement.
She's sincerely sorry that the words were spoken, she didn't have to get into the restaurant.
We quickly apologized to our fans for sending and for what they're watching on social networks.
To make it clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimming pool, not the swimming pool itself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron is deeply sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized for the live transmission and tried to explain his note with the claim that he did not want to be identified as a personal attack.
"I'd like to apologize now for the comment I made yesterday night after the woman's headquarters," he said in a letter from the Olympics to the CBC station.
"I meant the act of swimming and not the person of swimming like that."
"There's no need to say that I didn't mean any injustice, and I'm very sorry."
Customers in Primark are raped by a woman who has recently tried a basement in the middle of the trade
When a woman came out to try out the cassettes at the sale desk in the middle of Primark, they were not buying the security I was looking for.
To make it even worse, she tried to get her size down, pull her pants off and return them back to the rule.
In the course of her visit, she continued and finally went to the shopping center of Bouverie Place in Flocestone to test four pairs of kalotes.
Trade Primark at Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkeston, where a woman tried to throw up her pants before she returned to the rule
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the time in the store, said that after testing the basement, she “dressed again and left the store without buying anything."
She said, “The people were not able to believe in their own eyes.”
She stood in the middle of the store, took off the calhothet rule, took off her own ponchottos and calhotots and set them up.
"She didn't even try to find any discrepancy--just stood there, holding it like an opium."
"Everybody just looked at how she pulled her pants again and obviously didn't like her because she came back to the rule."
She did the same with three others before she finally decided she didn't like anything, she dressed again and left.
"It seemed that she didn't even know who she was looking at - or that she was thinking about the man who should buy the pants she tried."
Ms. Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said: “This is the idea that someone will take the house of a man who had someone else and nobody cleaned it up; that's disgusting."
It happened in the afternoon.
Miss Davidson added: “When she left, I collected things that I obviously tried to get out of sale - which is also the only right thing."
"It would make me think I'd bring new shoes home and find out that she had another wife, she would pull them out and they wouldn't have been selected."
A spokesman for the Primark store said: "Primmark knows about the incident that occurred in our business in Folkestone on Tuesday, 9 August."
All the products concerned were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Against the Attack of Weapons by Krav Maga
The outside world is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com it could be safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mirrachi, a former federation of Krav Magy living in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbery near the distance.
This video will show you how quickly to get over violent traffic, whether it's getting close to you in front or behind.
If he comes back to you, he says, "Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "they have a free way of shooting".
Then you will capture the weapon between your proposal and your arm firmly before you put it in your face.
Then follow the knee into the weak, and while the attacker falls into pain, pull out the gun from his hand, hits her head in the face and starts to go away, while you keep your gun focused on it.
If an armed man is approaching you before, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the fireline, grab the gun and turn it off so that the presenter can't shoot.
At the same time, put the weapon into the force and hit the attacker into the chest, then pull the weapon out of its bending and start to climb, while you're still dying on it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video where you'll see exactly how Mirrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the most dangerous way to get from crossing - if you are not the owner of the Maga – is to issue all the equipment.
Traveler Ian Wright olives the most impressive places in Europe to travel guide
The British traveler decided to make a difficult test of his immune system and the daily reflex - by oiling the most demanding and most expensive places in Europe.
The Moderator and author of the Ian Wright (51), based on Suffolk's Suffolk, drew the strength of his immune system into his euro banknote, wrapped on Piccadilly Circus, the button hung on the toilet in the train and Russian public phone.
Before touching each object, he used the luminometer to show himself and all of us what they're going to do.
The experiment, based on the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strong, also produced interesting results.
The accident of an oil tanker in a train used by thousands of other people may seem quite restless, yet the need for much more harmful bacteria is in fact in the kitchen trunk.
Ian Wright has been talking to doctors and health professionals throughout his journey throughout Europe about boosting the bacteria of the meth flowers and about his own health.
Fortunately, none of what he suffered left nothing worse in his mouth than to breathe.
Ian Wright praised him by testing his strengths on the roads around the world and by eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission he proved his immune system to be completely safe - from public commercials at train stations after the flood
In a film about this, he says: “From childhood I have been very poor about my health, and I have given up everything I could, from the grass after eating reds and baths of water."
He confirmed his reputation in the film.
The only thing he refused was the Spanish public security in Russia.
After a simple age, he showed a value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, clean hands should have less than 60.
A public West in Russia but the oil tank refused after showing more than 4000 units of light, while the clean hands are less than 60.
Ian Wright and Finnish producers of milk products Valio discovered a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strong, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom
In the film he said, "This is almost the most boring thing I've ever felt in the west."
There's nothing more spinal cord than this!
I'm not going to get rid of anything 'cause it's unsatisfied here.
Film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strong was found in collaboration with Finnish producer of Valio milk products.
Mr Wright's company has provided Valio Gefilus, which contains bacteria of milk acids and vitamins C and D, which help people to strengthen iron bacteria and immune systems.
Niko Vuorenmaa, former vice president of Valio for entertainment, jusy and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow up on the commitment and at the same time allow us to explain the probietiques' effects.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up saying "Let's call Ian."
It is said that interest in the health of the strain becomes a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about producers, we wanted to put them into wider contexts - good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of noise health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in health is a global phenomenon and through this document we have brought more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakal, who filmed the film, adds: "Let's say it like this, Ian would lose my respect if he took some of what I wanted to do with it - like maybe that unsatisfied Russian trap that appears in the film."
It was much easier for Iana to get rid of some things, and it's more difficult.
I'm glad we've discovered some of these dirty things."
Valio carried out a study in 2015, which showed that 84% of respondents associated milk sugar bacteria with, above all, ice creams and 58% of respondents indicated that they were at least able to use products containing added milk sugar bacteria.
The family of those who were socially needed before leaving destroyed the building of the city of Saltash in Cornwall
The family of the socially needy left their home of injury at the height of 50,000 pounds after being accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were deported from home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of difficulties against them.
After their violent eviction from home, the authorities of the housing company were shocked when they found out that property was in a state of emergency.
In the walls there were holes, ground cracks were cleaned up, all on the floor were swept away by waste and there seemed to be melted.
The family has already moved away and it's because they live in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, head of housing in Cornwall Housing, said she had concerns about whether the house would be saved.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live this way.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, because this property is likely to lead to consciousness as “not so much as a beautiful part” of Cornwall.
This family is unknown and their names are unknown.
A couple had three sons who lived in their home at times, and the police said that the threat caused by the family included street fights using baseball courts, threats to the environment, drug use, drug distribution and loud screams, attacks and charges.
Skeldon (47), whose name was mentioned in the rental contract, was sentenced to antisocial behaviour in June.
In a number of places in the house that may have been destroyed there have been devastating wastes.
In a home where drugs were distributed in the past, the basic criticism was removed
Neighbors say they saw them on the street, and they called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing moved her and her partner out of the house this week after they had received an additional 11 weeks to move voluntarily.
The neighbors who moved there welcomed the move by saying that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We've lived with them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, they can't even count.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because there was an incredible silence here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice here when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the supervisory manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family could not cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, regularly summoned by the police
Wastes and old toys were in the growing part of the current house
She adds: “It is a shame that the landlord could not accept responsibility for his own conduct and family behavior.
A very complicated case was handled because their conduct was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to be feared by her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, Devon and Cornwall police and the local community have done to inform us.
I hope this step will bring some comfort to our neighbors and at the same time bring a message that we will not tolerate uncooperative behavior.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.
Clean matrice that remained on the ground of one of the bedrooms in the house
Workers will now have to remove a set of wastes that remain buried around the house
In 2014, the police carried out a raid at home and found more than 70 grams of concrete, weight, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon received a bribe when he was found guilty of holding the B-type drug she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was fixed on the basis of her son's house, Leeho Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It's because Tanya and her partner are now living in a private apartment in Plymouth.
It seems that graffiti were reduced in many places of the house.
The police say they're going to force the transfer of tenants who violate the rules of their rental contracts
Angela Crow of the Denov and Cornwall police indicated that the shipment was sending a clear message to other tenants who will continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can act in an accident, and to those who wish to follow such a course," she said.
The Denov and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and non-cooperative behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal frightened after a low crossing of a military pressure aircraft over the beach
Tourists who were enjoying the sunflowers in Portugual Aveir were afraid of death
The plane of the Portuguese military aircraft P-3C Orion flew to an incredible low
The military aircraft declared it to be a good flight and maintained that it was not a threat to safety
At a time when a low-flying passenger landed on a crowded beach, a frightened tourist panicked.
At dramatic events, it is seen how the military aircraft gets to the distance from the sun to the sandy beach in the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to wake up after they woke up a few of the engines of the pressure plane without seeing what was coming out of the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the players who published videotapes of the dramatic transition on social networks, said: "The plane was really low twice and at one time it seemed to be getting worse."
Nuno Arroja adds: "I surfed and really thought my plane would fall on my head."
Tourists on the beach in Aveira were scared when the plane landed from the darkness
The Portuguese military aircraft reported today that the P-3C Orion pilot was on a train flight with a view to identifying fishing vessels on the coast and had to land low because it was the only way to control the ship.
The flight was probably about something worse than normal because of the bad visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the flight takes place because people's safety has not been threatened.
Forest fires destroyed part of Portugal last summer and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese military aircraft reported today that the pilot had to fly low because of heavy fog and smoke from the fires that protected him in view
The flight was on a train flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels in the course of his training.
Half of the funeral services do not comply with the rules.
Half of providers of funeral services do not comply with legal provisions.
The Czech Commercial Inspectorate (CHOI) found this at the second quarter of the checks.
According to it, funeral services do not usually inform the rest of their prices or provide written confirmation of the receipt of orders.
CHOI put 41 coins at a total value of 33,000 korunas.
Her spokesman, Jiří Fröhlich, informed us about it today.
The inspectors found the suspect at 47 out of 95 controls.
According to non-information about prices and confirmations of certain funeral services, products were also sold or provided services at prices other than those collected.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and one seller used an unverified measure.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 koruna.
This was the case with the watches on the urine, coverings on candles and belts that were not correctly marked by mandatory information.
"In view of the continued failure of the law in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
The London school that joined the IS was murdered in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultan, one of three British schools who left London to join the IS, died in Syria.
The legal representative of Tasnim Me Akunjee said that the family learned about her death in Syria a few weeks ago.
The ITV News announced on Thursday that it was likely killed during the Russian Air Force attack in Rakce, which is a rural group in the country.
Sultan was 17 years old and her family said she died right when she was preparing to flee the war - torn country and return to Britain.
"Man wants to believe that the only good for the whole thing - as a message and a threat to others - are real dangers associated with the road into the war zone - is that he chooses people from making decisions," Akunjee said.
Sultan and two other schools from eastern London arrived in February 2015 at the airport in Turkey and then at the bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultany family learned that she had been married to an IS soldier in Syria and had been here for several months.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, he leaves Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Leader of the Senate on the democratic side of Harry Reid says he is convinced that the candidate of presidential elections for democracy Hillary Clinton appoints Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in case of his election.
The Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even though her President Barack Obama had already been nominated in March.
The leader of most Senate Mitch McConnel says that the person who rewards the Supreme Court's Supreme Judge will choose the future president.
Reid announced during the conference on Thursday that Clinton's choice of Garland was deemed to be "with some degree of reliability."
Reid's speech later indicated that he didn't directly talk to Clinton about whether Garland would be named and that he was just speculating.
He evaluated Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want someone else to "wander the ship".
Garland is president of the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Reid said that the republics that block Garland's appointment are "supply" and "pocket" of the Republican candidate to the office of President Donald Trumpa.
He said Trump's not going to the office.
According to the Treaty magazine, there are no calendars for "women and men"
The magazine Treats works with photographer David Bellemera on the release of the calendar for 2017, inspired by Pirelli's 70th calendar.
But instead of isolated famous personalities, they are trying to find another generation top model for their calendar 2017 NU Muses.
President Treats Steve Shaw has already told us this year that his magazine is full of toys from the old school because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing it for women.
Obviously, the calendar is thought to be too.
"We have to return to the display of temporary and classical objects when women and men are pleasantly felt and are going to be inspired by the photos of the female body," Shaw announced in a press release to issue the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can send their pictures online or during open competitions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl lead? Who really buys gramphone boards?
Vinyl loves men's compassion in the middle of the year.
Before you decide to ask the comment section about the paper notes under the pseudonym NoAllOnlyMuslimsIn the Middle Ages, we suggest that this product is derived from actual data.
According to YouGov, so much debate on the rise of gramphones is linked not to the boom of millions who want to love the original possession of a physical object but to the nostalgic age.
Those who recently bought an album on vinyl are most likely to be between 45 and 54 years of age.
Young people between the ages of 18 and 24 are at least likely.
In fact, it is not about collecting the above-mentioned fans - all of it has an emotional dimension: older people who buy grammatical boards are more likely to keep their feelings (56% version 53%) and are more comfortable (69% version 66%).
But are the results of youGo's real?
If this blog had been posted as a television report, it would have followed me by a camera as I express myself into the Russian street in Soho, dressed in a decent seat dress and a broad gesture. Then I would stop, shake my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's look at this."
Let's see about it.
While Soho’s heart is slowly losing its charm and beauty - buildings are now filled with independent sellers, hotels, restaurants and restaurants, Confectures and office needs - a number of fantastic specialised shops with grammatical boards are still being filled.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop focusing on the moment. I'm going to get closer to different men in these businesses and try to figure out what their age is and their emotional comfort.
Stuart (55), a father from Glasgow who I follow from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20 has a meeting in London in the afternoon and looks at the shops to complete a few hours of time.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I think yes," she says.
I've got about 3 or 4 thousand supplies.
All these recordings take away the walls of his apartment - on the picture above (the photo sent me by e-mail, I didn't follow him at home).
This huge number of albums and singles is also thanks to the fact that they can afford it: they can now buy gramophones that they could not afford when they went out, and they buy what he sold in youth and had no veins.
“Many of what I buy is from the end of the 60s and from the beginning of the 70s. These are things that would be issued to me when I was 11 or 12. I was too small and couldn’t handle them then,” she says.
They agree that those who buy food are likely to be intrusive about what society likes, and they add: “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink too much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works in Sister Ray, and he also thinks that a number of customers he meets belong to the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new wave of people affected by media waves. People who heard about comeback and felt compelled to buy their old gramfonboards back.
According to my discussions, the people of their collections were most often released between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their phonograph records and bought a CD check are now selling their CD to buy their phonograph records back," she says.
That could explain the boom of lovers of gramphone records of a certain age.
But what is the specific emotional importance of gramfonic tablets?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find out in business like Ponica that you'll find a pleasant community with similar thoughts in music.
According to the Weze, some older customers are particularly affected by the non-contact payment system.
Some grammatical tape recorders can feel excited in a digital world and decide for a well-known range of grammatical tapes, things that bring back memories of a peaceful awakening.
“I think that carrying out a measure or possession of a weight can bring certain comfort,” Wez says.
I'm a collector, I have it, and I think that's how many people do.
It's an easy way to fill the place in the head.
"We're all like their social workers!" a staff member from a collection of grams.
The ICM study concluded that almost 50% of the people who bought a vinyl album last month had not yet heard it.
According to the study, 41% of the gramophones questioned are never used, while 7% of those bought by gramophones do not have gramophones.
In this report, he must have been seriously concerned about the transition of the new boss compilation volume.
The aspect of "trophy" and interest is something Jonny (42), who works in Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
"Someone recently came and said, "I don't have a phonograph yet, but I want to buy it on the Radiohead board so we can show it to the police," she says.
The percentage of these is not big, but it's coming.
It's more about the product page than about music.
People come to us who say, "I don't have a phonograph."
They're younger people, not older adults, adults who get into it.
Fopp, where at present almost one pair is awarded by gramphone boards, has a lot more diverse visitors when I come.
There's a couple of 70s here, tourists doing pictures, pubers and women in the middle of the year.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as trades used to be - from players instead of the steaming iron is called the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesisers and sex, it is good to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly personal, but the trauma of the heart is hard to imagine when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) spends a few minutes in the Fopp and looks at various gramfoon boards at the bottom.
It's one of those who're gonna watch the show before she loses her temper.
According to her words, she doesn't do much, so she doesn't think she'd pick up grams.
It's worth a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on computers or something like that, but gramphones have their musical... "they're excited.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a trade that probably inspired a new generation of grammatical tablets lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I feel like I'm very busy with girls in my nested jeans and I'm following a group of nightly girls who just hang around the polaroid cameras. Then my father and daughter decide to buy Crosley's phonograph.
On the left is the warehouse whose walls are covered by gramphone boards Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winhouse and Fleetwood Maca: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, based on any average collection of grammatical boards.
No one looks at them - maybe just because they're just decorations and some are so high on the ground that they can't reach them.
It's a "wine trick."
But since any attachment to him could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the Soho deeper for another, it's not too much to worry about.
It is not surprising that the demographic area, where it is likely to be more time and money than in other areas, is also where it is most expensive for the most luxury goods that it has certainly been.
But while I find out that youGov's results are accurate - so at least in grammatical boards stores do not take into account the large number of collectors and lovers of vinyl who actually exist in grammatical boards and online forums.
These people probably work hard at schools or offices.
It certainly doesn't start on Thursday morning by trading with grammatical boards on Berwick Street, by going shopping and by looking at a weird, thirty-year-old fake television moderater that hides behind no touching middle-aged men.
The root root root is the most living converter - video reporting
According to scientists, the fungus has the longest average life span on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies cereals, says that the inventory shows the same age as is estimated between 272 and 512 years and measures five meters.
The court in France refused to sell business in the Jungle Abbey Camp
The Court in France refused the order of the authorities in Calais to demolition dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
During this week’s trial, the Calais authorities stated that the state should be able to cancel up to 72 provisional trades where people in the camp sell goods, from cigarettes after energy drinks, offer hair drying, in provisional restaurants selling tea over 50 cents or basic food for several euros.
The chief's office in Calais argued that places need to be destroyed because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they represent a dangerous source of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organisations have stated in court that trades and restaurants are vital and that the free food offered by the State to the supported association and other groups does not provide additional food for the growing number of refugees in the camp.
Conscientious provisional shops and restaurants often provide shelters and food free of charge to people.
The Court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for preventing people from carrying out 72 provisional trades, but pointed out that the purposes of the Calais Prefecture are "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants have much more role than food for people who "live in extremely reliable conditions."
He said the rooms provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places where demolition was threatened was the camp's coffee shop, the Jungle Book Kids, which runs a non-profit organization that offers 200 meals, English and French hours and asylum advice for hundreds of people who are not in danger of being admitted to the camp.
The children's safe pets signed more than 170,000 people.
Guardian received a letter saying that the closure of the coffee shop would "be for these children who are only 8 years of age."
The charity Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp after the sharp increase in the coming years had grown to more than 9,000 - which is by far the largest in the entire period.
You thought he was dead.
The wolf cross its own lips and the vocal cords.
"From March I could normally train," he said at the beginning of the summer preparations in full force.
What happened to you?
I had an extraordinarily painful lung embolism, and that's why I'm having heart problems.
'Cause when I was at a college in Korea, I didn't know I had some blood problems.
So it's been a long flight to Asia?
I've been in the army for two years, and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me. Nobody found me anything.
Then the soldier got up.
In the summer there is a ruined life, it will always suffer, especially if it gets sick or changes time.
But nothing that would limit me is more aesthetic.
Were you worried about life?
He's got it.
I didn't know I had an embolism last year on the summer tour in the trees, and I couldn't even move there.
I refused blood last night.
The doctors told me it was something else. I was still five days away.
In fact, I thought I was dead in Trees, my friends and my family.
I've seen you somewhere else.
How did you compare that?
I guess I had to live with it. Now it's just going up there.
I know I have some blood problems that I have to look more when I'm flying somewhere.
But he can do anything about it.
Once I wanted to get back to Prebras right away, there were still problems with my heart.
It's all right now.
Since March, I've been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I'll lock it up. I'm physically better at it than before.
What do you expect from the mouth?
I'm glad the party looks good. I know most of the boys.
I'm aware of two other foreigners coming.
We're gonna sit down with people to get this together.
Do you know the mouth?
There was a story about the kidnapper, but every season is different.
Brno was eight years ago, now it's over.
There's a new team in the mouth. There's only a few players left.
It was the last one in extralission, so there's a big room for improvement.
The way we use it, it's on us.
We'll see who's gonna be fired by the first cars, we probably don't.
Is it a guarantee of success for the Brom?
He's already experienced and he's been through it a lot, he'll think of a better place than the last one.
But my future didn't depend on him, I had a deal before.
There were other coaches in the game, I was with one big friend and it was agreed he'd be here.
I won't say a name.
Finally Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for decades, he's been a good player.
He'll move us upstairs.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I love fighting, I love hockey and I'm glad to get an opportunity in not such a spy team.
I was two years in Prebras, but the mouth is bigger than being in the sixth team right now because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a stranger who's already training Australian Boehm in Austria.
What does it look like?
I agree with his circumstances. At the university we played against each other in the group.
And a couple of times we spent together, sometimes we sat down together after the game, so we know each other very well.
We won 3:1, and then I put it in his mouth at the start of the summer preparations.
He has a Slovenian friend, he's a sympathetic.
He's still coming from the American Nadazdin and Brazil Ze.
You know anything about them?
I've been writing to the Americans, looks like a nice guy, Brazilian who's gonna know how English is going to be.
You've been in touch with the American?
It seemed like a good idea to me.
I'm an actor, so whoever makes me, I should communicate with everyone.
I just found out what it's like to play, I found myself online like he's playing, I saw some videos.
He's totally fine. He's a jumper. He's high.
On Facebook we wrote a few messages, seemed like a joke, heading west to us.
How do you enjoy the position of the recording unit?
I didn't want to take anything else.
It's only going to be four and I don't have any idea how it's going to work.
I'd rather be at the center of the scene than take the team away than someone else.
I don't think I'd like to play if I was to be a second player and be committed to it at full time.
How many times have you been one?
Half a year in Prebras, when it didn't go to Kust's captain, he got hurt, then there were money problems, and he left.
Since then we've been up and I've been playing.
In Brn, whose guardian I was, I shot one and two.
He was a great year in the Old City, after which I had a lot of offers and I just picked up the First.
From there I was wanted by Budějovice, but I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short half remains in Phelps' domain.
"Being on stage again and hearing the hymnu is as sweet as always," Phelps laughed and then had his eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and his mother were again in the searchroom, the son of Boomer slept quietly on the ears this time.
I'm living an ineffective week at the end of my career.
It's crazy-- 20 years ago, I started to swim and it'll be after all, he said.
At the end of Phelps' absence of two seconds, the mighty Japanese Kosuke Hagino won a long position.
Bronz got Chinese Wang Sun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from the world's long-distance.
After Alu Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is a third sportser who has mastered the same discipline in four games after him.
After most of the race, Phelps and the next American Ryan Lochte and Thiago Perreira were held in the head.
While the gold miners in the final crowd of the crawler’s fifteenth floor, they disappeared from the medallion position.
The American superhero will have at least one chance of expanding its unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the ceremony, he went to the final race for 100 metres.
The legend couldn't stop Ryan Murphy's country, who won a brand double - after a century he won in Rio and a double track.
At the end of his career, he left 37 seats of Australian sailor Mitchell Larkin, the third of which was finished by Rus Jevgenij Rylov.
While Murphy has only the fifth place from the twentieth century, he has become a significant king in Rio.
From the imaginary throne, Larkina sat, where the same double was given right on the London World Championship.
He just got the medals on the Olympics.
Canadian Penny Oleksiakov and American Simone Manuel shared gold with the Kraularians.
For six-year-old Oleksiak it was the fourth medal on these games, for Manuel's second after steel.
The blue gold was obtained on OH as the first African American in history.
I believe I can be inspirational for others.
This medal is for all who come after me, sport will become love for them and get where I am, says Manuel.
The third was Sweden’s Sarah Sjöström, who won a 100 - foot - long [100 m] race in Rio’s world record and still has strength from the Krauts.
By the end of the sixth world recordr, Australian Cat Campbell.
Japan's first Olympic medal was won by the Persians, Rie Kanet, who won in the 1970s.
There is no valuable stone from the world's mystery, its fourth most important place in this discipline in 2013.
The second storm in Rio won Russia’s Julia Jeffimov, which, in spite of the touching past, has resulted in the non-killing of fans and opponents.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won the court and I don't know why I should always answer those questions.
I'm really tired of it. I said Russian swim.
The right to start in Rio required until the special panel of the CAS sports arbitration just before the beginning of her.
They stopped calling me and I won.
If he likes it or doesn't, or if he has any other opinion about it, he's added.
Herman: Breaking up, we could win.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs lived a special day.
Not until about an hour before the game, we found out who he's going to be up against.
They had to handle the tactical preparation carefully.
And then, in a non-traditional time, they started the little band game number one.
The first set didn't start well, then they hit the opponent, but they didn't hit the end.
In the second, they were clearly better and compared, but they did not get out of it.
In particular, the number of services shown was 10:15 and beating with the Olympic tournament.
"We could have won the Russians," Hermann flew.
How would you rate the game?
Herman: After an unfortunate start before I played, we got into the game very well.
In the end, he flew me into the last balloon with the receipt I used to get used to.
We lost a set that was key.
In the next set, we took a look at the game, another defense, and we put pressure on the service.
In tie-break there was a really bad deal, we took this page.
It was a disaster because we could defeat the Russians.
Case: The damage to the start of the first set, we ran.
We've proven it to be downloaded, but we've missed the boobs.
The second set was great and the third one decided service.
We made a lot of mistakes.
We've given them five points, and it's about five, we've been there for a long time.
It's bad because the Russians were gambling.
How did you play number one in the little court?
Case: Similar to in China in the adjacent courts.
The environment and the atmosphere were different.
There was one hour in the night, complete silence, no music, nowhere.
That was the difference between the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the game when you found out the name of the opponent an hour before the game?
Herman: It was special.
We started having fun at a party without knowing how to fight, so we couldn't make tactical preparations like other teams.
But Simon (Nausch's Uncle) reached the tactic of almost all the possibilities they were there.
He had a lot of papers prepared with a tactic, so after this page we were quite well prepared.
Remember you'd ever start a half-night game?
Herman: I don’t think so.
We've played half eleven, but not twelve.
Russian Birlov's block before playing-off on OH in Rio.
The beach volleyballists Markét Sluková and Barbara Hermann in the opening in front of the play-off on OH in Rio.
Was that unacceptable?
The fact is, since we've been playing the last two games in a group of ten, we've had a regime that's already gone.
This was two hours longer.
It's special, I can't imagine that another sport has a sportsman who has to give his best performance in twelve hours.
But I think we've done the best we could.
We knew it would be like this, but it's not exactly typical and it's not gonna be my favorite time to play.
How do you value the Olympic experience?
Herman: Since it was a process from our target group, it's on the one hand, okay.
We did what we said.
But now I'm sad about the game.
Case: I'll sleep from this and I'll be on the Olympic tournament from tomorrow only positive.
The big brother is here, the first peaceing SIM comes.
Don't miss her.
The new rules shall apply to all persons without Thai passports who, at their stay in Thailand, decide to arrange a SIM of some of the local operators.
So not only for tourists but also for people with long-term visas who work in Thailand, for example, or are married there.
The Secretary-General of the National Communications and Telecommunications Commission Takorn Tantath has yet to inform that there will be no exceptions.
The SIM sales plan was presented by the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
New measures which allow monitoring of their positions are decided by the authorities to take place within six months.
According to Tantasitha, it is a means of maintaining national security which will help to solve the criminal activity of right-wing foreigners.
In addition, so-called tourist SIMs have the aid to discourage persons who exceed the allowed length of stay.
For the sellers within half a year, the SIM side should also reveal a special SIM for foreigners.
The distinction will be just a function of monitoring which will be permanently suspended for the purposes of the persons designated without Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This function at SIM for Thailand is not because you can always be followed easily," Tantashi added.
It is necessary to add that in Thailand there are not any anonymous taxpayers like in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires evidence of guilt.
On the other hand, several years one of the operators released free start-up SIM tourists at airports.
They were so completely anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand also covers ten telecom regulators from other Asian countries, such as Malaysia or Singapore.
They also currently pay for the mandatory SIM registration, although legal use of the monitoring system is not possible.
However, the proposed measures do not mean an obligation for foreigners to arrange for the entry into the country of the local operator of the SIM.
Of course they can use romaning services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be brief.
Operators in the country concerned shall know only relevant network information after crossing the border and after the SIM notification has been made to their network.
So they know their phone number, but they never know about their owners.
However, the difference in roaming prices by local operators' rates is so low that most tourists will also start looking at local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The efforts of the authorities to monitor the movement of foreigners by foreigners living in Thailand have rightly been underpinned by immediate criticism.
Tantsaith eases the situation and, in relation to the protection of the private system, compares to the obligation to provide residence addresses in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a judicial order if it is necessary to monitor specific persons.
Any abuse of the system will be threatened by a more unwarranted punishment.
"If the service provider follows the SIM position without a court order, he will be charged with the criminal act," Tantashit added.
The system should also maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While it is currently possible to recycle a specific number until after the 90-day period, after which the SIM has not entered the network, it would be possible to re-enter the number after fifteen days.
The luxury apartment in the renovation of Vinohradach has a pool and a verifi on the terrace.
Why did you choose to live in a new building?
We've been looking for an ageless apartment where most care about the property of an old manager.
The condition was sufficient parking spaces and indoor lifts, which was essentially disqualified by the old constitution.
Not to mention problem hearing in old houses, trouble with climbing floors, high energy supplies and similar.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
Other interesting visits are found in the magazine Modern House.
The entire interior has been designed for you by architect Lenka Langer and his colleague Kamilo Polák from Artiga's study.
Why did you just say it?
Would you recommend cooperation with everyone?
Cooperation with architects would recommend to everyone, if he proposes to stay from the beginning, it is still a very complex technical process.
The second equation is the interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of the scale of possible materials and are able to trace the interior properly on the basis of the customer's expectations.
We have already worked with architect Lenko Langer on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of the personal recommendation of another client, and given that everything worked well, there was a clear choice for us when we rebuilt our new apartment in Vinohrodach.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We have come up with a large community-based area with a corresponding interest for the four-member family, taken as modern, but no cold interior.
The priority was to bring the apartment together with the terraces and to realize intelligent household management.
And of course, it was necessary to monitor the quality of implementation.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you put yourself in the final form of the interior?
We have approved all proposals, including technical expressions and samples of materials, but the proposal has always come from architects.
At first, we set out what we expect from design, and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to start with, for example copper or images.
I think our collection of mostly Czech authors including Karla Malicha, Karla Vyswila, Václava Słály or Otto Gutfreunda architect helped us to focus on our experience.
The combination of black, white and green wood was the concept of architecture as well as the individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, blankets, textiles, art etc. We then checked together with visualization.
Did you find any complications that you had to give up on your original ideas, or do you want to adapt to the new?
Almost in the initial phase of the project, when we arrived at the building at the moment when it was first possible to appear at the height of our base, they found that the views we had planned really were the foundation of the environmental building.
That's when we changed the text's availability over the night from the base.
The iron was used on the kitchen line and on the roof of the blood wall.
In the interior, wood surfaces are then covered with added skin, such as food and baroque dishes from the Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Do you want any changes here or is there something else you'd like to have today?
I mean, it's about a modern air interior, which primarily fulfills its purpose.
We can't change it, most of the adjustment after moving has been played at the level of the stenciling and settlement of the terrace.
Almost the only challenge is on the ground when we are shown as being too sensitive to the dog's home.
Word architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langer and MgA. Kamila Hornnys, author of the achievement.
To be in the latest stage of the reconstruction, it was possible to complete a new solution within the building and several other adjustments.
For the interior, it is an important element in putting the lights into the surface of the walk and the main toilet.
That's what we got today's light into the darker room of the apartment.
Also direct entrance from the main bathroom on the surface terrace to the USSPA pool is one of the buildings that was very useful for the whole apartment.
It's also a pool and a vineyard.
You're not negative compared to France, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in southern France, a Spanish border.
I've been moving pretty much.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France I studied journalism, which led me to work in one store.
So why did you decide to leave the country?
I started to feel like I'm living in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere between people.
I've come to realize that every French man is very negative.
The people in France have been negative about the situation in general, but it's been even worse lately.
It's interesting that you're referring to just negativeism.
Some people still value this Czech attitude.
Trust me, you're not negative compared to France.
Some people don't think it's gonna happen when they get to France because they don't care about it as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
The big issue is money.
People feel they have little money, but the minimum probability in France is fifty-six euros, which I think is enough.
Now there's also a problem with the conduct of people against Muslims.
It's totally incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor began to look at me through his fingers just because I'm a Muslim.
Like if I were some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to move to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I've been looking for a job, basically anywhere else, and I've got a free place at Air France here in Prague.
I admit I didn't know anything from the beginning of Prague.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me what was going on in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't even know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now and I can't imagine I wouldn't be here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mostly because of the whole other atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't get any negative reactions or gifts, but I have a feeling people are more free here.
That I can do anything, dress whatever and nobody's gonna judge me.
In France someone's always looking at you uncomfortablely, perhaps when you have special clothes and the like.
In Prague I started to seem really free.
I don't think I'm worried about that kind of thing.
Where are you working now?
After working in Air France, I worked for a travel site.
Then we set up another friend's website on which people are offering and looking for shared housing.
We're only going to Prague before, but we'd like to expand this across Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends who are Chechnya from half, and two other Czech friends.
I have to say that another specific Czechity is that it's getting more and more apart from the beginning.
She won't let anyone get to her body right away.
It's quite different about where I grew up.
They're all interested in the South and they like their faces.
It's different here, but I understand it's culturally important, so I'm trying to adapt.
You said you didn't speak Czech.
Is there a language barrier problem for you?
But I've got it pretty simple in Prague because almost everyone here speaks English.
Even in dinners or food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have much time.
And since everyone gets a little bit of communication in English, I don't need to learn a language so fast.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you ever met any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Not really.
Maybe it's also because I work in an international environment that's more tolerant.
One experience is attacking me.
My leader, Češka, once told me about the French football team and made a point: They're not French but Africans.
That really touched me.
But if someone had a problem with being a Muslim, I'd still not get it.
And even though my colleague once warned me about some anti-immoral demonstration.
He said I wouldn't go to the center to be expected.
The anti-Muslim demonstration is partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does your current situation affect you?
Do you need to be afraid that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is that today it can happen anywhere.
I haven't been able to imagine something like this happening in France recently.
And it's not just Muslims.
Besides, Islam doesn't even recognize violence.
For me, people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists protect your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way.
I'm trying not to follow those reports of violence, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm completely different, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met at Jire from Poddebrad.
In the middle of this frequent Muslim association with Christians demonstrated against violence.
Did you record it?
I didn't know about that.
But I understand that people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they should do something like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't do?
Are you meeting in Prague with other Muslims?
My colleagues, for example, are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have a pretty weird talk about Islam, because we're looking at it a little different.
I'm leaving France, so I went to another school, and they must have been taught Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People who are Islam sometimes associate themselves with a woman's underprivileged position.
How do you feel about it?
I don't fit in with the equipment in any case.
Well, I guess it's not.
I'm a woman, I have power.
It's up to you not wearing any head coverings.
For example, ice cream?
And it's mostly signed on the way I've been treated.
For example, my mom is a really fundamental Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he doesn't just wear a hat.
She always taught me that faith is a pure personal thing.
It depends on how she interprets it.
When a person reads the Quran, he should take his own opinion on these matters.
So when I read in the Qur'an a passage that says that God told the prophet to hide his wife from the sight of others, I said, 'I am not the wife of the Prophet; why should I hide myself?'
On the other hand, I respect this, and if I travel to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the bags are required, I'll take it.
Are you planning on staying in Prague?
I've already done it.
I never felt so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm doing great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Praha is the perfect city for me.
A good Muslim relationship with Christians demonstrated against violence.
Kozel's Fencl's wind in Rio led to a series of procedural stories.
The 5th voyages to the sea in brazilian Riu de Janiero were launched by Czech explorer Veronice Kozelské Fenclová.
In Laser Radial class she moved before the final two rounds in 10 places.
This would ensure that the Czechs participate in the final race.
You're picking up the packs like dolls.
They want to compete with transporters.
In order to use already planned transport routes, the television director Matáj Liška and manager of the Prague Music Club Marek Gregor are represented.
With the thought, three applications with a different geographical range were inspired by life.
We released the national applications of the Movement in May.
At this time there are thousands of cities in it and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this first, rather than focusing on foreign, says in the interview for iDNES.cz, a fourteen-year-old manager.
How does the Move application work and who can benefit from it?
You will download it and register it free of charge.
Then you can place the route and information on how large a package you can carry and how much you want.
Someone's gonna ask for a ride that day.
If the route and time of delivery are fulfilled, it shall be suspended and each shall be notified to each other.
At this point, the chat will open where the two discuss the presentation.
How many people do you think you think you should register for each package to always find your own cook?
I don't know the ideal situation, I can't determine how many registered and how many roads it takes to cover the whole ideal and every offer will meet the request.
It's already working on the main roofs and it's more logical than it needs to be on the road between the universes.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are still building their confidence and discover that no one is dealing with the package.
You didn't want to solve this before?
How many users do they have after two months of release?
We currently have about 5 to 6 thousand people who are creating roads.
We think it's a success and we believe they're gonna fight another one.
He doesn't need to be a messenger waiting too long?
We hope that we will be competitive for large conglomerates now only because we are able to deliver something even more on the same day and for price breakdown.
In large companies for two hours, you pay several thousand.
You're gonna pay a hundred and a half here because it's a way someone's already running.
Should traditional transporters be afraid of possible customers' death in the future?
We hope so.
The market has huge potential, supplying large international carriers here, as well as commercial networks where all started to buy and gradually found that quality does not match what they pay.
No one wants to find it in the box. I'm saying he's got a warrant on the side, and it's first in the day after 19 o'clock.
At that time, however, I needed the package for six hours and waited home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won't harm anyone and send out the signal competition to try.
Marek Gregor (41) and Mattij Liška (39).
Not one has ever been involved in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as the director of the music club, Mattij Liška as the television director.
In 2014, Shippansee LTD began to prepare applications that are used to transport packages already planned routes between world metropolis, in particular the aircraft.
In 2015, the project was launched for the processing of the company which created applications needed for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming lasted for three quarters of the year and applications were placed on the market in March 2016.
The Transit applications began to develop in December last year and released this year in May.
This is the local version of Shippansee managed for the Czech market.
Applications for Mesik and Mesik Profi have developed since January of this year and have access to users at the end of July 2016.
The purpose was to do all these applications that are connected one day from the start.
In the Czech Republic, they want to manage their applications and then work with a strong investor to focus more on the global market.
A shared economy is a recent topic and this is a service of AirBnB or Uberu type.
You don't have any concerns about the impact in the area that no one can tell us much about where the dividend is and where the economy is going?
It's the same, just another product.
It is clear to us that if this is to be successful and we're going up there, we're going to take another turn in the economy.
But while someone saves and does, it's not intended to go to the financial authorities and tax controls.
Every user, whether on the one hand or on the other, will be forced to pay his income if he does so.
What makes you think the service has such great potential?
The sender shall deliver the rescuer and the carrier, and shall reduce the costs on the road.
There's this strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
In times of social networks that divide people, we would like this to get closer.
They can create nice stories, people are happy to help someone, and they'll tell themselves about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or bags.
People think that there's been a lack of personal access for a long time, we say about this application that it's human service.
So how do you guarantee that the chicken with the package doesn't break?
Each user of the application together with registration shall draw up a public record and shall enter a bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that provide service and human probability.
The couriers also collect stars based on the assessment of the senders.
We're offering insurance. We're still loading details.
In the event of loss or injury, the security officer does not accept responsibility for the content of the criminal law if there is something illegal within it and he does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find him in a sealed package in his suitcase or 10 kilos of hashish, he will be liable to the consignee.
Is it dangerous to use sensitive data from the database?
Registrations are, if necessary, by the supervisory authority, who will be able to monitor it as the only one, even if we are not able to see it ourselves, data are protected against abuse.
How much money will you get after you've managed to get your wallet in your hands?
The whore determines the price and gets the whole amount she'll tell you about.
Senders shall be counted several per cent more than for the mediation of the contact.
These money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to press on the volume.
And no one can blame the curator for not adding the consignment when it actually delivered it, the transfer and delivery are verified using the QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
What about the size or contents of the pack?
You can carry anything.
We have three sizes, small as a bone of butter, medium as a flat egg and large as a pool of beer.
Then there's no more restrictions, and if anyone has a place in the car, he needs a refrigerator.
Plus has the sender's ability to take pictures out of the package application, so the cook sees what he wants.
You don't even have to go to the ball anymore if you don't want to hide the contents.
You're looking for the missing car and it's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take?
Kamarad got an idea over two years ago, so I didn't pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo application with an international record that aims mainly at a passenger plane.
At that point I told him I wouldn't look for an investor, but I'd like to stand with him and give him a break.
The next year was the development of more credit for the whole product, which was based in London by Shippansee LTD.
But this isn't the version you're focusing on.
No, marketing we focused on Česco, where we are trying to get the application up, because it all had to be born pain and it's always something to solve and improve.
We are trying to respond to the feedback from customers and the foreign market at the moment we do not solve that much.
We know it's a long run, but we don't understand, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the most basic and most expensive application, the other two were their way of upgrading.
The transfer occurred when we said that the national segment could be far more interesting and that we would at least learn this in Czech.
The third application of the Mesek is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to the exact address and to the second end of the world.
It works for the senders the same as the Transport, but the difference is that you see in it as a courier in the form of items on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your mobile.
Application for whores who want to live there, we called the Prof. Mass.
So can anyone be forced out of town to take out the package?
Exactly, the last application will be downloaded to Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on a parental leave, someone who wants to travel to work.
Now, just as everyone's stupid with those monkeys, they can collect this whole thing together.
A person sees where there are orders in the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it must be delivered and sent.
It's cheaper than competition services.
At this time, we are making more web sites that will be critical for companies to send mail, to the web for full information about them, or to create items on the map.
Then we are able to use the services every month.
Are you now fully committed to the project?
It's challenging for us, but we usually have it at work so we can enjoy and develop the project.
We're not hidden from a strong international investor, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other got caught up in it with other ideas and ideas.
Now we're looking for an investor strong enough to be able to swim with us not a Czech market, but who should go with a mini-cool to go with us to the world product and become another large market player like AirBnB and Uber.
The front part of Titanfall 2 is to bring a sorceress of forgotten pasture.
This will set up a second piece and only the game in it will be more than the Call of Duty according to the first information.
The length will move around the standard eight hours and the fill must be derived directly from the first part of the network.
It is therefore possible to enjoy freedom of movement, which includes in addition to running, the possibility of using combat titanium.
In addition to action passports, the game will contain a level of right-of-the-art movement.
They'll remember the plates and include the ribs.
Therefore, they are the main example of double jumps, running after the air and the laundromat.
At times, too, the enemy will need to be liquidated.
There will be no lack of maps of memory and level with special concepts.
For example, it will be possible to pull up and cut down the plates and close the possible door.
That's how you'll be like a fighter.
The time of the game should be enhanced by this, between immediate action and calmer moments for exploring unknown planets.
We're playing Jack Cooper's race dreaming about a pilot's career.
Cooper at the beginning of the campaign with Captain Lastimoso spent on the foreign planet Typhoon, which is inhabited by hostile soldiers.
And there will be no wild beast to approach him.
Lastimosa also maintains fatal wounds in the disaster, and Cooper is therefore given the task of providing the captain's titanium.
His dream of a pilot's career is so full before he's expected.
First step, but battery theft will be necessary for robot repair.
There'll be great conversation with Cooper with titanium.
Players are served as sources of information about the past military, but they will also create humorous moments of professional communication.
For example, if titanium is to dry off all the injuries that Cooper is threatening at the planned altitude.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 brought the Polygnon server.
The result will also be available within two months and Bonusweb will bring you first impressions from the network games.
Titanfall 2 comes on October 28, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ mark is alive, however, the original issue remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changes its name to THQ Nordic.
In 2013 after the fall of the THQ publisher, however, a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and name of the company were obtained.
Nordic thanks to this, for example Darksiders 2 Deathnative Edition or Red Faction Collection.
In addition, 23 and 13 of them have not yet been released.
Thirty years ago, at the time I went to bed, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a younger man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first she obviously tried it for a longer time and then they gave it up together.
He's such a big guy, probably her guy, because she was walking like this before me.
She's totally mad at him.
On those first days, she even changed her voice, had such a girl, a beloved voice.
But when I told her I know what's going on, she just blew it.
But I watched it all.
He went from work regularly to half a quarter, so she always went to three for purchases.
She tried to see him every day.
Later I came to see him in the bar, at work.
How many times did I know they were there?
I took the keys, he was determined I'd get them there.
But I don't know why, finally I've always been sitting at home.
I've never been able to go there, take that decisive step.
You may be laughing at me, but I believe my wife has taken me into her mind.
I think she soon found out I'm capable of doing what she wants.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just such a doll.
My neighbors at the time said they knew about it too.
I was such a fool that I never asked them what I should do.
I was afraid that if it all went wrong, it'd be bad.
That it's all in the family that matters, it's just the daughter's breathing.
So I've always said it, go on and on.
But once I went to his apartment to get something to do with work.
He went there with me and I told him I got an anonymity that he was dating my wife and that he's all right.
I asked him what he'd tell me.
He stood there, pushed his arms, looked down on the ground, and didn't say a word.
Then I met his wife on the way out of business.
I told her that, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond to it either. She didn't tell me anything either.
No one told me anything at the time.
I'm such a man who's never gone too far, who's got a problem meeting someone because she's got to find a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I've always relied on it to end one day.
I told her I'd let her go, and life's going on.
That's right, but it wasn't.
And I've never done anything like it.
I've got it in me to this day.
I used to give it a lot of notice, but I finally left it for rest.
He's still living in the back house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more than my wife, my lord.
She always did everything at home - she was smoking, she was bleeding, she was crying.
She's working.
She's always been trying to make me feel better for no other reason.
And it can be said that it's too long.
But sometimes I want to feed her, cover her, and she doesn't.
We go on walking and shopping together and all think about how happy we are.
But she never told me she never loved me.
She liked me, but she didn't love me.
And I see that he loves her today, it's her God.
And I don't have a life like that.
When it started and I took it very badly, I once told her I didn't want to live and I asked myself what I would say if I had finished it.
I wanted to know if she would agree with it or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought, and finally she said, "But there's really enough room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to create a new French Islamic mission that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim citizens.
Following terrorist attacks, France is fighting radical Islamists and with the help of the government and the local Muslim minority.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who abuse public freedom, it will be more difficult for France to guarantee their freedom of expression," Prime Minister Manuel Walls said.
He's willing to make sure that only spiritual education in France is taught in the country.
He also wants to stop funding from abroad when cash shows come often with gythad's expectations.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wanted to conduct a new French Islamic mission, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim citizens.
The new institution rewards the current French post for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It had already contributed to the review of the financial flows between the museums and the countries which financed their construction.
But soon she was caught up in internal conflicts, and that's why she never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," said Valls.
The new mission will appear to be an ex-Minister of the Interior and the defence of Jean-Pierre Chevénement, which is known as the residence of the secular state.
In France there are 2500 muscles and prayers, about 120 of them serve radical Islam.
Since 2012, the French authorities from the country have hosted a total of 80 Islamic clergy and in several other dozens of others, this step has been taken.
This week, the German police also attacked the Jihadist Spiritual Police.
The natives of the Islamic state were evidently conspiring to fight.
One of them carried out a space where believers likely radicalized and later landed at the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate on a new institution was launched in France, which is replaced by a non-functional task.
All of them endured other terrorist attacks carried out on behalf of the Islamic State by radical Islamists.
The new task will have two main tasks -- to ensure funding from domestic resources and to monitor our own.
But it's still not clear where to get the money, although a few proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee on food halls, particularly on meat from the wounds of Islamic principles.
This tax would be paid by the seller at practice to buy food, which is for the purpose of granting permission.
Then part of the money would travel right to the grant budget.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French tourists who are going to Mecca.
Each year they travel from France to traditional Saudi Arabia about 30,000.
Moreover, in French museums, only indicators that went through education programmes at foreign universities should be conducted.
As a result, their punishment should be in line with democracy.
The government also shuts down radical movements.
"We've closed them since December and they'll follow up," said Interior Minister Bernard Cazenev.
"In France there is no place for those who vote against hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
It's crazy.
His ex-wife seriously wounded an unknown shooter on Friday morning at the shopping center in northern Zaragoza, writes Independent daily.
That shot came after a woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car before the shopping center, where he started shooting.
According to the witnesses, the man then turned his weapon against himself, says the Independent.
She took a woman to a hospital with an unharmed daughter, and she had to take a sanitizer for a man in a critical condition.
The event took place about 11 a.m. in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous region of Aragonia, near local universities.
With reference to the Spanish Agency for Europe Press, the Independent writes that the reason was probably the unsolved recent divorce of both partners.
I mean, we're going to get some water, we're going to get some water, we're gonna get some water, we're gonna get some water, we're gonna get some water.
This year, it's easy, good food, because we're the Czechs, and we've got our tastes and our heads.
And so it's from the summer garden that smells garnished crochets, chicken, veggies.
Not too healthy, not too easy, not too often with the exception of salad or green vegetables.
True, heating is time-consuming and cost-effective, it is also a social concern and no one should be locked in the kitchen.
But there are also other options for making good hearings that make their special chair, their preparation is a small ritual, but there is no need to create a long time, five, shrink or soul.
And they're still contributing to our health.
Whether it is already necessary for home sushi or sashimi, where quality raw materials and a few well-encumbered graphs make it possible for the preparation to be fun and to eat the only real exotic dish.
Like even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Even here, there's a bit of a bit more noticeable burning and leaking of rice.
The paper can only be moved into the water for a moment and then it depends only on the imagination of the cook, how he likes to play with the supplements and supplements.
There's no line like a line.
A number of Asian cuisine dishes are coming out today and that raw materials are usually available.
Including a frozen sugar seal, which is one of the basic ingredients of the sushi supplying sushi or pure rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but the real rose giraffe has a unique pickancy island and at the same time a delicious taste thanks to its secret recipe, according to which it blends from several types of octopus and closure.
It is therefore sufficient to buy the corresponding size box and the Annex with the indicative antibacterial effects, supporting the handling and resistance to the cassava or flux is ready.
Banana leaves.
In particular, they are used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in the service and supply of food within the most diverse opportunities and rituals.
Long-fledged banana leaves are also widely spread throughout Asia and South America as "help" for the preparation of the most diverse cooked, cooked and dried foods that concern them like apples.
The banana paper also gives a specific feature.
We are allowed to buy in stores with exotic fruit and vegetables, even pre-filled into the form of cookies.
However, select only the list of green leaves and then healthy and unpolluted.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare salad from a variety of waffles, sauces and dried oil.
He can also buy another frozen one.
Anyone who often prepares or prepares sushi is likely to know especially a series of nuts.
In Japan it is one of the most important types of marine species, from which it is produced by drying, leaching and drying so-called nori leaves – so payments are directly intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame – a dark green variety growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaido – is also pure and dry and is equally popular as a variety of nori.
By means of those who would not know the mission of washing eggs, Asian women probably use it as a means of breeding after birth.
And even this series of effects has almost amazing effects.
Pure blood, strengthens the blood vessels, even effectively prohibits hair drying and is literally covered with mineral substances.
The dried and crushed wama also serve as a turning point, for example, for the taste of rice.
The clean lines are first allowed to leak into the water, then pour them into hot water, and then burn half a minute.
Then it freezes in ice water, melts in the middle of the bridge and continues to be repaired, perhaps like a favorite salt.
Buying her a ready, hated solution is the easiest solution.
Thus, it is only possible to make a roll with an easy green filling, smooth and light, full of healthy sensations.
That's a long-term bomb.
If you walk away and don't come up with a grilled bull.
Eat well, easy and summer.
The Asians know how to do it.
There are several special raw materials and a little moisture, and you have an interesting fresh food that mixs the taste.
And they're done twice.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of paper, 40 g of white thread, 100 g of green wine, 60 g of salad cakes, 60 g of waffles and 60 g of sweet chili sauce.
The root of the dried coral, the larynx of the black sesame, the larynx of the chilli shell, 20 g manganese and 40 g of the frozen granules, some pine nuts.
First we're gonna get the tapes ready.
We're going to put the rice paper on five seconds into cold water.
Then we'll take her out and wait until she's gone.
In the midst of hot water, we will soon burn the Christian benefits, and in three minutes we will quickly freeze them into cold water so that they will not lose their color.
We're going to put on the allowed paper full of green paper and we're going to notice.
We make up a full set of white wires, markers and salads that we pick up on the nice noodles, laugh at them with a sweet chili stick, add a wet corridor, relax thoroughly and place them on a rice paper.
On the banana paper we place Christian benefits, add notes and finally get a series of waffles, sealed closures, manganese payments, black bags, and a couple of coins.
The British must rest with the silver in the seven-year-old corner, the choice of Fiji takes gold
The successful performance of the Great Britain in the seven-week strike ended with a disastrous step on the last stop, Fiji won in the final game on Thursday night of Brittany at the Deodoro stadium here in Rio at 43:7.
The Fijians presented a master lesson in processing, stockpiling, motions, support games, running on sleep and brutal forces - and obtained their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with an unexpected price of escape in the form of silver medals - for Britain's third on the day - and the British could be on their performance in the inaugural Olympic tournament of the seven-year-old band, defeated New Zealand, Argentina and the South African Republic.
The determined victory over South Africa 7:5 in the semifinal of the same day may have ended.
In its form, Fiji would also defeat a 15-member team in full health.
It's probably not going to be easy for the British network, but they can be glad that at least one of them will have a gold medal tomorrow: the chief of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.
Great Britain hit the road.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost every game in Adelaide Sevens.
There's only one lost here.
This wound hurts, but progress is unstoppable.
Fiji began to grow larger, and the Brits reflected joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other players, it was like running for a number of buses in the movement and the World Cup champions led to 5:0 when the Red Sea was later hit by the Ocean Colinisau.
The weather showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was made.
12:0 and Britain is having difficulty touching the sword.
The great Mitchell tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and stop him from squeezing his body, but only Fidjany failed.
In seven minutes, Jasa Veremalu took a touchdown and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another one after the return and for hours there was still more than 1 minute... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravo went across the small British and got stuck in the bed where he ran.
After the conversion to point 29:0, the stop was followed.
It's like Fiji was born forragby 7s while the British still taught transmission.
That's exactly the way it is.
The British in time made collective changes and the efforts of the Fijians stopped... for four minutes, which was good in comparison with the first period until after the brilliant months of Fiji Josu Tuisov continued.
Dan Norton tried to get a chance for the British, he pulled down to the left root at 36:7. The game had already won the people of the Pacific islands and their fans sang, had trains and dances.
It was hard not to admire the very well-famous approach of the Fijians.
In the final moments Mata Vilame continued his next attempt to win the Fijians.
She called the hunter, the Fijians got drunk, and the British fell on the lawn of total humiliation.
Just before that very day, Fiji won Japan 20:5 in a semifinal, and Great Britain won the South African Republic in a strong semifinal - the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans at the first place in charge, but Dan Norton, thanks to his hard work in the game, ran a defensive line and jumped a second time under the hat.
The great latecomer Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the fifteenth team of England, has won - and finally a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning were inspired by the fight against cancer in the Veslar race.
In these games you won't find more emotional gold - and that's what to say.
From the first visit to the last, during the 220 executions in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another significance in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Although two were sitting in the hall, there were three voices in the boat. When the ship woke up after the cold against the second Olympic gold behind it in the race of women, there was still a voice in the ship with the trainer Robin Williams. They are the first women in the history of the British sport to achieve such a result.
Their movement was absolute, it was their 39th race, in which they remained undisputed.
What we see - two excellent athletes, how after the water cool flight with the elegant labyrinth - does not reflect the attitude of the victory completely.
For every gold medal from drawing is a battalion of helpful hand, which means a piece of hair is different. And no hand was helpful more than the trainer's hand which he didn't know 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to his word, it was uncertain.
I was suffering from cancer of a powerful witch who can operate, and I've been able to perform this operation.
Without surgery anything could happen.
That would be a very bad situation.
Sometimes it'll change your view of things.
It was discovered to Williams in December 2013.
Fortunately, for the whole trio, it was possible to take treatment in early 2014, outside the season, and to reduce this at least - if so we can call it in such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together quickly.
That's what he was up to.
I was in the hospital and I went to the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time they said there were enough steps.
That's how it started.
It's a way to tell yourself about yourself, but this was something more difficult.
Immediately after their victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to control his own discomfort.
Stanining, captain of the king's army, who has his mission in Afghanistan, said: "This week I was with emotions on the ground, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much."
Again, it highlights how much it means to me how much Helen and I worked with him and Robin too.
So far, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anybody, so his big thanks, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't expect a better man for training or a better couch.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose their only race in five years.
Two set up a huge rhythm that their rivals couldn't fix.
Even in the final 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
At least we focused at the moment.
Helen cried, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important to stop losing.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't have to get something famous.
We didn't enjoy today's gun, but we just wanted to get well dressed, go out and win the race that led us.
They'll take a year to think before they decide what's next.
The next week, Glover gets married, she's going to have Steve Backshall's TV well-being.
Now she wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it's my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London it took about six months before they found out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes.
I have a much better feeling than that," she said.
Sitting in the first row at the quality architecture Central Library in Los Angeles
The history of architecture/Southern California Chapter organises meetings with Arnold Schwartzman and Stephen Gee, authors of the new book "Central Library in Los Angeles: the history of its art and architecture".
Gee and Schwartzmann will speak and show the pictures of Bertram Goodhue's 1926 proposal and reconstruction and delivery since 1933 from Hardy Holzman Pfeifer Associates.
The meeting will take place from 14 to 16 hours on 21 August in the Modern Hall in a private school of Southwestern School of Law in Art Deco style (formerly Bullocks Wilshire), at 3050 Wilshire Blvd.
Participants can visit the central hall, the Period Rooms, the Cactus Lounge salon and the Cactus Lounge.
You need to buy an entry first: SAH/SCC members $15, non-USD 25.
Open industrial air in DTLA is waiting for permanent stops.
Celebrate with us the 90th birthday Central Library in LA. What's next?
The connection?
Probably driving people free of charge, says the love of the Rubes taxafie to the overcrowding complaint.
Six taxi drivers and an ex-master officer in Prague are, as the CT said, sorry.
You have set out a number of reports in which you have rejected sub-industrial practices and those who are supposed to be in a group that will be before the court.
You've been a bit uncomfortable about this with the missing actors.
How much is too much for you to hear about complaints from members of the organised group?
I was waiting for him to come to some court.
I'm mostly aware of the judgment.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
It's nothing.
First of all, they should return all the money they've earned.
And they should return them so they'll drive everyone free.
It's some kind of a self-defense solution.
Does this mean that you are not aware of any punishment as effective enough?
It's enough for me that some of them have such fear that they're not working here anymore.
For example, one makes a pingle, another spins a pizza, and the other is full of it.
Apologize can theoretically get two to eight years of imprisonment.
Is this an adequate rate?
I usually have a problem with taking liberty.
I think it's a bad punishment.
Close someone in jail, especially in such a case, it's not funny.
Such people should return the company they took.
In the fourth century, however, people were deceived by the fact that our land was ruined by name and that it was stolen by people in general.
So now they're making a good visit and they're making people feel free.
I can't imagine otherwise.
It would work like a public success job.
Like somebody's going to collect waste, they're gonna get a car and drive people to Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll finally get a condition and it'll be theirs.
They'll find another way to guess.
He studied at the Film Academy of Miroslav Ondríčka in Píska and then at the University of Tomáše Bati in Zlin.
It belongs to people who started with official videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for Stream.cz internet television, where he shares in a series of programs, now prepares the Prague Guide series, which is directed primarily to foreign fans.
This Rubesh is the form of short reports which I prefer to avoid in Prague and which it recommends without fear of using.
Previously started a series with names Like this, City of Underwaters?, Life in luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Prague.
The complaint is about them as an organized group.
The police followed her for several months.
Can such a network of underwater taxiers be designated as a mafia?
They're such sweet mafia, not what we know from Kmotra.
It's more about the mafia -- Juniors, but it's definitely organized.
It's just that they're looking at each other's staff.
Praha's all broken.
I found that, for example, the main facility doesn't like Paris, Paris does not like taxi drivers waiting at Karl Lázný (disko club)
Everyone just looks at their place and every group is kind of organized.
It's obviously about an online network.
However, there are only seven people, six taxi drivers and an ex-master who warned the driver against the controls.
As you're saying, they didn't get out of the street without asking.
So, what's the percentage between the Prussian subcontractors in the taxi service according to your estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
They're still the worst on the street.
I'm talking about, for example, Aleš Rījačk.
It's a man who's really dangerous - in his car, he's driving a telescopic bust, and every Friday and Saturday he's at Karl's bridge and driving people.
When I last ate with him, he wanted me seven hundred miles away.
His police didn't hold him for any reason.
Only a few people from all this big group have been selected.
The same situation is also in other Prague locations.
Sadly, then, seven people have a hard time avoiding the already famous Persian beads that seem to have much bigger dimensions.
Of course it's not for anything.
It'll help, but all evil won't escape, it's true.
Are there taxi drivers who steal foreign tourists, still at the same places you showed in the reports, then at Karl's bridge or in the Paris street?
Yeah, that's right.
In these locations they stand every day, and every day they break the warrants.
He ignores it as a city police, as a prairie master.
It's not even a cocours anymore, but it's a simple hospitality.
Business of Purgatory Taxiers in numbers
However, some of them will be brought before the court if it is only part of the group.
It's half past midnight.
So I have to ask myself: Do you feel satisfied?
If I take it as a satisfaction, it would be wrong because my goal is, and it will always be to improve the center of Prague.
And even though I'm gonna feel like it's gonna be a little better, I'll keep going.
You need to press the door on the other side.
Even if the last crime remains there, we should still do something to get rid of it.
You can't take it easy.
Because it's not that way, of course it's more.
Are you still trying to confront them directly in taxis?
I'm doing tests sometimes, and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught one taxi driver through the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He learned 560 kroner in three miles, although he claimed that it was about 56 kroner (he used a ten-footed trick).
He had a firm, the police arrived, and this taxi driver was so upset that he was still following those cops and asked them when someone finally gave him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver on the taxi meter passed a ten-year notice and stole a 357 crown from the tourist.
I'll tell you, how many double taxi drivers didn't even arrive after you showed the faces of those who counted the ridiculous parts in a short ride?
They're still incredible.
How did it go with the cab driver at home with 56 crowns?
The police sent him away because they couldn't discuss it with him on the spot because he'd put an account.
And it's going to be, I think, a problem in that court (six taxi drivers and one executive officer).
On the one hand, there will be a taxi driver with his accounts, on the other hand, the police.
Only under the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice, the master shall not use confidential records from the taxi service vehicle as evidence in the court.
When I started to talk about their waters, my own taxi drivers warned me about this before.
I'm busy, but he always wanted to use it for reporting.
Do you have any fear that this reality could be protected even before the court?
I hope every judge understands that no taxi driver could drive six or ten miles [6 or 10 km] because he wouldn't be able to use it.
You've been talking about the trick with a ten-year-old watch, especially before foreign customers.
Is it still current, or are they afraid to use this file after publishing your reports?
I think we've made this trick more popular than ever.
I recently had a taxi driver. He was proud of me that he was the positive cab driver.
But then I noticed that from the side of the tax metro, there's a pretty black dress.
When I asked him what he had there, he said, "You know what it is."
If the taxi drivers didn't work too hard, could they be taken to court with their colleagues?
Is there anything you can do from the basement?
You've been talking about how you think they'll always find themselves on your way.
I don't think it can do anything.
But some of these places can be pulled out.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should work more to get them out of there.
From my experience, I must say that these fair taxiers in Prague are overprivileged.
But do they like to go against those who say their service story?
They're hungry, but they're missing their minds.
He can't walk in it too much and can't say exactly what they want.
When these demonstrations were organized (on the basis of a proposal for a complete restriction from the office of adoptor Adriana Krnáčov), it was not very clear what they wanted.
Once they said they didn't protest against Uber, they just wanted to have the same conditions as he has this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It happened that they were just blocking Prague and just the best possible advertising for Uber.
How will you fully assess the approach of the Prague Master in solving the problem of driving?
It's obvious that she had to get into it until the criminal police came in to solve something.
The master was short on this.
They had a card that provided information, which means that the taxi department had been doing its work for several years completely over.
I hope that the officers will be able to track down the final controls of all the weighted checks to find out what he's done.
That's what's going to be the worst thing for me.
I've even been on one control train with him, which I've discovered until the next of their list.
It's been a few months since the last parts of the series were published.
What's the answer?
I'm thinking mainly of foreign fans who are actually the most focused series.
Every time I have foreign friends here, I'll let them see this video.
And then when we go to the Old House, it's amazing that the same people who see at the meetings are really standing.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
But really.
I'd put a stream around them so people could watch them.
The museum of communism right on the street.
My last question is clear.
You're driving a cab when you need it?
Of course.
I'm driving with services I don't have to pay for, but the card.
I'm using services like Uber or Liptago, where there's no running option.
But there's also a lot of dyspnoea that's fair.
I've been taking a cab to the street since then.
The driver said to me after he got into the car, "Well, you're out of your mind."
Bém's being dragged for an Italian tourist.
It was written in 2005 on double taxation practices.
In the same year, some primator Paul Bém appeared on the control train in a transfer for an Italian tourist and immediately on the first attempt by her driver, she ran about two hundred.
The editor of Rubesh had a worse experience.
The tax authorities instructed him to travel from Old Town to Václavský, 820 koruna, which is about 195 kroner per kilometre, as reported by the reporters.
At the same time, the Prague Master established a maximum price of 28 korunas per kilometre.
There are also other surprising sums in the above report: for example, a two-kilometre road from the street of Paris to the Trudzlá stastato 400 koruna.
The expensive rides also provided taxi drivers waiting for Karl's bridge.
For the ride to Angel, which is 2.5 miles away, they're going to have to count six hundred crowns.
The marble smells mostly clean water, which is best without chemicals and as long as it lasts.
The impurities from it are good, even if the spin is sometimes to be put down by a ladder, it should be removed from the loops.
It's not easy and it's not going to be fast, it's close to the restaurant of Vanessa Trost of Oldrich in Hawaii.
Klobouk down front of it: the hole is left in the sand which must go out immediately and come down again.
"The restorer should be considerate, patient and non-profit at work," she observed.
It's not far from her first restaurant job in Frydlantsk.
Thanks to her, for example, the stone pieces of the façade in the last tract of the Fridlant Council, she also restored the soybeans of St. Mary Magdalene in Zattish, Saint Jan Nepomucké in Fridlant, Pietu in the Fridlant District Street, Marian Castle in Frydlant or Atlantic in the spring of the New City under Smurk.
With the restoration of Melchior, Krystof and Katerini from Rederna, it started in Frilant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stones is cleansed from the sole of the foot of the foot of uncleanness and the cross, which is free of the stones, shall be made secure against fall and dust; whether they are cast into the wall or into each other.
He's also waiting for surface contamination and preservation.
The letters on the tomb will be sent back.
"Then it begins to send letters on marble boards with a silver ring of gold," said the rapporteur of the State Memorial Care of the City Office in Frilant Faith Sobott.
There are no records from the past that the tomb would pass some corrections.
I'll take a closer look at the openings of the marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old and it's about the rest after the funeral.
He was rich, disappointed after the Swedish invasion of the Thirty Years ’ War, everything disappeared.
The letters were broken down, known as Sobot.
In the Church of the Holy Cross are restaurants with a peaceful roof like a home.
After the spring of 2010, it was necessary to place in order the reservoirs that had emerged under the water, the baptisms were restored, walled furniture in the grave and now the cemetery.
"We would like to leave ourselves in the future," Sobot said.
The church is otherwise in a very good condition, each year to maintain and fix the money.
The restoration work on the redundancies will reach a total of 128 thousand crowns.
They'll be played by the poll, and no money will be invested in this part of the recapitalisation.
Hundreds of thousands of crowns are just going from the win in the national round of the 2015 Historic City competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns are then the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, explained by the old Frylantu Dan Ramzer.
The representative decided to release the win for the restoration of the prize.
The views of experts on future development in selected foreign markets followed by an index and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) in a one-month and a half-year horizon.
The markets are dominated by low volume and growth.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year?
The U.S. S&P500 index, which ran 12% of the correction today, is at a new historical level and has already contributed 7% since the beginning of the year.
Again, the iron rule is confirmed that traders should never go against the interests of central banks, which have always reached their end.
In a situation where American action at the historical level is so lost again, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets are calm and free of fear grew thanks to the quantitative release of the American Central Bank and when the same volume index (VIX) remained stable below 12 per cent.
And not to be.
While the Fed market continues to prepare for a gradual increase in levels, the quantitative release in Europe and Japan has been in full progress and has also contributed to the Bank of England's work in the past six months, which will buy a debt of 70 billion pounds.
The new wave of quantitative release, therefore, is already pushing down so low that it will contribute to almost complete elimination of the risk and fear of the future.
How long will this situation last?
Of course it's a million question.
At present, however, there is no risk, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without greater training, the situation on the comedian market and China is stable and Brexit is no longer essentially the subject, so we should not be too surprised if American action is still under such a peaceful regime.
I'm sorry Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I'm very glad my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and rewarding assignment.
I wanted to say for this difficult work of the experienced policy, the European Commission chief Juncker said when the French policy (which was really experienced, because of the most diverse international political functions, we would hardly look for a better example of European elite) called the European Commission's main mediator on the terms of departure of Great Britain from the EU.
Juncker's selection of the footnotes hopes that the EU is in serious interest to look for future forms of friendly co-existence with Britain.
However, most British media adopted the name Barnier as Juncker's military act.
Barnier is a rocklike European federalist.
Great Britain hates it.
As an internal market Commissioner (2009-2014), he was concerned about the reform of European banking law.
He drank it as he could only take it: a closed enemy of the English concept of free market and the model of capitalism.
The existence of multilateral regulations was a co-founder of the so-called banking union concept and was opposed to all that came from the London Financial Centre City, which passed legislation to suppress the rigid regulations of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the debate with London, will be a strong, impartial and apparently independent mediator.
That's probably not good news.
As in this context do not mention the calm and friendly division of the Czech Federation, which contributed so much to the resolution, review and empathy of Prime Minister Václava Klaus.
And so today, Czechs can be the closest friends and allies.
Unfortunately, Juncker from Václava Klaus - at least in this - didn't learn.
That would be for everyone!
The earthquake around Putin?
Governor Kremlin missed his neighbor Ivan.
Russian President Vladimir Putin left Sergey Ivanova on Friday as head of the presidential office.
Let's take his place, Anton Vayno.
She reported on this Russian media calling for Kremla's press release.
Putin, however, indicated that Ivanov would miss his own request.
At a meeting delivered by Russia's television station 24, the President said there was an attack on Ivanova's expectations when he went into office that he wanted to be the head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for the environment and transport.
The report on the exchange in the head of the presidential administration, which is now taking place by Ivanov's representative, Vaino, is considered to be somewhat surprising.
Ivanov, 63 years old, is still designated as one of Putin's closest employees.
This former KGB officer in the past, for example, suspended the role of the Minister of Defence and the Vice-President of the Government.
The President's Security Council will now be left behind.
When Ivanov met Putin, however, he indicated that he was a long stay in front of the administrators of the Head of State, in fact a recordman.
He's been there for four years and eight months.
In this connection, he recalled that 11 people had already been involved in this function for 25 years since its establishment.
Not even the poets of Strayc won't finally win Chafár.
Not one of the five tennis matches was yet able to change into the final part.
As his first battle, Peter Quittov lost, who was subjected to the Portuguese surprise of Monice Puigov after the sets 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while, the Czech delictists also followed Shafári to Strzyk.
The winners of Williams' sister network in the first set were after the win, however, two sets were missed and the Russians finally used the set in a short game.
The second set was lost at 4:6.
The success half-life in the afternoon program in Rio was marked by a Czech celebration: the skipper Ondréj Sonek won his semifinals with a view when the second Damira Martina from Croatia won the release almost a second.
Today's good, the conditions were great, the wind slowed down.
I've been trying to see what's best for you, sonek.
That's what his opponents had to fight for.
So they've got some power to do it, it could be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's gonna be easy. It's just playing for me.
Mirka Topinkova-Kupkova, but she didn't run into the Snowblows.
The fifteen-year-old knight has a fourth position in his chariot today, and on Saturday he is waiting for it to start at the B terminal and fight from 7 to 12.
The gold from London doesn't work like that.
I didn't go to the Olympics first.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I've had a high-quality sport and I've got everything going on.
Soupers were just better off. Topink's Button was hiding in front of them.
She struggled to the end and believed that she would get her fourth game between the elite six.
The fight was delivered until it was firmly in front of the target.
I knew that girls were meant to be able to get anyone out of that field.
I was surprised by the Chinese that she had such a fine.
And I thought I'd be able to get to the finish line through Rakušanka.
Unfortunately today is the life race, said the world's mystery since 2011.
Far behind the final defenses in Rio, the young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who was not able to sell himself out of his qualifications, this time he was a minor in bed.
In it Nepeichal has 33rd place.
Qualification was the best way for the Russians.
From the first story, Sergei Kamenski came up with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
Nepachal's gun had a value of 620.5 points.
The program in Rio was also the first to talk about the athletes, including the Czech seven-year-olds Katerín Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Cachos are part of the second Olympic competition in 11 places, Czech recordman Eliška Klučinová is twelve.
The Britka Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped up to 198 cm, is the same as the second Belgian Nafissato Thiam.
They both took care of the historic highest performance of the seven-year-old.
They tried to jump 201 inches, but they didn't.
Germany, Russia, who's worse?
In view of the absurdity of such questions, the German company has gone through a deep sebereflexia, where it does not bother anyone.
In both major Eurosian nations, dictators emerged in the 20th century and reached the power of the regimes that were Nazi, brutal and terrible.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russians contributed a great deal to 94 million victims of communism, which states the Black Book of communism, whether they were dealing with daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompatibility of war or Negede experiments.
The Nazis have frozen around 6 million Jews in a non - Indian way, and the total victims of World War II are estimated to be 60 million.
In the occupied or abandoned territories, the Germans and the Soviet Union have carried out animals.
Even in Germany, there were not only a few individuals in the SSSR, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes either actively, passively or simply by beating their heads into the sand.
It's not just the specifics of these nations, we're equally guilty.
In Germany, the end of the war came immediately, the Norimber Court.
But the most important thing was later.
As the children grew up, they began to ask themselves, ‘ Father, why did you participate in such animals? ’
How could you?
This has led to real reflection and treatment of society.
Germany’s elites have recently looked to the prosperity of the country, the eradication of poverty, the prosperity of their citizens.
Now they also have other (very often idealistic) goals, but they are definitely not going to join again Alaska-Lotrinsk or anyone - on a revanish - military attack - almost everyone will admit.
After the lost cold war in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was definitely closed at the end of the millennium when the former KGB officer (sic!)Vladimir Putin came to power.
The past is often celebrated in Russia today.
Russia's road policy is revanish, getting lost lands, reducing the West.
Health, prosperity and the future of their own people are of no value to belief.
Be afraid of yourself, and they'll be afraid of strangers.
I still believe that this is only the decades of the despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally minority - translated into the Asian (self) Tiranë.
Who is responsible for the rise in pressure around Crimea?
The Ukrainian army.
In the last days and hours there has been a deterioration of the situation at the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea area.
Who is the source of stress?
After a long period of relative rest, there was a further deterioration of relations between Ukraine and Russia.
The Ukrainian side has become part of the Krym peninsula, which has been connected more than two years ago to Russia and is part of its territory.
The reports from both opposing parties are of course contradictory and are it difficult to verify independently, so we have the possibility to just think of an old-known question that this raises?
According to a report from Moscow, there was a terrorist attack on Krym by the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine refuses and yet accuses Kremlin of provocation.
Information on the arrest of Ukrainian special units in the territory of Russia has already been received from the Savčenkovi pilot known to have been reported to have been posted on the territory of Russia.
If we were to join the Ukrainian version, what would Russia do to improve the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: nothing.
The scale of pressure around Crimea can only harm Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further tightening the sanctions and strengthening the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, there has been a crisis of immigration in Europe to take note of the situation in Ukraine.
Ukraine's leadership has already lost all credit before its citizens when President Poroschenka's current support moves around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would no longer be long-standing financial injections by the EU and primarily MMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to again pay attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation before the voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the violent factions want to be seen again as strong men who are not afraid of becoming a major Russian.
It is only hoped that all those who are trying to resolve an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their huge responsibility for the lives of the military, but all ordinary people on both opposing sides and stop their hostile actions.
Bulgaria’s first eight months of inflation
According to national statistics, 1 % of the monthly inflation rate was reached in Bulgaria in July.
This is the highest value for several years (since June 2012) and the first non-liquid value since October of the long year when an inflation rate of 0,2 % was published.
The annual average inflation measured by CPI index over the last 12 months (Srp 2015 - June 2016) compared with the previous 12 months (Srp 2014 - June 2015) was -0.8 %.
The Consumer Price Index in June 2016 was 101.0 % in June 2016 and the monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
The rate of inflation since the beginning of the year (June 2016 around December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual rate of inflation in July 2016 around July 2015 was -0.2%.
In contrast, in July 2016 there was a marked increase in the number of consumer groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
The price decreased in clothing and clothing (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and normal maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as last month, prices remained at alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
A year ago, U.S. secret services followed the hacker attacks of the Russians.
Information on Russian attacks was received to the public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that an attack was being carried out on the servers of the foreign centre of Democrats.
The Russian side of the attack is not mentioned in any official report.
Moscow was part of the attack.
The report on the monitoring of a certain Russian attack was very secret because its statement would indicate that American secret services are monitoring and detecting the way they do it and the resources they use.
Two Russian reporting services participated in the attack.
New Cybernetic Security Advisory Board
It was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Only a small group of eight heads of the Congress, called the U.S. gang of eight, were informed of public actors.
She is made up of two leading members of Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, president of the two Chambers of Nancy Pelosí and Harry Reid and four members of the Congress' defence and security committees.
The Chief of the Democratic Party, Donna brazil, announced on Thursday that it is creating a cybernetic Security Advisory Board which is "to prevent future attacks and ensure the primary protection of the Democratic Party's servers".
There was a dangerous parasite in Albert's wounded loosso.
I'm sorry.
On the basis of the consumer's concern about health after consumption of the Losos food is taken wildly - the cost of 100 g, the date of consumption 22.11.2016 were carried out on the basis of the consumer's health concerns at the sale of Albert at Václavský and At Móstka.
The control found that the L23012562/T4 tariff with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, on which the customer warned, was no longer available and therefore the product concerned was accepted with the date of consumption 11.12.2016.
The laboratory investigation confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It's a parasitic red of the trajectory of sea turtles.
This is dangerous for a person - larvae in the body environment or mussels of fish are a strong allergen and human seen livinglars can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, Štich said.
We are very sorry for the problems of this sign product.
With the above mentioned mark, we were immediately out of sales and for preventive reasons we were also standing all the other branches of this item.
The suspect came to the side of the supplier we're dealing with, and at the same time we let ourselves test this product, said the speaker, Albert Barbara Vanko.
If the customer bought this product, he can return it to any of the chain stores and get money back.
Larvy destroys ice and enough heat treatment
The seller was Nekton-Vrnīta.
They informed Prague and Central Veterinary Administration about the outbreak of dangerous hygiene products.
According to the food safety server.cz, people who view parasites may be infected with anisakisosis, which may occur with sudden chest pain, vomiting and nausea, or disease may occur without a prescription, the CHTC indicated.
The symptoms are provided for up to two weeks after consumption of less heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the start of malaria, most patients will suddenly leave their treatment.
Adults and larvae are sensitive to higher and low temperatures, so they are killed either by sufficient heat processing of fish or by freezing it.
The veterinarians have at present verified the salmon also for the recipient of the goods imported in the Central African country.
Three of the five tested samples were in the parasite.
The consignment of 1700 products came to the PRC according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) at the beginning of the autumn.
Veyexpeded, in most of the Ahold River, was today 919 packaging.
At the present time, the stockpiling of unsaled product resources from sales is taking place, said SVS speaker Petr Pejchall in fifth ČTK.
As soon as positive samples were found, the veterinarians prohibited the dispatch of other products from the warehouse.
Seventeen-year-old Brittany wanted to get rid of Racky, apparently killed her by a Russian hostage.
After initial exposure and rapid contact with the Jihadist who was attempted to kill, radiation occurred.
The expected chalifat paradise has changed for British girls into a country where there was no exception.
The girl was according to the relatives in contact with her sister Halima.
She called her back to Britain and made sure she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic state is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They have no intention of shooting, says The Telegraph of the Family Lawyer, the girl Tasnim Akunjee.
The last steps led to Rakky, where the girl called the last.
Then there's only news of her death that she can't believe.
The family communicated with her from the apartment in eastern London.
They tried together how she could get out of Rakky and cross the Turkish border.
They hoped they'd meet the former student again.
But Cadiza was probably killed before she was able to climb because the house where she was staying compared to the country to renting was introduced by the British ITV News.
TV added that the bomb was apparently caused by a Russian plane that attacked the IS forest in Syria.
You'd get the blues from the sky just to get your child out of the danger zone, Tasnim Akunjee, family lawyer.
In the week when Kadiza was thinking about fleeing from the territory of the Islamic State, one Rakushanka was arrested while trying to escape and was killed publicly.
I think that (Kadiza) has issued it as a warning and has decided not to risk it, according to BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and her 15-year-old friends from the schools of Shamim Begum and Amiro Abas were released on the 17th of the same year.
They just said they were going out.
But they were intended for Gatwick airport and from it across Turkey to the territory of the IS.
The family of girls according to the lawyer did everything they could to get Kadiz back.
You'd get the blues from the sky just to get your child out of the danger zone and this family would do everything she could to get her daughter home.
But it wasn't possible without risking their own arrest, he added a lawyer.
The only positive he considers is that the judge of Kadizy can serve as a frightening case for other girls or even boys who are allowed to break the Islamic propaganda.
"There are many cases when people went out there, realized how things were there, understood how far it was from the promises of Islamic state propaganda and wanted to come back," Aukunjee continued.
Cadiz's staff judge is not known.
However, since they are also silent, their families must be calmed by the fact that they are with the greatest likelihood of death.
To prison for money.
In Scotland, you can go for a net and without a break of crime.
For many centuries the Inveraray village was a national center and center of the Argyll River.
Since the mid - 18th century, the court has been serving as a local prison.
The conditions in which they were persecuted were sad and many prisoners tried to escape.
It's a good deal of them.
Therefore, the local representatives decided to move out of prison to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more familiar with prisons, with heating and gas lighting.
However, it was not long before it was closed for economic reasons by the end of July 1889, since the less-adjustment facility was cost-effective and was not paid too much.
The persecutions and she's a ghost.
For the public, the prison opened up a century later, visitors could compare the old building to a new building to convince themselves how different conditions prevailed in it.
The leaders in contemporary costumes still soften the authentic experience.
It is also a torture center where visitors can learn what forms of punishment they have applied to crime, whether it has already been fingerprinting or burning a mark on the body.
During visits, tourists may be allowed to close to one of the destinations, most of them because of the photo on the memory, or to express their feelings of being in prison over the networks.
However, the Inveraray prison is one of the most famous Scottish premises in which he is likely to be scared.
Several groups of paranormal activity have already appeared there, and today the museum allows people to come into contact with some spirits.
That night goes for 300 pounds, which is approximately 9500 kroner.
In addition to this popular tourist attractions, there are also great food, contemporary panorama and history.
"Animé" effect on Snapchat is criticised as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by animation, but some observers say it's racially unfeeling.
The Snapchat application allows about 150 million users each day to change the reality and play with the same methods that limit them to absurdity.
You can make ananas, a dog or a building that looks like it comes out of Roy Lichtenstein's picture.
The filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved self-sustainers every day.
Any mistake will be published immediately.
The Snapchat filters in the past have served as criticism of the accusation that the application promotes blackfacing or that it supports white cuts of skin as an ideal beauty.
So when this week the users offered a filter, thanks to which they had soft eyes, covered teeth and focused faces, some critics marked it as the racist character of the Asians - "Yellowface."
And they wondered if these repeated controversial issues did not indicate a greater problem in society - a problem with diversity.
In the middle of that, Verge and Motherboard wrote and the news and the explosion spread rapidly and Snapchat immediately announced the next day that the function had been cancelled.
The company offered an explanation: Filter was designed as an account display I set up anonymity, not as an Asian cartoon.
But to observers who were witnesses to racism, the filter reminded them of painful stereotypes in action.
The rest of them refused to be compared with the animation.
Grace Sparapani, a student of American art from Korea whose photo tweet was widely shared, stated by e-mail that the filter was "at least harmful and tragic."
He added that “it is difficult to argue against the comparison of the obvious Asian character and filter effects.
It is shown that the filter is not only about yellow face (yellowface), but that yellow face is attached to the upper extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
It seems that America's culture has an endless array of divergence and inclusion, from the blues in the company after Hollywood and the equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And the vast number of young people in Snapchat - who are more racially diverse than their older partners - can mean that they can expect even greater sensitivity.
"When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to some user," said 15-year-old Katie Zhuová in the interview on Thursday, "but it's very hard to cover these things today without notice, as it was before."
Katie Zhuo, the product manager and proposer who works for the Media, decided on Thursday to reduce her account on Snapchat and invited others to do the same.
In an article for the Media and the telephone discussion, it is convinced that racially motivated problems reflect a lack of diversity at the meetings of employees in Snapchat.
Katie Zhuová criticised the transporting whites, the entire male management company and the article ended hash tag: #DelateSnapchat.
"It's either that there's no difference between employees and color people at the moment they decide about these things," Zhuova, who has Chinese-American origin, said, "or people working there, but not on positions to feel safe or pleasant to talk about."
Other observers share her opinion - the difficulty Snapchat left in a significant way without a reply.
The company does not publish the figures relating to the diversity of its employees by its status as private companies.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of his employees, but according to the speaking company, he recently adopted a collective worker who should focus on the insufficiently represented population and on internal management.
Zhuova adds: “I’m aware that other users really need to be able to say that it’s not okay” by keeping their account broken.
Military officials have highlighted the reporting information on IS, says the Parliamentary Committee
The Parliamentary Committee stated in its report on Thursday that the officials of the central government of the United States changed the reports of the reporting services to express more optimistic pictures of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than they had done in Syria.
According to the previous reports of the Working Group set up by the President of the Committee on Armed Forces, the Committee on Reporting Services and the Committee on Defence, there was a "extreme uncertainty" between the analyses of the Central Reporting Service, which their administrations changed their assessment of the American effort to defeat the Islamic State.
The Central Authority, known as CentCom, is an army centre in Tampe on Florida, which is responsible for American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release states: “The performances of the reporting secret services approved by the senior officials of Centcoma have usually offered a more positive picture of the U.S. counter-terrorism forces than have been confirmed by the facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than the analyses received from other parts of the reporting community.”
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are injured when an incorrect analysis is submitted by policy makers," said Ken Calvert, a congressman and a Republican from California.
Walking in the direction of the Centcco is up to the top of the organization.
The 10-year-old report describes in detail the persistent problems of the central stage in the description and analysis of American forces in the training of Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although there is no conclusive evidence that the senior representatives of the Obama administration ordered that the reports be changed, it is stated in the report that analysts had the opinion that they were under pressure by the Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the danger posed by the Islamic State or IS.
“In the first half of 2015, there were a number of medium-term press reports, statements and statements from the Congress which were much more positive than what actually happened,” says the report.
For example, the representative of the Centccom publicly announced that a major military attack on the Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is quite clear after months of investigation," said Ambassador Mike Pompeo, representative of the Republican Party from Kansas.
From the mid-2014 to the mid-2015, the highest level of staff in the United States Central State reporting service has been manipulating the risk of the IS in Iraq from mid-2014 to mid-2015.
The Republicans formed a working group after learning about the concerns of analysts about the handling of information from the reporting services concerning the Islamic State.
After the report published in the fourth quarter, more detailed examinations must be followed after further examination.
In the Centco reporting services, further investigations are carried out by the Ministry of Defence's general inspectorate.
The members of the Democratic Committee on Reporting Services published their own findings on Thursday, which were in line with some of the conclusions of the working group of the Republicans.
"Centcom has developed a very close process for the establishment of an evaluation of information on IS and Iraq's security components between 2014 and 2015," said representative Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and representatives of the Democrats.
According to Adam Schiffa, this process "has led to overhauling the outputs of reporting services," he has damaged morale between analysts and "insufficiently taken into account non-conformity."
However, Schiff and Democrats claim that they have found no evidence that the White House would try to pressure the Centco analysts to make their conclusions according to the "pretty or political situation."
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in the afternoon in Daily Beach.
In July, Loni New York Times reported on the ongoing investigation of General Inspector-General Pentagon, which was initiated after the difficulties of Centcom's analysts.
Commander-in-Chief Patrick Evans, speaker of the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the parliamentary report because the investigation of the Inspector General is still continuing.
He noted, however, that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data and that the reporting community and the defence ministry welcome a healthy dialogue on these basic issues of national security."
The investigation has an impact on the framework of the question whether the United States is successful in the bombing in Iraq and Syria (a product which now announces the growing number of defence representatives).
However, the London prosecution raised questions as to how far President Obama can rely on the central stage of the fair assessment of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis sites.
The criticism of the report on the Islamic state reflects the conflict more than ten years ago, when analytic of the report services of the Centcomo Gregory Hooker wrote a research work in which it was stated that President George W. Bushe - despite the intentions of many analysts - called on a small unit in Iraq and gave only a little time to think about what will follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in the defense of the Islamic State's intelligence services.
Last year the authorities announced that the Hooker team concluded that despite a public statement on the return, air attacks against the refinery of the Islamic state were not as highly financial sources of this terrorist group as the group was building temporary refinery and the thief was selling on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the investigation was not carried out outside the central stage.
Director of Centcom, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then given a detailed criticism of the year after many legislators were looking for the witness of the Senate to be too positive for the war.
General Austin stood in the dub and rewarded her in the centc. Joseph L. Votel.
The United States won in the earthly hockey in the fourth game in order, so today it will be playing the decisive game in the Great Britain team.
Katie Bam, in the game against Japan, who ended up winning at 6:1, shot three branches and only the day after the American women's hockey team shot the first two branches of the game in which America won India 3:0 on Thursday.
Five defenses in two matches were successful, but Bamwa (27) said she wasn't sure if something like that ever happened to her.
"I have no idea," she said.
I don't belong to those who record their own branches.
But he knows this: The Americans on the Olympic tournaments take on 4:0 and it's about the first place in the group with Great Britain that stayed on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0.
The United Kingdom and the United States will be on Saturday in the last game of the first car.
Both teams qualified to the fourth final and the game will decide who of the six teams will end in the first and the second.
The first group avoids the strong Danes who are on the head of the second group.
Whatever the Saturday event ends, the Americans here called out their surprise ride, four years after they ended between 12 teams at London's games.
There was Bam in that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and hockey on the ground hockey first took her hand when she was 3 years old (her older sister played double in Drexel) and entered the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player at the same time.
The Olympics won her in 2008 because she didn't get to the final directory.
Then came in 2012, when she didn't get too much done to her or her team members.
The next year he was a coach named English Craig Parnham and things began to change.
"Culture change, mental change, physical change," said Bamva.
In London we didn't have as much working time as we do today.
We've done a whole business.
On Thursday night, Bamva started the first half of the shooting of the nearby branch.
India entered the game without victory in the tournament, but the team appeared to be surprisingly firm and kept score 1:0 until the end of the third quarter when Bamva took advantage of the opportunity.
The only one on the left side of the playing field, then she jumped into the middle and shot the ball into the bank to get the Americans to drive 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last branch in half a quarter.
The U.S. branch office, Jackie Briggs, which in each of the three victories helped one branch, was actually the first in the tournament.
He's in great shape.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good place now," said Parnham, but as good as it is, this will depend on the outcome of the Saturday game.
Green trampoline in the middle of the Olympic Spring
It's one, where you are, it's one, how long it's been - it's an Olympic.
From the event in Rio de Janeiro it is to feel sustainable, irresistibly and busy in terms of competitiveness and effort.
It's like the Olympic origin itself is a Jewish statuette that is handed over by a sailor, a gymnast and a triatlonist.
You can't stop television, read the news or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the front of the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Billes, Katie Ledecy or the indiscriminateness between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a lovely woman with flowers in her face, is at the Olympic first and could also be among those whose names appear in households in the main sending time between advertising and sponsors if he was blue, yellow or even black.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest in California is fighting about Olympic gold in trampoline jumps.
The Olympic Fire doesn't shine on all the competitions alike.
From the middle, there are some sports that are not generally recognized: shooting from air guns, shootings, badminton, so on.
We'll always be successful in a classic blue-style, and it'll probably last a long time.
But if I can call my extraordinary favorite, let me warn you about the inconsistencies of trampoline.
Although jumps to the Olympic sports trampoline since 2000, when they were first introduced to the games in Sydney, this sport remains almost unremarkable after 16 years - many people I asked or didn't even know it was Olympic sport.
It could be regional intolerance.
The US never won medals on the trampoline jumps and by 2012 none of the athletes got to the finish.
Prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year the gold medals from London will show Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLeanna from Canada.
The jumps on the trampoline, however, have another reason, partly because the unencumbered ear will seem to be more like a clone university than an Olympic.
I have to admit I'm not an expert, but I'm just a superhero from the country.
It has a comical potential - comical vibration of endless reflection - but also the quality of gymnasiums and gymnasiums, two sports that combines in itself.
The word ‘trampoline’ is derived from the Spanish ‘el trampoline’, meaning ‘scokan table’.
The spiraling champions jump on a large trampoline that shoots them up to about 10 meters and predominates several elements (salt, roots and combinations) before they finally reach their feet again.
According to the official Olympic Programme, they are assessed according to implementation, difficulties and "airtime".
In Rio it will compete with twelve athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The regular Olympic road trajectory is ahead.
The gold medal fighters must go on, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, elsewhere and back up, up and down.
It tries to match not only the target flag or the starting wall, but also the television reporting, as well as another positive line: the world or the Olympic record.
This one-sided effort is noble, wonderful, a little fantastic - and enough to bring miracles to tears.
But I think it's just kind of frustrating when you're following the Olympics.
Jumps on the trampoline in this regard bring the catch.
The route of the athlete on the trampoline is towards the top.
I don't mean to move forward.
He or she looks like they're in a state of no longer being like an astronaut, flying up, then down, and then again without a lift up.
Without competition and, of course, no difficulties, but after the duration of the system, there will be no urgent fight to achieve the goal, no remote measurement, but only perfect, smoothing time and gravity.
This is only the closest when the Olympics and the Sun are approaching.
Qualifications and final women are held on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock in the east time, then on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will finally be sent within the afternoon block starting in two days within 14 hours.
In the midst of Olympic madness, they promise the calm, pleasant times that you will probably see through the other files.
And if it's only to be careful that men athletes will be the subject of favorite views and excitement - as Wall Street Journal has recently proposed U.S. high school students - then Logan Dooley's only waiting for his new fans who dig for the roof.
"Protestant Generation" in Ethiopia, long-standing United States
Rape Protests in Ethiopia
Democrats calling for political changes in Ethiopia were attacked by the government's violent opposition.
The Witnesses claim that many protesters were shot during police raids.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
In recent decades it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, the country has been experiencing anti-government tensions that continue to expand to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have gone to the streets requiring major political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response was cruel.
The witnesses claim that the police have shot and killed the representatives of unarmed protesters.
In colloquial videotapes from protests that are likely to come from the end of last year or beginning this year, the security forces are captured, like young Hole people after being forced to stand on the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and to take action before it is even more difficult," Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
The American military and reporting services are working with Ethiopia to eliminate the risk of a terrorist attack in the area, particularly in Somalia, and a minority from African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has developed at a gradual pace.
Her infrastructure has improved in a major way - in the main city of Addis Ababa even a new local train.
And the streets of cities are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Ethiopia can hardly be seen as a model of democracy - an organization fighting for human rights without talking about government repression - opposition in the country has been provoked, dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many of them were told, imprisoned, killed, or expelled from the wilderness.
But it can change.
"When people die and they don't have any other chance to protest, they're going to fall," said Seyoum Teshome, who is presenting to the University in central Ethiopia.
He's protesting every young man.
He's protesting the entire generation.
The difficulties are many and relate to all of the disputes about the ground after absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
Following the London elections which were widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies obtained the last cross of opposition and now controls 100 per cent in Parliament.
At the same time, the pressure on the border with Eritrea grew. The conflict divided this unexplained, controversial border demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Anilitics fear that the separatist groups that have been involved during the past few years, such as the Russian Liberation Front or the Uganda National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the treasure and rebuild it again.
There are several factors that explain why these hot feelings have been re-examined after years of submerged.
The first one is probably harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks up to the last few years when they have become more easily accessible telephones and have improved the provision of Internet services.
And even if the government prohibits access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually done during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxys that hide the status of these people.
Several Ethiopian youths spoke about how they were meeting in protest.
There is still more solidarity between Oromy and Amhary, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amhars are not natural allies.
After many years of Amhar, especially from the Christian peaks of Ethiopia, resulted in politics and trade and the use of Oroms, many of which are Muslims and live in lowlands.
But it's also changing.
"We are on our way to united leadership," said Mulat Gemechu, the leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests came in the areas of Amhary and Oromy.
Many Amhars and Oromos believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by the members of the Tigris ethnicity, which makes up around 6% of the population and controls the army, the judiciary, the trade and politics.
The third reason for the disturbances is Melese Zenawi's death.
Genai, former leader of the rebels, was the Ethiopian Prime Minister of Government for all 17 years until his death in 2012, when he suffered an unreported defeat.
He was considered to be a tactical genius, a man who could see behind his back.
Analysts say that in particular he was able to dismiss the original signs of discomfort and use the senders to process and gain on his side.
"The current regime deals with basic knowledge," said Abdi, analytic of the conflict.
The new President of the Government of Ethiopia, Hailemaria Desalegn, was expelled from relative ignorance with a view to replacing Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who comes from the Tigris region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemaria comes from the south.
Analysts claim he has no confidence in the security services of the Tigris.
Many fear that the result will result in further bleeding.
Ethiopia has recently experienced such anxiety in 2005 after thousands of people have protested about what analysts have identified as the elections that the government has collected and then stole.
He followed a strong principle during which there was a lot of protesting killings - even though less than in recent months - and this period of restlessness has passed relatively quickly.
The development experts assessed Ethiopia's leaders for visional infrastructure planning, which is a new local train and a measurable step in the fight against poverty.
It is quite obvious, however, that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government has not stopped.
And it comes to dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month protesting in the Amhar City of Gondar attacked businesses owned by Tigers and attacks against the Tigers on social networks were increasingly common.
Analysts say that protests will lead to an unacceptable situation in the United States and another western link.
The US government uses Ethiopia as a basis for drone crossings over neighboring Somalia, even though it has recently declared that it has been closed.
While the West wants to support democracy in a single way, at the same time he does not want its link to such an uninterrupted area to disappear.
'That's it,' said Abdi, 'is very hard food.'
Donald Trump explains his work on Obama and IS funding as "sarcasmus"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to back up the latest controversy that was under way in his campaign by stating that he did not think so seriously when several times this week he insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the terrorist groups of the Islamic state.
The explanation raised new issues regarding the ability of a Republican candidate to speak clearly to the President with the US public.
He also finds himself in an unpleasant situation with his standing in the midst of a violent storm and has to explain that his comments may not have really been taken seriously.
After this proposal for a meeting in the middle of the night, Trump confirmed the production on Thursday and held talks that he was not really meant to say that the President and Mr Clinton’s IS were created.
In his Twitter contribution on Friday morning, Trump announced that he was just sarcastic.
The contribution was in contrast to the claim of an old man only one day when Trump said in a few discussions that his accusations were serious.
When Conservative Voting Moder Hugh Hewitt tried to help theump note to indicate that Obama was trying to destroy the IS, the candidate for the Republicans did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes at a time when Trump tried to focus his campaign on the economy, while his preference in the pre-trial studies was reduced.
Trump and Clinton took part this week in Michigan duel on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to this subject.
On Twitter he once again warned that Clinton's proposals were linked to an increase in taxation and indicated that her speech was boring.
The trumpet has already been used by the defense of the sarcissus.
At the end of July, when he closed down his criticism when he came up with a proposal that the Russians should search out Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his comment: "I am, of course, sarcastic."
This approach allows Trump to press the limits of political declarations and to measure them as necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing to what extent some reports of response to his supporters to find out how they respond and then, according to the reaction, "he gave an explanation," said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who followed the language used by both candidates.
But I also think that in my statements, they're rather foolish and he knows that they're important enough to be able to explain different things.
As the results of the preliminary research in its progress continue to decline, Trump in the last days allowed even more alarming tone, instead of measuring things for the general voters.
A new study of the NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump is with great distance for Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close to it in Florida.
Theump is actually trying to avoid apologizing for what he says, but often his criticisms are due to the wrong interpretation of his words or lack of understanding of his sense of humor.
But together with the fact that in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's comments have led to his unhappy situation, which must be publicized, even if his remarks are already provocative.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, one of the most prominent of the troops, had to call on the candidate on Thursday in his CNN speech.
"I think what he says is the right political comment," Giuliani said when he was asked about the probability of the trumpet claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama IS was almost unknown, a small organization that was called a novelty, and it came because its army from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans are trying to argue that Obama’s government, in which Clinton acted as a foreign minister, has allowed IS to go ahead and unable to manage the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before the fifth assembly in Pennsylvania Trump continued on Twitter, fires were lit around the media because they had changed every word and were arrested against him.
He spoke to "poor, pathetic" TV students who try to understand her, and he said, "That's impossible!"
Several Democrats have apologized to Trump that it is only another proof that the presidential authority is not capable of doing so.
The coffee shop was removed from the price market. It's now returning to Greenpoint
The Verb Café was a hot spot in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee was given for 15 years.
Naturally, she was kicked from the front of the house at Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - the store that Verb won in 2014 - sells furniture in the form of dormitories.
The locals cried it as the last loss of the growing city.
The artist Molly Crabaple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is exhausted and from Verb is now out of business."
But if New York changes, then it's also a reconnaissance.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened the London in November in Greenpoint, less than miles north of the original site.
The new Verb has Wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees work there and enjoy a similar, modest atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the original coffee shop, which is also the owner and executive director of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of his clients offered to pay for the move to a new location, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left many things as they were.
Verb still has the same supply of incense and bought the same model of machinery on espresso.
He even used the light from the old verb again.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new.
He started using the new covenant.
The offer includes sandwiches with honey, egg and cheese and toppings, such as cassava and dried apples.
You'll find a mix of raisins here too.
The coffee shop doesn't give you beer anymore, but it'll offer you pure fruit juice.
Nine months later Rodriguez noticed the constant presence of original stamgasts.
"A number of original customers also had to move from Williamsburg because of prices," he said.
Last week there was one of those clients, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs. Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg and often went to Verb Caffe.
She came even after the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verba," she said.
Now he drinks coffee again, but on that day he gave his usual ice coffee a mixed tea, another newspaper.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-term customer, has been going to Verba since 2003.
He's going to work and he's always ordering himself.
"On Thursday and eight here every day, like hours, I'll come and prepare my house for me with all my mind and mind," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add a new invitation.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he used to do, but sometimes he lets himself be given on his own house to all the elephants, eggs and honey.
Rodriguez said he's not sorry that the model trade took his old place.
It is true that Soap Cherie's owners offered him a special model for Verb and as an oath they use filtered coffee from the coffee shop.
"I think we could still use it," said Rodriguez.
The traditional pools of Greenpoint also welcomed the coffee shop.
One of the new customers transferred the offer to the post office and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon show up to make his new neighbors feel at home.
The new place has other benefits.
The local producer of fruit juices wants to get into the bottle and sell filtered coffee.
It offers an opportunity to expand the coffee shop into a nearby building.
Many customers are enough to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee was closed, his heart was broken.
Mr. Whitt says that when the coffee shop opens again, buying and giving up coffee is like coming home.
"I've missed that ring," he said.
Depressive food since the crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after his arrival at the president's office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in Oválné working and eating.
President Roosevelt welcomed the chosen five-avenue dishes, such as a pasta from the wild potatoes and maryland grass.
His menu on this day, however, was more modest: the egg in the Devil’s way in the garden of Eden, the brown pepper and as a dessert of light powder.
"It was an act of cook solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
A couple who live in Brooklyn Heights is engaged in gastronomic history.
The last book of Andrew Coea "Chop Suey" was about the Chinese kitchen in America, while Jane in her book "97 Orchard" tells the life story of the house living on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work "A Square Meal", which is in the public Harper's afternoon, is the stories of the American kitchen during the great economic crisis.
They showed their own cook solidarity, and they met with the reporter at dinner in Eisenberg's trade with sandwiches, a small-scale buffet in the fourth Flatiron, which has been in operation since the crisis since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered the silver cheese and sandwiches with dried olives, Andrew (57) gave the crocans, brown cassava, and mechanized green.
The rapporteur ordered a mass carbanate, which, according to the couple, was very good at talking about food during the crisis.
"The caravans were very popular," said Ms. Ziegelman.
He's sold a burrow, liver and phase carbanade.
They were made from those bees and other cheap foods that the ingredients have continued to produce.
Imagine the number of beers you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe's stuck.
"They would lie in your stomach like a wolf," he said.
In the years leading up to the crisis, the American kitchen, especially in foreign areas, was provided with a form of snow buffet that you eat.
The women's teams burned for farm workers, and for breakfast, dinner and dinner they offered clean baked bread.
They were Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the first world war. "And Square Meal" follows the ways in which the nation was equal to the fact that it was not a host country at all.
"It was the time when food became an average, scared point for American people," Coe said to an explanation why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Similarly, a new budget diet was feared: it expanded the tasteful food, such as carbanades and cassole foods, casseroles as "a wonderful way to use the rest," said Ziegelman, because the cooks could hide nonaesthetic ingredients under the type of cream sauce.
The pure fruit was replaced by the cheapest dried fruit.
Masso - after a long year the average American food item - became a controversial luxury.
Special mixtures that were to serve as caloric and life-threatening were given priority before feeling or even having a healthy sense of cooking.
During the research for a book containing recipes, Ms. Ziegelman has prepared a meal of dried cereals filled with butter butter.
"It wasn't a favorite increase on the dinner table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman stressed: "It was surrealistic."
The Bura's butter with a cooked apple doesn't come together.
It was typical for a lot of home recipes.
As never before and never after, domestic economies - among them Louise Stanley, the largest federal economic authority in the years 1923 to 1943 - led the country’s scary practices.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, called on women to take the heavy budget, and the skiers, like mastic spaghetti from the bush, changed to delicious foods.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical events.
In particular, the tests were carried out in response to the government's hungry citizens, such as perhaps late President Herbert Hoover's "I'll have a cake".
While publicly praising the simple egg farm kitchen of his childhood, he considered himself the chosen millionaire who became.
"He likes to eat continental cuisine like fish with a chicken sauce," Andrew Coe said.
He ate in almost adjoining rooms, he had a smoking on him.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistakes if his wife Eleanor didn't accept to go along with her own complaint.
As the book reports, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a gentleman who was not interested in the taste, which led to the White House "not only giving the most expensive food in all of Washington, but also the most enjoyable way prepared."
A number of food habits from the time of the crisis have declined as soon as the country is back on its feet.
The link remained in our continuous calorie and survival test, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science applies to smoking.
Some say that during writing books they better understood the scary habits of Miss Ziegelman's mother - perhaps why she couldn't eat.
"She had a real fear of food poisoning," Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman said, "The people were wrong."
There's been an accident with the twins.
When there were clean chairs in Eisenberg, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert that they prepared at home: the candlelight dessert that President Roosevelt ate for dinner.
"It's called a Christmas cream," Ziegelman said and added that the usual trick was to give modest recipes for elegant names.
There was no cream there, only candles, some butter, sugar, water and sugar.
Every one of us accidentally put a lie into a rough stomach.
That was so bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
As a proper lord, he said to his wife, "It would have been a bit darker."
Europeans: The migrants are going to do it.
Most refugees entering Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians are making fun of themselves.
That's how the series would look if we hit them.
A group of Russian artists, called 2D Among Us, are playing from their home country.
With the help of the photoshop, they create colleges that show funny how it would look if the famous series and films appeared in Russia.
Gilead pays the cost of legal representation in the case of a patent against type C fraud against Merck
The District Court decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to pay fees for lawyers who have caused it in the case of patent against type C fraud against the manufacturer of Merck & Co Inc medicines.
In June, the judgment was dropped that Gilead had to pay 200 million for damage caused by the breach of two Merck patents in connection with the very successful medicines of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the Federal Court had repeatedly found illegal treatment on the part of Merck, except under the oath and other non-ethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman wrote on Thursday that Gilead has a fine for the reduction of fees that have occurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to find Gilead, which dominates the new generation of medicines market against type C glioutant, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case comes in 2013, when both Gilead and Merck complained to each other and claimed they were the owner of the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of medicines from Gilead.
United States military units claim to have gained full control over Manbijz
The US-supported military units gained full control over the northern city of Manbijz shortly after the last Islamic state fighters jumped out of the city, the group spoke on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now covering the city after the rest of the radicals that have been hiding in the city.
The units released over 2,000 civilians who were radically detained, told Reuters Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manbage Military Council.
"The city is now under our control, but we are still looking for it," said the Reuters agency.
Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid the federal tax rate 34.2 per cent
Hillary Clinton published its tax recognition on Friday, 2015, stating that the presidential candidate for democracy and her husband had incomes of $10.75 million this year and paid a real tax of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, the Clintons awarded $1 million to the charter, mainly to the Clinton Foundation. President Bill Clinton contributed almost $5.3 million to the joint cash fund, and the former foreign minister granted $3 million from Simon & Schuster's charge for his book on his influence on the foreign ministry.
Clinton's colleague, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, with his wife Anne Holton, issued tax recognition for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are still an example of financial transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped with the campaign.
On the contrary, Donald Trump is hiding behind false statements and withdraws from his previous promises that his tax recognition is public.
It is common for US President-in-Office candidates to publicize their tax recognition, even if they are not governed by the law.
Trump, a businessman from New York, and his lawyers quoted the audit of the U.S. Finance Board as reason for his refusal to publish the tax authorisation.
"Your move," said the side campaigner Hillary Clinton on Twitter and pointed to the tax recognition of democratic candidates.
Michael Cohen, Special Councillor of Trump, said on Thursday CNN that it would not allow Trump's tax recognition to be published until the audits were completed.
According to Trump’s criticisms, among which the Republican candidate is president of 2012 Mitt Romney and other members of the Republic, it is agreed that his refusal raises questions regarding his net profit, contributions to the Charter, trade transactions and various other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton's question is very strong, and on Friday she published a video that reminds him of how high public figures in the Trump are urging him to publish his tax recognition.
On Thursday, the question will change its appearance on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all other candidates did to the Presidential Office after the decade - to publish his tax recognition," she said to the people.
The Policy Organisation stated that the Trump paid no or very low tax in the last two years of the 1990s and that the New York Times quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants who claim that this can be done at present.
Federal tax rates have become the subject of presidential elections.
Clinton is implementing a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett, which would ensure that all who make more than $1 million a year pay taxes at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week Buffet at Clinton's meeting in Omaz, in Nebraska, where Buffet's Conglomerate Berkshire Hataway is staying, selected the Trump to meet and exchange tax recognition.
Buffett said he also had an IRS audition and that Trump was "not afraid" of the financial authority, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign published the tax recognition back to 2007.
Clinton, who now lives in Chappaqua, New York, paid federal tax on average by 32 per cent and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 per cent between 2007 and 2014.
From the recognition of Clinton’s tax for 2015, it appears that, unlike most Americans, they only earn $100.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund from which Clinton received dividends and rates of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chili or fire extinguishers for the protection of elephants in Tanzania
The conservationists of nature in Tanzania use a non-orthodox method to prevent elephants from moving into human habitats - houses on them condoms filled with chili dust.
This process has been witnessed and promoted by Honeyguide, who, with the idea that a few years ago, together with the American organic organisation The Nature Conservancy, promotes and teaches volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, how to protect their homes and their habitats in four steps without harming animals.
Many of them used copies in their defense before.
Friday is the world's day of elephants that is responsible for protecting these animals.
"Since the time this ... tool file has been developed, we have noted a change in behavior in these communities. People believe much more that it is possible for elephants to maintain their fields without harming them," said the executive director of the Honeyguide Damian Bell in a statement.
The first step and the second step is on the passing elephant to greet the battery and release the crakson.
If she doesn't do this, she'll get rid of what's called "chilli cloud".
Chilli smiles with a petardo to the condom, his end is so he's surprised that he's only biting his nose.
After the fire the condom will be blown up and the air will be blown away by a wet dust from the chili.
Most of the time, there's one game, and the elephant is coming out of another direction.
The last option is to fire a fire engine that produces a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director turned to the Berlin hotel because he removed the code for calling to Israel to "request" Arabs - RT News
The French film director of the Jewish origin called for a divorce in the media after he found out that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have such a code for calling to Israel, according to the employer's "claim" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the documentary about the Holocaust Shoah, vented his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel code list.
However, the state has not been established between countries where it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, Germany’s main city, Israel was removed and destroyed?
It's Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers an opportunity to call to Israel via its own call centre.
The director was looking for an explanation and turned to the hotel reception problem.
The answer he received, Lanzmann, according to his word, was "shocked".
The hotel worker replied that the measure "was decided upon following the assessment of the management of the company Kempinski Hotels."
The reason for this step was more popular by the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they asked you to remove Israel's call code," Lanzmann quoted an employee in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's prime minister in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman identified the case as a "great shame".
We were scared and shocked by the events.
It's just about yourself. It's a huge shame.
The fact that something like this has happened in Germany and in addition to such a hotel network is even bigger.
No further explanation is required.
We expect the hotel to produce the right conclusions," he said.
The event caused a strong reaction online, people marked it as scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski hotel just "lost" in demanding Arab customers.
"Hanba for you," says another contribution, indicating that the hotel located in the noble street of Kurfurstendam is located near the synagogue.
According to the Diary Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly gave up any charge that the event marked "visit" and Lanzman "talked".
"No direct order has ever been issued" without including Israel in the list of codes for calling, Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes the representative of the hotel Kempinski.
It adds that the call code has been added to the list.
The police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against protesting Brazilian students
The students and the police arrived in San Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday, when the students met for demonstrations against government reforms in the public education system.
The anti-constitutional police used low-power and rubber projectiles.
The problem was solved when the government order services tried to separate the students, which ended when the police used rubber and solar gas.
The demonstration was attended by several hundred students with a view to expressing their concerns about the plans.
Among the government's proposals in San Paulo Gerald Alckmina to save money is the closure of nearly a hundred public schools and the transfer of 300,000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were able to see how they accepted letters against temporary President Michel Temer.
The latest protest will only come a few days after the demonstrators appeared together in the streets to support the meeting of President Dilmy Rousseff when the Senate decided on her complaint.
Trade between Russia and Iran grew by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian Embassy in Iran, Lebanon Dzhagaryana grew by 70.9 per cent after the abolition of the sanctions between Moscow and Tehran in the mid-term comparison.
As the Ambassador pointed out, since the time the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, interest has increased by Russian companies operating in the country.
Russian companies renew existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is of course one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016 trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent in comparison with the same period for 2015 and reached an increase of US$ 856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran rose by 91.5 per cent and reached up to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent by $158 million.
A huge increase in trade has provided supplies of equipment, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Zhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
In recent years the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran has issued some 35,000 visas, mostly travel.
Iran also first reached between top 20 countries by the number of tourists coming to Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia will be won from a long year," he said.
At the same time, however, Iran visits relatively small Russians. The Ambassador hopes that there will be a change.
"I personally can recommend a visit to the city of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the memories of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition," he said.
Scott Callum Skinner runs home after the British got gold in the cycle
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered last night into his son's glory at a male team on the radio station in Rio when three VB teams began titled London 2012.
Thirty-five-year-old family from Glasgow was in the role of a hero who took over his Scott Sir Chris Hoy, and a young legend rejoiced when he reached his goal and stole the victory with the hand of a favorite New Zealand.
Britain won a surprise four years ago and Hoy won a fifth of her six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick returned after the end of the humble sixth world championship in the street cycle in March, even though Hoy finished his career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the award for Specialized Initiator Jamie Staff.
So, Hindus appeared just in time.
After Hoye left, the place was also set free, which tried to fill up Kian Emmadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindis - who was with Hoy's champion four years ago - and Skinner got an Olympic record at his qualification, but the trick took him to New Zealand's first round.
And the British trio got gold in the team.
Hindes was behind his wheel, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change of the strategy was a major part of the transformation when Hindus took on a higher translation to slow down and enable Kenny and Skinner in part to keep the pace.
Hoy was watching from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindi appeared on the stage, he didn't let their eyes down.
Thirty-five-year-old Skinner, a father from Glasgow, said, "It's a slight comparison."
I'm here to get the best of myself and honor my name.
We created an Olympic record in the finals and we defeated the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After the triumph by Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindus admitted that he had fallen on the road voluntarily after a weak start.
The signal came back later, and Britain's opponents had no chance to withdraw.
This time there was no such problem about this victory.
Hindus said, "With all those British trains at the courts, I seemed like London."
In the last three months, we've all been together as a team.
We've won many world races, so it's just amazing to win the Olympic again.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be a step-by-step in the last five months, then we'll have five days on the video.
With the form that Kenny provided, it is not unlikely that he would have succeeded Hoy's success and won one Olympic with three gold medals at the same time.
This would then be for Kenny - which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, also has its birth on March 23rd (this date seems to be sacred for British sports, this day also celebrated births by Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meant a total of six gold medals and one silver medal.
Just how much Hoy got.
As with the next one, Kenny's going to take part in a show that starts today and takes another three days.
Eighty - year - old Bolton said: “I don’t enjoy myself here.
Team race is always the best.
You're playing with others.
To tell the truth, to win for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindus said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a ritere title."
It was the only medal competition that day, but the British were waiting for another good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Dowell qualified as the fastest in the four-mile race of companies.
It's 3:51,943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and the finals (2:42) are completed on today's second day of the race on which Wiggins will focus.
Yesterday before the qualifying competition, he discussed with the Commissioner when its decision-makers called for a measure of excellence.
In a similar race of women who continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trotts, Joanna Rowsell Shandov, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavia arrived at the world record with time 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on its strong road Cyclists team and ruled the middle period of the Olympic Games and obtained a lot of medals.
After really outstanding performances showing easy movement in Beijing and London, Rio’s expectations were reduced during the preparation.
In the background, dramatic events took place, in the final series of the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in deep for the charge of sex and discrimination, and the end of the career of the great ones, such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as it shows on the first night of the competition on the video, it seems that the legendary reputation that the Great Britain team can perform a great exercise with perfect timing so that it can be confirmed again.
The future of ports in Portland after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland port port port terminal in Victoria - and the workplaces of workers - is uncertain because of electricity that the company is supplying electricity and that it has informed one of the owners of an electricity supply contract. It is expected that all electricity supply contracts will be terminated.
This step follows what the government of Victoria decided earlier this year that it does not sell the supply of the supply that the company holds.
The validity of a fixed 20-year grant shall be extended in November.
Alcoa Portland may be at risk of up to 2000 jobs.
The closure may threaten up to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect.
And because the yard consumes about 10 percent of total electricity in Victoria, it can lead to other destructive effects.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the bridge to Point Henry, which led to the closure of England’s electricity.
Alcoa's company's tavirina in Portland is spreading and threatening to close it.
This step follows several years of speculation regarding the future of the company, originally in response to a strong Australian dollar and in recent times due to prices for the production of the race.
AGL, which provides electricity from Loy Yang A electricity to the Latrobe Valley Valley, announced that it is expected that one of the three other owners will also decide to terminate the contract.
Most of the company's owners are Alcoa and Aluminum's company, small business shares are owned by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubien Corp.
"AGL expects the Portland race to continue to function, in other words, so that the demand for electricity from the port will continue," she said.
AGL stated that the contracts are so-called ‘insurance contracts’ that they should enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so their validity will indeed end in 2017.
"AGL further assumes that the contracts will be shared for the financial year 2017," the electrician announced.
Any possible impact on AGL’s gains since the fiscal year 2018 is still limited by the strong market view of the comedian market for wholesale electricity.
AGL stated that it had already signed the contract value according to its accounting books of $187 million "if it were to end."
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract "has no effect on its ... ability to operate or to secure supplies of electricity to the factory."
The US company stated that in 2010 it had concluded a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years which had to start paying since November of this year, even though it still had to explain why it had entered into the contract.
Analysts are very careful when it comes to the possible closure of the port port port in Victoria and the Tomago race near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
Director of the AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megatons of electricity per year and around 900 megagatons of Tomago.
If both of these companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in market demand [electric energy].
It wouldn't be good for us as manufacturers," he said.
Kendall is not just a star real TV show Cardassianov - now it's the observatory of the Spring Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), model and fourth mother-manager of the Kristis Kardashian-Jenner clan, appeared on the title page of the U.S. magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the ambassador of the Easte Lauder sign, who led the campaign week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on his account at Instagram.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry on this title page," wrote Kendall.
The release of the title page followed a weird (or simply a continuation of humorous presentation of Cardassian?) staged video in which the entire family of Cardassian-Jenner (e.g., Rob and Caitly and together with all their favorite girls from the showhouse, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). On the cover of their sisters forgot that the scene could end in a classic fashion: they are preparing a secret party.
It's a protected history line almost every "natural" part of a child television show (Seacrest says: "You think we forgot about you?" with the integrity of the King painted in order to be eight o'clock in the morning), but Christ somehow needed to make sure the other girls could live on this publication.
Because when we look at the serial number of Vogue magazine, we've definitely entered the new era of the Cardassians.
The older sister Kim might have hit Kendall at Vogue Bay (she was on her side with her husband Kanye Westem in April 2014), but the title of the magazine's final issue is different.
The latest issue of the Vogue magazine is the most sold number of the year.
The edition, which reminds its editor of the book for advertising purposes rather than the fashion magazine, fits the whole range of authors (Fashionist calculated that from 832 pages in the London edition there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The discovery of a star that appears on the title page is unexpected, so it is not surprising that in the past two years, photographs of the magazine have been absent before its official publication.
Among the women who were discovered in the past are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelist or Kate Moss.
In recent years, more "celebrites making models" have appeared on the title page than "models that are celebrites".
Jennifer Lawrence, the holder of Oscar and Ambassador of Dior's sign, appeared on the title in 2013, and the year later, she had the honor of Lady Gaga.
But although it is very unlikely that Kendall - whose magazine describes her generation as a "proportional model" - falls into the first category, will be in very good company.
These celebrities are not friendly people, nor are the stars of real events, or children today who know how to do a well-founded video (even if Jenner represents all of this).
These are clearly talented women who are outstanding in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the title page, had one of the most powerful years in her career thanks to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course not everyone's success is achieved by Jenner.
Her position in the world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality of the show.
Stephanie Seymor's original model Victoria's Secret criticized Jenner and her colleague Gig Hadid in June and called her "girls at the moment".
These feelings were echoed again by the news that Jenner appeared on Vogue's shore.
But this discomfort isn't on the spot.
Kendall Jenner's on the edge of the orange Vogue.
It's a supermodel in the right sense.
It's for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you make up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own pajamas.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who photographed her for Love's magazine.
And in free moments it works in reality show, maybe just like one of the ways to see Kurtney and her children.
The Community Centre for Legal Aid for the annual rejection of 160 000 people
More than 160 000 of the most threatened citizens are denied legal aid each year in Community centres and are affected by the effects of other restrictions on the provision of services already under way.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly people of advanced age, immigrants, menace workers, victims of violence and people without financial means to combat unfair movement and similar - are already refusing when they seek free legal aid and representation.
Community legal services which are already so busy to be harvested are destined for other drawings.
Since June the following year, this centre will be assisted by another 30 per cent federal funding.
The director of the Community Aid Centre in Queensland, James Farrell, said that according to the latest comprehensive report of the National Association of Community Aid Centres, it was found that five thousand people were rejected annually.
Mr Farrell said the situation would be worse without the federal government's decision.
"The Community legal aid centres in Queensland are temporarily sub-funded, which means that thousands of people are denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who have avoided relationships with violence, people who have excessive and protective debt, families who have made decisions, workers who are unjustly released - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not have the opportunity to get the help they need.
The federal government has reduced funding by 30 per cent since June 2017, leading to the fact that thousands of other people in Queensland are going to have to focus on complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the national representative and Senator Queensland George Brandise to prevent this financial downturn immediately so that people can get the help they need when they get into legal problems.
In the current year, the government has received its obligation to ensure legal aid financing up to the international average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community legal aid centres and their clients' communities and the Palestinian Government must invest in this important work.
Request for the Donald Trump campaign after a member of the staff has apparently intended a weapon
New York: On the Donalda Trump campaign, a complaint was filed for certain inaction after they were informed that the operating director in North Carolina had intended a weapon on the floor during a raid.
The incident was described in a court letter, which was handed over by Vincent Bordeaux, former public law student of the state.
Bordini said that he waited for months to come to an internal solution before he came to the conclusion that "it will not happen".
Director Earl Phillip "signed his finger guns, gave the right indicator on the trigger and directed Vincent's head to the Czech," Bordi complained.
The list states that after difficulties in the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordeaux found that at least four others had experienced the same experience with Phillip.
"The weapon must not be shot in order to cause damage," Boroni complained.
The complaint will only come two days after the Republican candidate appealed to the president when he said to the voters in North Carolina that they could cut off the owners and holders of weapons (which is corrected in the second addendum to the Constitution), if his opponent, Hilary Clinton's election and he will be able to appoint his own judge.
The Trump campaign says that the media broke his words out of context and that Trump did not resort to violence.
Bordini in the complaint calls for the campaign for immediate supervision and from Phillip for the threat of personal security, illegal use of violence and caused emotional harm.
The trumpeter's spokesman Hope Hicks didn't respond immediately to the request for a comment.
The attempt to get an expression from Phillip was unsuccessful.
WCCB, the local news site in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
The phone to his advisory company Innovative Consulting Services no one responded in a short time.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump is conducting a controversial pre-election campaign.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic Spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and for London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is an enormous way, just like London 2012, when we have developed extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to draw from the Olympic Games.
The Olympics meant huge profits for Starford and East End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities only, we create 10,000 new research sites, 40,000 new jobs and end up with the unemployment of young people around the airport.
Just as before the London Olympics in 2012, there will also be those who will think that Heathrow's expansion is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would be laughing at the world scene.
The suspects were mistaken in 2012 and in the case of Heathrow, it is also shown that they did not have the truth.
Heathrow can answer every question that concerns him.
Like Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project where many people and companies are involved, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180 000 new jobs, an economic growth of 211 billion pounds, to leave the legacy in terms of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout Great Britain.
We have a great team at Heathrow which, in the term and with the planned budget, has launched an investment programme for the infrastructure of 11 billion pounds, starting with the T5 terminal - which was chosen the best terminal in the world for five years after the T2 terminal, which was established between two of the world's worst wounds.
Now they're ready to add the third floor, which represents 16 billion free private investment.
The games in London in 2012 were a great success for Britain and I am convinced that Heathrow's expansion will be also.
It's time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic heroes and expand Heathrow, ensure trade in the future and leave the legacy of skills and jobs that can be won by Britain.

Adblock Plus - Facebook in the game on the cat and mouse in blocking advertising
Among the attempts to cover the advertising blocking programs, for companies that make online marketing, the game has become a cat and mouse. At least it claims one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus published a contribution on its pages indicating that users can update filters in their program and re-block advertising on this social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook indicated that its desktop pages will change encoding around advertising to make advertising filters more complex to find out which parts of the pages are advertising.
Adblock says now that the new codes are already broken.
Speaking Adblock Ben Williams wrote in his blog post that "this war between the community open source of blockage advertising and those who try to cover it lasts from the time the blockade was found," and that Facebook is likely to come with another own cure.
The fact that the company itself has entered the world's largest social network in the war only demonstrates how a major problem of blocking advertising for industry has been.
According to a study conducted by Page Fair and Adobe, advertising filters are used worldwide for about 200 million people - almost fourteen percent before it was in 2013.
Mobile advertising now results in 84% of the profits from Facebook advertising, each day from mobile devices visits 1.03 billion active users.
The speaker pointed out that the company goes against advertising filters on the desktop because mobile advertising filters on mobile applications for social networks and Instagram do not work.
Advertising on the desktop is still making profits so high that Facebook decided to invest in it.
Facebook also indicated on Tuesday that it will update the Ad Preferences tool to give people a better chance to control how advertising is displayed to them.
On Thursday, Facebook announced that the new Adblock filters are concerned because they could also block content that does not depend on advertising.
"It is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," said the speaker Facebook in an e-mail statement.
The blocking of advertising is an unfeeling tool, and that is why we prefer to focus on building tools such as Ad Preferences that give control to people.
A woman hit a car on the Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the street in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses of an incident that took place on Thursday morning in the early hours of the morning at a distance of several cars caught by a woman who was likely trying to commit suicide.
The accident occurred in the A1 distance near Morges in the Vaud canton shortly after midnight in November.
The police in Vaud reported that the "dangerous act" actor was lying in the dark on the road and passed her a couple of cars.
It is clear that the victim, a 49-year-old woman, wanted to kill herself and hit her with several cars, including a freight vehicle.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but according to the police, not all have been identified yet. The police call these drivers and all the others who have been Witnesses are not willing to sign in.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, said for Le Tribune de Geneva legal representative Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to find out whether any of the drivers involved will face any charge.
Was it possible to prevent this?
This must be found by the complainant," said Hofstutter.
On the basis of two similar cases in the five years elapsed, it appears that drivers will not be responsible.
In both cases - one of which dealt with a person coming across the distance - it was decided that the motorists could not expect the walkers who pass through the streets during the night, as the newspapers indicated.
Last year the police station was released from the charge of mass murder after it hit and died on the night of July 2014 at A1 near Payinner.
The court found that the victim had been drinking alcohol at the age of 22 and had been driving on the road.
The Court found that the police station - which responded to the emergency call - was eating in an appropriate manner and that the presence of a man on the road was "all exceptional and unpredictable," the judge said.
Any person with information on the fourth incident that occurred in Morges should report to the police on telephone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Praha is a favorite destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Offices and Agency (AČCKA) is expected to reach up to 20,000 visitors within Prague Pride.
On Friday, the Executive Director of AČCKA Katerín Petríčková announced it.
The 6th anniversary of Prague Pride started on 8 August, the festival approaches the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
Loni participated in the campaign about 35,000 people.
"The bridge is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, which is for high-level tolerance and a wide range of specialised enterprises," Petríčkov said.
According to a survey by the organizers, foreign visitors lose an average of 3100 koruna per person per day.
Gay tourists are supporting their trips to the special map of Prague with a complete list of Prague gays and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants like mobile applications etc.
"For travel it is generally paid that LGBT client is very lucrative, interested in staying in higher price relations with high standard travel services and loss more than others," Petríčkova said.
The festival is held this year as well as the first Prede Tourism Symposium.
It is presented by experts from the LGBT travel sector from Europe, the United States and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, 14 August.
The main theme of this year is love, but action will also be devoted to a number of thematic areas that are family, AIDS prevention and transgender problems.
The festival will be held on Saturday with allegorical cars coming from Václav’s village in summer.
The reason thousands of people participated in last year's event this year is a moment's silent memory of the victim of a red attack at a night club in Orland where 49 people were shot, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Ma celebrates for forty years.
The inexhaustible boxing Pat and Mat, whose effort usually ends in disaster, has been playing small and great miracles for 40 years.
The pilot part of this evening series of director Lubomír Benesh was Prime Minister on 12 August 1976.
As a result of this animated series, which now knows more than a hundred fans in more than a hundred countries of the world, the artist and director of Lubomír Beneshe, who was thinking about the magazine with two boxes of Mr. Ouholíček and Mr. Sedlec.
Benez then called for the cooperation of Jiři Kubičk's dramaturk and the designer Vladimír Jiranka and together they produced the film Kućáci.
Today’s picture of the yellow and red triangle and of the tower and radio reached the building in 1979 when it began in the short film Praha to produce a series for Slovenian television.
The names Pat and Mat were obtained in 1985, this time directly for the short film Praha.
In 1990 Lubomír Benez founded his own animated studio of AIF Studio in Prague and Curych, where other parts emerged.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other forms, many of which were shared by Benez son of Marek.
At present there are more than nine episodes with the stories of these boxes that all fall under their hands, but they never fall on themselves and are always full of optimism, ideas, and tastes, and finally they are calm with their part, which is a well-known gesture "...and it is!".
Pat and Mat even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theaters or other games with the appearance of Pat and Mat are an emergency for each game.
It's for Fiji and for two-year-old Harmony.
At the end of the week it's in the meaning of the event, we've chosen for you one sports and one of life.
They both have a good end.
Let's see.
Fiji has achieved its historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and she's happy with her.
And what do people spend most of their time at airports for?
It's a fifth view of the world's websites.
The first medal from the Olympics.
Historic success celebrates Fiji's island state.
The Ragby election of this neighbor won in the final Olympic tournament of the seven-week strike team of the Great Britain.
It's just the first medal that Fiji won for himself on the Olympics.
Waiting for the profit of the first prize stone took sixty years since the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
A great deal of success is given to Coach Fiji.
But it's ironic that he's got Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the end that the British citizen could be at peace with their own countries.
"Let's play free and easy and see if we can get the biggest game in our history," said the coach before the final.
Fiji finally ruled over it, and the small state of 900,000 inhabitants now live in the Olympic Games.
The French daily Le Monde brought the report.
A new friend and luck for a little girl.
2 years of Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, who has lived without arms and arms for 11 months, got a new friend.
A girl who looks like her.
"Mummy, she's like me," pleased a two-year-old girl as her mother betrayed her for ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to hang her hands and feet and then she sits together without a protégé.
Harmony has been diagnosed with meningitis type B throughout life, and doctors have only given her a ten percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't like about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny and she's never giving up.
He's got surveillance.
I saw her presenting her with the other kids with the words "Hi, I'm Harmony and I don't have my hands," she added.
Look at the joy of the girl.
What do we spend most on the airport for?
CNN provides information that allows people on airports to spend most of their time on balloon water.
Tenth sales Hudson's travel essential stores published data in the last year, where it collects 10 products that customers in its airlines buy most often.
The water was sovereignly first.
The drinks were generally very popular, eight of them were placed in the first ten.
The 9th place contained large M&M balloons with coconut juice.
And you can guess who's closing the first ten?
As the only one of the above cannot eat.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Among other popular newspapers sold on airports are New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Allerious sovereigns.
We're just gonna win, they're laughing at Murray and Bond.
The Veslars Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have sovereignly ruled two categories without a cormide for seven years and their dominants have also confirmed the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, two of them went to the smaller post-Olympia group in Beijing and since 2009.
At Rodriga de Freitas' fair, 69th winnings were awarded in the fourth final.
What are we different from the others?
We're just pretty, Murray's already joked during the Olympic regatta when he had to answer questions about the Dominance of New Zealand's Two.
Honestly, we're not doing anything different than the others.
We're just training hard, very hard.
And we're still trying to improve our technology, it's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their power is remarkable even because they are physically different.
Murray is almost two-foot and glass chassis, academically looking Bond is five inches less and 15 kilograms less.
They also have a different attitude.
Bond's studying and committed to finance, Murray's got, for example, a charity boxer game.
That's why it doesn't take too much time to be together.
Eric's on board basically because we can't lose.
We're just gonna win.
I have a tendency to think about what can be seen, the Bond acknowledged, which at the press conference pointed out clearly that the dominant in the team is Murray.
He always answered as the first and Bond waited for his chance.
However, he does not resist the mild force on the water.
They eat their pace, and often half of them are not in their head, and their gradual acceleration has not yet been found by opponents.
We're going to take a two-kilometre trail and we never wanted to go the first mile back.
We're just trying to go for a while that no one else can.
We know what we need to do to win, said four-year-old Murray.
With his four - year - old partner, he won seven gold medals for the world's mysteries.
They even triumphed in 2007, when both members of the gold fours were without cormorants.
Immediately after the unexpected failure of the larger teams at the Beijing Olympics, they decided to move to a couple without a cormide.
At the Olympics in London, the biggest winner of their careers apparently opened up and the dominants confirmed it in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it would be very hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally well on it, Murray said.
We know we all want to get out of the throne.
We're still on the back.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everybody, he added.
NASA climate model: Venice was once a citizen
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was once a citizen.
Scientists at the NASA Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for testing Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by scientists living with climate study.
The model was designed to determine whether the weather in Venice, whose surface is hot, without water and CO2, could change conditions similar to the conditions on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low speed of the Venus return can explain its harsh atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, however, Venus seems to have ever been able to rise to a rare atmosphere like Earth and then gradually retreated.
The model also survived the previous Venus topography.
The planet is likely to have a much shorter area than it is on Earth, but when it has had enough water and earth’s diversity to control life and provide protection from rapid recovery.
Venus also used the sun, which was about 30 percent slower.
"In the simulation of the GISS Venus model during a slow turn, its daily side to the sun is almost two months away," explains GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This leads to the burning of the surface and the formation of rain that creates a dense variety of clouds that act as rain and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is the atmosphere with average temperatures that are actually less than the present time on Earth.
The model of the Venus story is similar to the evolution of the planetary scientists of the past.
Even though Venus was probably civilized in the past -- over a few billion years -- it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans disappeared and her water pairs were lit with ultraviolet light.
The water disappeared and left only the harsh atmosphere of the acidic atmosphere with the deadly effect of the greenhouse gas -- it's Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy refused to post coach Colorado Avalanche
On Thursday Patrick Roy rejected his trainer post and vice-president of hockey operations team Colorado Avalanche, giving reasons for not being able to participate in the decision-making process in the team's issues.
The Executive Vice-President/General Manager Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the step and indicated that the club will immediately start looking for a new trainer.
"For the past three years, I have served as the main coach and vice-president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche with energy, yours and yours," Roy said in his statement.
Over the years, I've been thinking about how I can improve the team, give him the depth he needs, and get her to a higher level.
To achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice-president of hockey operations be in line with the vision of the organisation.
It must also be possible to participate in decisions affecting the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roye on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his team's contributions.
"Patric informed me of his decision today," said Sakic.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we take him into the future with great happiness.
Roy was nominated for Jack Adamse's win as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to win 112 points and the first place in the Central Division. Colorado, however, ran with Minnesota in the first round of play-off and during the last two years, he had not always had a game after the season.
The Avalanche team in the 2015/2016 season got score 39:39:4 and missed five points to get another wild card at the Western Conference.
The banker Roy, who wrote to China's glory, won Stanley Cup four times -- twice with Montreal Canadiens and twice with Avalanche.
Workers at the Red Sea are renewing the talks and interrupting the stage
The top representatives of the parties pointed out that the rates due to the charge for workers in the North Sea have been suspended while all parties to the dispute have reached a new round of mergers.
To stand against the service company for the wood group’s oil field, it has reached the areas of the North Sea, which runs the Royal Dutch Shell company.
"Wood Group and the Union and RMT committee organisations may confirm that they have agreed to renew the process for resolving current disputes," says the statement.
Starting next week, we'll have a few weeks of round-the-clock meetings, where we'll try to look at new challenges.
According to the committee organisations, their recent actions, which were first in terms of more than 25 years, have been protesting against munitions of up to 30 per cent.
In this year's year, Wood Group has reduced rates and paid its suppliers in the North Sea about 9 per cent less because of negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates is due to a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that other paintings would give companies space to deal with the market collapse.
On the other hand, Shell drew thousands of people out of its payrolls and announced plans to leave operations on land and land flow to 10 countries due to the modernization of its processes - immediately after the mega phase with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the low prices of oil, the economic situation associated with the UK's red decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, a member of the Parliament from Scotland, Dave Anderson met with committee delegates to conduct one of the largest labour disputes of the entire generation, which led to the rise in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as he pointed out, is vital to the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for everyone, not just for some," he said.
For comparison, in 2016 approximately $1.4 billion is expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea, while the average in the last five years was about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of the star in Beaches
The most recent mission of Kepler's space telescope to help astronomers is to get almost complete list of the speedy orbit of the star from the Plejady star.
New data help astronomers understand why the stars in the constellations point at different speeds, as well as how the timing of rotation relates to the formation of the planets.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star purchases, we will learn more about the relationship between star weight, its age and even history in its solar system,” said Luisa Rebullová, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Plejady star shop is 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in the sky right now are reaching maturity and have resulted in over 125 million years.
He's leaving now as soon as he can.
In the immediate maximum speeds these emerging stars release huge amounts of star air.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with how old a star is, it's also reduced its speed of rotation.
Kepler is measuring the speed of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the disclosure of different points on the stars -- similar solar panels.
According to latest data on speeds, larger stars are smaller than the mass stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, making pirates smaller than you.
"In the "ballet" we see that the smaller the star points are more massive, whereas the fastest the stars are usually very easy," said Rebullová.
Because the star shop Plejad is so close, it serves as the ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of the star and its rapid rotation.
"The beaches provide us a box for theoretical models of star rotation into both directions, in younger and older stars," Rebulva said.
It's still a lot of things we want to learn about how when and why stars slow down their speed of rotation and say, "he's gonna put his dance boots on the grass."
Rebulló and her colleagues described in detail the latest analysis of the speed-up of Plejad in three studies that will soon be published in the Astronomic Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign up, then would the qualifying agreement fail and I could go to another hospital in a few months?
Is it really possible to work without being enrolled in specialized education after a study?
It is to me that in the area in which I would like to work, there is now a free job only in some more distant hospital, but a half-year-old hole could be set free in another place where I would like to work.
So I don't know how to solve the situation for half a year, the question goes on.
Mr. Lenka Vlkov's answer.
No legal provision shall lay down the obligation to conclude a qualifying agreement with employees - hospitals.
The qualifying agreement is a legal institution which manages the labour law and can be concluded between employees and employees in order to ensure the return of costs incurred related to raising or deepening the qualification of employees.
In the field of health, a long-term pressure on the conclusion of these agreements with a view to ensuring the employment mobility of health workers and not all hospitals are currently required by this agreement.
Act No. 95/2004 provides that the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional skills and specialised skills in the performance of the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, while explicitly paying that participation in specialisation education is considered to be a deepening of qualifications (no longer for its promotion).
This means that a qualifying agreement may be concluded under the labour law only if the costs reach at least 75 000 ECU.
There is no legal provision or obligation to participate in specialized education.
The Act only provides for conditions for the application for inclusion in the specialisation education.
However, the doctor is entitled under the law to make a doctor's call because of the training required for a university study, even if under the conditions laid down by the law (under the supervision of a doctor with a specialised competence in the relevant field).
The Law provides for a situation where a professional practice in other areas of specialized education may be established in the specialized training of a doctor if its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational programme.
Theoretically, it would be possible to calculate the time spent elsewhere, which would be in line with the situation.
However, given that I do not know the details of this case, it may be recommended to consult with the relevant Committee of the Ministry of Health (Scientific and Medical Appeals) of the Ministry of Health, as the Ministry of Health provides advice and advisory services related to specialized education and its duration.
The advice service also provides free of charge the Czech medical room to which each doctor must be a member.
Doctors from the Syrian Halabu are asking for an intervention from the United States.
The United States did not make any effort to end the siege (the rebel parts of the city by the government forces), and did not use its influence on the spread of the protection of civilians, quoted by the letter addressed to the White House of the AFP agency.
"We do not need tears, sympathy, or even prayers; however, we need to create an eastern Halab zone to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab will not be re-circulated," the doctors said.
The Russian forces that support the army, faithful President Bashar Asad, announced that today it will stop every day for three hours in the area of Halabu so that they can pass safely on to humanitarian combatants.
From 9:00 to 12:00 SELČ shall be stopped all military activities, air raids and gunfire.
The head of the UN humanitarian operations Stephen O'Brien welcomed it, but stressed that at least two-way approaches are needed.
According to the AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors who are taking action in the eastern part of Halabu are already in control of the rebellion.
He writes that during the five years of war, Witnesses were violent, cruel deaths from countless patients, friends, and colleagues.
The world looks at and sees how complex Syria is, but it's only doing a little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation from the Syrian regime and Russia seem to be just as easy as shots, pediatrics, surgeons and other doctors.
Doctors reported 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria over the past month, 15 of which were in hospitals where they work.
The saddest thing is that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
In preparation for us young children with such serious injuries that we have to choose between them which are the most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the material to help them, tell the doctors.
Two weeks ago, four neonatals were fired when the explosion broke the supply of oxygen to their incubators.
They dug after the rain and then ended their lives - before he could really start, they remembered.
The army, loyal to President Bashar Asad, who supports the Russian forces, in the past weeks surrounded the rebellion in the eastern part of Halabu, within which more than 200,000 people were fed without supplying food.
Rebels who were subjected to constant attacks by Russian and Syrian aircraft were subjected to a three-week break-in turn and start anti-thiophenicosis on Saturday.
Both sides then came to the city and its surrounding forces.
