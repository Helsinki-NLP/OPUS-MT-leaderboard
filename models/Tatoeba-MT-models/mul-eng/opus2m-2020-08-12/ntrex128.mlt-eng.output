AMs from Wales fear that "they look like fools"
There is coercion among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of Wales Parliament).
This was created due to plans for the change of the name of the Wales Parliament.
The AMs around the political spectrum are worried that this will make them look radical .
AM Laburista said his group was concerned that "this has the same sound as Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In the language of Wales twp means ibleh and pwp means rwt.
AAM of Plaid said the whole group was not content and suggested alternative.
Conservative by Wales said his group had "open mind" about the change in the name, but note that there was a small verbal difference from MWP to "Muppet".
In this context the letter and the language of Wales are similarly pronounced for the pronunciation of the letter and.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the changes in the name, said: "The final decision on any descriptive description of that should be called the Members of the Assembly will naturally be a matter for the members themselves."
The 2017 Walls Government Act empowered the Wales Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals which had broad support to call the Assembly Parliament of Wales.
On the issue of the title of AMs, the Commission favoured members of the Wales or WMPs Parliament, but MWP received most support in public consultation.
As it appears, AMs are suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching consensus can be a headache for the President-in-Office, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft legislation on changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the way the assembly works, including rules on the qualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have final votes on the question of how to call when they have a debate on legislation.
In Macedonia leaves public opinion in a referendum on the change in the name of the country
The voters will question the House on whether their country's name should be changed for the "Republic of Northern Macedonia."
The popular vote was set up with the aim of finding a solution to disputes that lasted decades with Greece's neighbouring country, which has its own province known as Macedonia.
Atheni has been insisting for a long time that the name of its tramway represents .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposition to the change in the name, said he would see the vote.
But referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in name is simply the consequence of EU and NATO entry.
St.Martin's Nipples Stop Jdocó as Knejes in Harlem
" Historically, the elders I talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Day after day, there's nothing."
He said he could understand how the bar broke out.
I said, "People socialize differently" today.
"The bar is no longer the centre of local activity where people go on a regular basis."
With regard to banks, it is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders think, "and today or again they will stop where they were at the beginning."
It is further possible to replace the nets with blocks of apartments with condoms filled with the type of people who will not help the rest of the premises.
"The great majority of people buying condoms in this building will be white charnage," he said, "and thus, they will not burn when it comes to the day that they are created for these chains because many of these people who enter these condoms will not be members of these condoms."
Both knees were built by congregations of white carnage people before Harlem became metropolis of white carnage - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St.Martin's ten years later.
The original White Carnage Men's Methodist Congregation arrived in the 1930s.
A congregation of black carnage people who were practicing religion soon took the title for the building.
St. Martin's was taken by a black carnage congregation under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a small shopkeeper in 125 Street, the main road to purchase in Harlem, which prevented renting or promotion of black carnage.
We left the building with serious damage in 1939, but just as Father Johnson's Parisians made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson's and the successor of St. Martin's, was proud when he called the cartoon "the people's nickname."
The expert who put the carillon in July called something else: "Cultural treasure" and "a unique historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that he was the first carillon in the world to have a black carnage musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to the largest carillon in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's hasn't changed with anyone else.
What happened in St. Martin's during the last few months was a complicated story of relatives and contractors, some introduced by the leaders of the local church, others from the Episcopal Diocese.
The 'vestry' - the ruling body of the parish, made up of leic leaders - wrote the dioceses in July with concern that the dioceses "will seek to pass the costs" to the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in capturing the pirates and contractors who sent from the diocese.
Some of the Parisians complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The sea bear gives birth to a 13-year-old child in California for a stay of breeding
The heart of the sea attacked and fathered a 13-year-old child on the Sabbath while he was giving birth in California on the day of the opening of the autumn season, the officials said.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. where Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was going to spend about half an hour with his friend on Saturday morning when one week the child cried for help and then came along with a group to help get out of the water.
Hammel said that for the first time he thought it was the excitement of after he fell asleep, but then "the reality that he was crying, 'Gidini!
I'm going!'
He learned and opened all the piano," Hammel said he realized the moment the child arrived.
"I lived to everybody get out of the water: 'There's a dog in the water!' Hammel added.
Take the child by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The fish species responsible for the attack were not known.
The Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said at a meeting with the average seabird caught in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a species of dangerous seabird.
Giles added that the victim had caused traumatic disturbances in the upper part of the torso.
Officials for access to cattle from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swamis in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of fish in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Saninsbury's plans enter the United Kingdom's prosperity market
Saninsbury's is competing against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with trailer corridors similar to those of the 'store department' of filling products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial market entry of £2.8 billion in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow while sales of clothing and household items decreases, the larger corridors with household products will be tested in 11 months across the country and the idea will be spent in more than a year if it is successful.
The investment in ivory was after the supermarkets were looking for ways to use the space on the stove that had once been used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Saninsbury's said it will double the amount of jewelry that is offering up to 3000 items, including diets such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
A range of existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space with areas similar to those found in such boats as Boots.
The supermarket will also re-launch its Boutique's makeup range so that most products are good for vegans - something that is increasingly required by smaller buyers.
In addition, the retail seller of Fragrance Shop will examine concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, which first opened in Croydon, London below, next week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and changing to buying with small amounts of daily food in local convention facilities means that supermarkets are having to do more to get people out of there.
Mike Coupe, the executive head of Saninsbury's, said that the shops will become more and more like ‘department stores’ as the supermarket chain tries to fight against the companies that account for Aldi and Lidl prices with more services and non-food products.
Saninsbury’s past puts Argos’ shops in hundreds of shops and also introduced a number of Habitats because it spent the two chains two years ago, which says it strengthened market sales and made more profits.
The previous overmarket attempt to refurbish the recovery and expansion departments failed.
Saninsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots at the beginning of the year 2000, but the relationship ended after a fight on how to share the revenue from the costs in its supermarkets.
The new strategy entered after Saninsbury sold the spy business by 281 gave Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million, three years ago.
Lloyds said he would play a role in the plan by increasing an extended range of luxurious skin care diets including La Roche-Posay and Vichi in four friends.
Paul Fromls-Hicks, the business director of Saninsbury's, said: "We transform the appearance and sensation of our well-being corridors for improving the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in schools that have been trained in a special way that will be available to offer advice.
The range of our fingertips has been designed to be appropriate for every need and the environment that attracts you and the convenient positions of the wheels mean that we have a destination for the products of interest which challenge the old way of buying."
Peter Jones 'very upset' after Holly Willoughby cancels an agreement of £11 million
The personality of Dragons Den Peter Jones 'very angry' after TV Holly Willoughby television presenters canceled an agreement of £11 million with the business of his life-style poet to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for feeding their home products and accessories, Truly.
The couple's business was compared to the poet Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce that you will be leaving.
Holly Willoughby let the personality of Dragons" De Peter Jones became very angry because it was canceled from being part of their life-style diet business that makes a lot of money in the last minute - to focus on its major contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was "very angry" when the popular television personality was widely approved during an intense meeting on Wednesday in his huge business districts in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, whose new agreements - with a value of up to £1.5 million - were found to be not enough time to dedicate their number of home products and accessories, Truly.
The business was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow Goop's poet and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated well-known £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce that he was going to leave with Truly, Jones left Britain and went to one of his private travelers.
Sors said: "Truly was quite Holly's first priority.
It would be her future in the long run which would fill the next decades.
Her decision to leave has left all completely welcome.
No one could believe what was happening on Wednesday, the launch was almost over.
There is a full stock of products in Marlow's general quarters which are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning's representatives, which is among the Britain's profit-generating personalities, can mean a cost of millions for the company due to a large investment in products from furniture and furniture and household products, and the potential for further delays until its launch.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three children, Willoughby and her brother Dan Baldwin have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as Chairman Charman in March.
The couple agree and Jones has a 40 per cent share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become a M&S Dict ambassador and will be replaced by Ant McPartlin as an I'm A Celebrate of ITV.
Friday evening, a source near Jones said, "We don't comment on his economic affairs."
Hard meeting 'but then we found love'
He is shocked at a criticism that will come from the news media because he commented that some people consider "not presidential" and that he was so positive about North Korea's leadership.
Why did President Trump go so far?
Trump said with a voice that admires that of the "reporter".
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump opened that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearisation ceased.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the most diplomatic of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders on Saturday at the General Assembly, that North Korea did not see "responsible response" by the United States for the early steps of North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, note, the United States is continuing with sanctions aimed at keeping pressure.
Trump understood much more optimistic in the speech of his demonstration.
He said, "We're good with North Korea."
"We would go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have this very good relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results - the end of rocket tests, rescue aid for the remaining American veterans and return home.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter this arena filled with people, we had about 200 people standing there," Trump said, and pointed to the crowd directly ahead.
Tsunami and Terremoth in Indonesia Destroy Island, Killing Hundreds of People
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not required.
Even after more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had to move from their homes, no national disaster was declared, a requirement to catalyse international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it was very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it was a challenge," said Mr. Sumbung.
While saving the Children is organizing a team to travel to Paul, it is not clear whether foreign personnel can operate on site.
Mr Sutopo, speaking of the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
In view of the frequently occurring earthquakes in Indonesia, the country has not been well prepared for the great anger of nature.
While one of the tsunamis was built in Aceh, they were not very visible to the coast.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite a warning issue, was likely contributing to the loss of lives.
In the best of times, travel between the numerous islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics more complex.
The hospital ship was stationed in Lombok for the treatment of the victims on its way to Paul, but it will last for at least three days to arrive at the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has improved the infrastructure that falls short of Indonesia, its electoral campaign centre, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Mr Joko's administration has given rise to the lack of funds as he faces his election again last year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from sectoral tensions that are still in Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative form of these beliefs.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes as insara gangs and Muslims fought on the road, using ‘machetes’, force and missiles and other types of weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool brings the points of size in the last minute vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League against Chelsea with 'goal' at 89 minutes on Saturday inside Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received the balloon from Xherdan Shaqiri while it was 27 metres away from Chelsea's fate by his team that was losing 1-0.
I took the balloon a little to his left before saving the ball in the closet.
The balloon of a lot above the box as soon as it entered the left-hand side of the box.
Eventually, the balloon fell after Kepa Arrizabalaga, who passed to try to fall down, and fell into the hole.
"I'm trying to get into that position, to get into the ball and players like Shaq always sends him forward as soon as possible, so I tried to give me time to myself as much as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come up and put the ball once and didn't think too much about it and tried to shoot the ball."
Chelsea was playing 1-0 to half the game after bringing 'goal' in 25 minutes from the very good player Belgium Eden Hazard.
Chelsea's sticker broke the ball back to Matthew Kovacic, before it happened to the middle of the garden and then quickly entered into the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic immediately disassembled the balloon into half-grawd.
Then save the balloon very well, which led to Hazard inside the box.
Hazard was born more than the players in the defense and sent the balloon into the cage with the selugion seal and passed from where Alison Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool fights against Naples at the season of the Champions League groups on Wednesday afternoon next Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the EUFA League on the 3rd afternoon following Friday in London.
The number of deaths in Indonesia tsunamis falls to 832
The number of deaths in Indonesia's tsunamis amounted to 832, said the country's disaster agency early this morning.
Many people have been reported arrested under the construction investigation due to the 7.5 earthquake that took place last week and caused up to 20 feet high, said a statement by the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was filled with freezing from the remaining buildings.

The status of the Cromwell Parliament becomes the last monument drawn from the argument on the 're-write of history'
Its removal is a form of appropriate justice for the collapse similar to that of the Taliban, of many of the religious and cultural English works performed by its fanatic ‘Puritan’ followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "majun" and "an attempt to re-write history."
John Goldsmith, President of Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of states that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster Palace would be targeted.
The 'iconoclasm' of the English civil war was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's evil was sacrificed for the actions of his antanat Thomas in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of a 19th-century opinion and part of the story of a figure that many believe is still to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defense of Parliament against external pressure, in its case, of course, the monarchy.
If this is a fully precise representation it is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century forms the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure known to represent one side of that area.
His achievements as the Lord Protector also prepare them to be celebrated and commemorated."
Cuttlefish Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmers
Farms have been attacked and killed by a flood on a market in the Chinese Lviv, according to local media reports.
The man, only identified with his nickname "Yuan," was found dead with fallen artery, given blood at the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post.
Dog farmers are preparing to inject the vaccines into the dog in ‘hoggery’ on 30 May 2005 in Xining of the Province of Qinghai, China.
Allegedly, he traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 stores on the market.
In the morning, his kitchen was found dead, and he discovered a door for the dog’s slaughter near the open.
I said there was a bleeding hole in your mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg period had been attacked and killed by farmers, according to the report.
"Two kitchen legs were bleeding and mutilated," said the cook, who referred to him with his conjom "Wu," as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera films showed Yuan entering the market on Friday morning at 4.40 p.m. to finish his dog.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that told Yuan was not Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the bridge was closed to prevent other workers, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of seizures of humans have been previously registered.
In 2016, he attacked his wife and her husband in their hometown in Massachusetts, and the man was critically ill.
Ten years ago, a distance of 295 kg kept a shift from Wales to its tractor until his wife was killed.
After a farmer from Oregon attacked and killed him in 2012, farmers from Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pigs were not normally aggressive but the blood pressure could act as a "cause."
"You'll be playing.
They're praying, they're very curious... they don't intend to bother you.
Only you have to show them the appropriate amount of respect," he said.
The remains of Uragan Rosa will bring a strong blow spread in the U.S. Wall
As it has been passed, the Rosa Uragan is sinking as it walks on the hottest waters of the Mexican coastal coast.
However, Rosa will bring a flood flood around Mexico’s coast and across the United States next day.
Rosa brought a breath of 85 mph, Category 1, Uragan on the 5th of the morning in the Middle East, and was located 385 miles from the direction of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to go to the mountains in the morning.
Meanwhile, it is forming a ‘trough’ on the Pacific Ocean and is heading east to the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa is approaching the Baja California peninsula in the afternoon as a tropical nightmare, she will start pushing strong tropical humidity in the direction of the tramway towards the United States Lviv
On Tuesday, Rosa will bring up to 10 pulsies of tea in parts of Mexico.
Then, a tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching ‘trough’ creates a strong wave spread in the next day’s Xlok.
Locally, from 1 to 4 inches of grass will cause rapid flooding, floods of waste and the possibility of valanga in the desert.
A strong tropical humidity will cause the rat rates to range from 2 to 3 inches per hour in parts, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
From 2 to 4 packs of tea are expected in parts of the Lbic, especially on a large part from Arizona.
The rapid decline is possible with conditions that quickly deteriorate due to the spread of tropical heat.
It is not a good idea to go out in the desert walking with the threat of tropical heat.
A pregnant woman may cause the ‘canyons’ to become dangerous flies and maltempitants will bring up plants that are very local and dusty.
The ‘trough’ will bring some jokes to parts of the southern coast of California.
They are possible total of more than half a inch of grass, which can cause small flows of freezing and rolling roads.
This is the first joke of their summer season region.
Some frozen tropical salts begin to reach Arizona after Friday and early Tuesday, before the hottest after Tuesday and Wednesday.
A strong arrow spreads into Four Corners on Wednesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October there may be a strong change in temperature across the United States as much as the Arctic does, but tropical areas remain rather hot.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature on short distances.
There will be a great example of dramatic differences in temperature from the United States Centre in Friday.
There is almost a difference in the temperature of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next days, the remaining melting heat will try to develop and expand again.
A large part of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a hot start in October at temperatures in the 80s scattered by the South to parts of Greece.
New York City can rise to 80 degrees in the morning on Wednesday, which is about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high possibilities for temperatures above the average for the United States East during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's meeting
More than 20 million people saw the very interesting witness on Friday of the candidate appointed by the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman accused of having committed an alleged sexual attack in the last eight years, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
However, the political struggle continued, with the scandal interrupting regular programming with the shocking news of the last minute of the week: an agreement drawn up by the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a case-week investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it is a certain 100 percent that Kavanaugh Babasha was under the influence of alcohol and tried to remove her clothes when she was a post-secondary school festival.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate witness, said he was 100 percent sure this didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen last week have seen it.
the company was offering the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks showing them, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen generally finds it difficult to calculate how many spectators there are from offices.
In order to put this in perspective, it is a size similar to that for the decisive football game or for the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinioners strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was on the front of all networks with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the full-day session, Nielsen said.
ABC was just following it with 3.26 million telescopes.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest remained high after the meeting.
Flake was the central figure in the Sunday drama.
After the moderate Republic office issued a statement that would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, those who protested by CNN and CBS cameras this morning were shouting at them as they tried to leave for the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He is still standing with his eyes looking down for several minutes as he was being aggressively criticised, in a direct broadcast on CNN.
"He's standing here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think you're telling the truth to the country?
He said "You have the power when many women have nothing."
Flake said that his office issued a statement and said, before closing the ceiling of the elevator, that he would have more to say at the committee's meeting.
All cable and broadband networks were spreading directly, hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance the name of Kavanaugh for the Senate in full for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the person nominated next week, which democratic minorities encourage.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several years later, Flake made his decision.
Fleke’s decision had power, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation on allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May blames critics "take advantage of politics" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of its plans to leave the European Union "take advantage" of policy and weaken national interest in interviewing the Sunday Times newspaper.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her ex-Minister for Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson expressed his attack by the so-called ‘Checkers’ Plan for Brexit, and he said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the tariffs of each other was "completely rejected".
Shooting on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson after the death of LSU player
The police arrested a person suspected of shooting who told Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on a second-grad murder case, said Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his nails during the war.
The police recovered the needles from the spot and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports the CBS affiliate, WAFB.
After Simpson was questioned, the police told him to allow him to shoot and kill Wade.
Its bond was set at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge parish office issued a preliminary report last week, which stated that the cause of death is an injury to a gun from the neck to neck.
The department is granting credit to the task force of the petitioners of the State Police of Louisiana, the state police crime laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the enforcement of the area law for "diligence and the search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The attack that was 2 metres long, dust in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 ‘rebounds’ each game in the past season.
The next week, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach said that the team is "lost" and "under shock" after Wade's death.
"This is what worries him all the time," said Wade.
Vulcan smells on Mexico City
Immunities that are being eliminated by the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern regions of the capitals of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre is intended for Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater activity has increased and 183 gas emissions and greenhouse gas emissions have been recorded within 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring several hearings and tissue movements.
Social media prints have shown a lot of noise from passing car windscreens near Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geology physicists noted an increase in the activity in the volcano of 45 miles (72 km) in the capital area following a 7.1 earthquake in the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police have a conflict with Catholics' separatists before the anniversary of the vote of independence
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrations in favour of independence had conflict with the anti-fraud police, and as thousands joined with rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catholic polarisation vote on the secesion.
A group of separatists with face-to-faces who were held back from the anti-vehicle police were turned into pigs' eggs and pigs' eggs, and created dark companions of pigs on the streets which were usually filled with tourists.
There was also a small fight during the day and the police had to use the limbs to control the fight.
Over a period of several hours, groups in favour of independence were saying "I can't, I don't regret" fighting against Union protesters who were crying, "Spain forever."
Forty people received treatment for minor corrections received in the protests, local press reported.
Tenions remained high in the region which required one year's independence after the October 1st referendum considered unlawful by Madrid but which were celebrated by Catholic separatists.
The voters chose with a large disc to become independent, although participation was low with those who opposed the secession which made a large ballot against the vote.
According to the Catholic authorities, almost 1,000 people spent the next year after the police tried to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region in violent wars.
Independent groups had campaigned during the night last week to prevent demonstrations with support for national police.
The demonstration was performed but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electricist waiting for the separatist protest in March said they did not hope for the prospects of independence for Catalonia.
"The other year we live one of our best moments.
I went to my mother and father to remain happy that they could wear but now we are free," he said.
Despite having had vital gains and weaknesses in the regional elections last December, the parties to the independence of Catalonia are sending to maintain the moment of the year with many of their best-known leaders or on the island they have decided themselves or in detention and are waiting for the process due to their role in the referendum organisation and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was registering the protest on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was caused by both sides' policies.
"There will be more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders who are imprisoned before the end of the next year's process, announced that he will contest in the European Parliament's elections the coming year.
"By going out as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in the democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after the car entered the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after more than once entering a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Friday for the arrest of 19:30 BST.
Investigative inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the grades and buildings themselves.
It has also been used 'crossbow' to save to the car at some point.
Menga Goal wins 1-0 game for Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first 'goal' for Livingston won the game
Livingston, who was promoted, praised Rangers and thus Steven Gerrard lost for the second time only in 18 games as a box of Ibrox's club.
The shooting of Dolly Menga's balloon made the difference as Gary Holt's side was equal in points with Hibernian in second place.
The side of Gerard has not yet won out of its prize in the Premiership at this stage and the next work will play against Hearts, who are the first and who are behind them with eight points.
Before that game, Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna in their grand in Europe League on Friday.
While Livingston continues to have no losses in the division in six games, with the main box Holt that doesn't lose a game from time to time has been replaced by Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against goffi visitors
Holt's team came before he was winning before he had 'goal', with the direct style of his game that was causing a lot of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but split the ball before the deck, then Alan Lithgow could only split the ball with a large bow after he ran to get the ball from the race from Craig Halkett beyond the deck.
Those who were playing in their own garden were happy to let Rangers play before them, because they knew that visitors could see the problems at some point.
And that was the way he reached the crucial 'goal'.
Rangers allowed 'free-kick' to come in and Livingston took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who put the ball in and put it inside the box center.
By that time, Rangers were governing the possession of the balloon, but they were finding the team's defense that was playing in their own throat, non-enterprising, and the 'goalkeeper' Liam Kelly had little concern,
That style of games continued even in the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos gave Kelly the ball.
Scott Pittman failed to find 'goal' due to the 'goalkeeper' of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow saved the balloon in a large way after killing another player in Livingston.
Blalen was all the time into Livingston's box and was always removed from their players, while two requests for 'penalty' - after Halkett's attempt on Glenn Middleton's replacement, and another after the balloon was sent by the hands of the players - were rejected.
Phenomenals from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland inside Arena Tony Macaroni
Feminine performance and result for Livingston.
For men, they were excellent, they continued to exceed the expectations on this third trajectory.
The style of the games and their staff have not changed much from the return to the main struggle, but the most credit should go to Holt for the way the team has gathered since it arrived.
He had a lot of energy.
Captain Halkett was very big in his games, by organizing a well-organised defence huge, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall with seven eyes.
However, Rangers had a lack of inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at certain moments under Gerard, there was a lack of good standards at the same time.
Their last chance with the ball wasn't good - once they managed to eliminate the team's defense that was playing in its own yard - and it's a sign to Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the class.
Erdogan received different reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) there were people arriving and seven weeks later as the Turkish and German leaders met for the college in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - with a view to maintaining relations between NATO allies.
They did not agree on issues including human rights, freedom of print and Turkey's EU entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police have quoted security reasons to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from being gathered before the mosque, but many people who support it face close to seeing their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators against Erdogan - many of them Kurdi - also blamed them, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to settle in the country.
The protests against each other reflect the separation of a visitor who is a hero to certain Turks and is thought to be ‘autocrat’ by others.
Road arrest in Deptford: Cyclists die in connection with a car
A ciclist died in a prison that involved a car in London.
The gate came close to the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic route in Deptford, in the vicinity of the city, for the gate at 10:15 BST.
The drivers stopped and waited for the paramedics, but the man died on the spot.
This prisoner occurred a few months after another cycle died after he hit a car and stayed in Children Street, about a distance from the prison last week.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the men and inform their neighbors.
Road closures and street car deviations are in force and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officials are being ordered in disorders
Six prison officials were imprisoned after a disturbance in high-security men's prisons, said the Prison Office.
The dispute began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire for the beginning of 09:30 BST on Friday and is still going on.
Specialized officials "Tornado" have entered to address the disorder, involving eight prisoners and located in one of the sections.
Officials were treated for minor injuries on their face.
Prison Service spokesmen said: "A specially trained prison staff has been shot to address an incident that is still going on in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for corrections.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may fall more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous victims in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being arrested by a prisoner.
And in October of the other year, anti-reflective officials were called to prison to address a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked by the ‘pool’ balen.
Uragan Rosa Threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City by Malajr Lake (Nixfa Areas Can Benefit)
It is rare that tropical depression will strike Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week as the remaining energy of Uragan Rosa goes from the desert area, leading to rapid flooding risks.
The National Time Service has already established a watch for rapid flooding for the Second and Third to West Arizona to the South and East of Nevada, California of Xlok and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to cross a straight line from over Phoenix on Wednesday, and then round both of them in a row.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in tweets that "only ten tropical cycles have maintained the status of tropical storms or depression at 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950"!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of 40 miles from the border of AZ."
The last models of the National Centre of Urangan are based on 2 to 4 inches of tea, with amounts isolated up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other desert area areas including central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to have from inches to 2 inches, with all possible isolates up to 4 inches.
For those who are at risk of rapid flooding, Rosa’s rent can be a positive thing because the region is affected by drought.
Although rain is a very serious issue, a few of these gains are likely to be beneficial because the Lbic side is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the device monitoring noise, slightly more than 40 per cent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme noise, the second highest category," they reported from weather.com.
First, the route of Uragan Rosa leads to the arrival of the Mexican Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, who will still be very strong hurricanes in the morning with maximum trees of 85 miles per hour, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and will go to the 12-mile walkway.
The maltempa is meeting with hoter waters in the Pacific and therefore powered.
Thus, it is expected to come to Mexico with the power of tropical malt in the morning after noon or early evening.
Buying in parts of Mexico can be strong, and this creates a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 pulses are expected from Baja California to the capital of Sonora, with a possibility of not more than 10 pulses," they reported from weather.com.
Then Rosa will go to the mountains around Mexico as a tropical nightmare before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of the morning of Wednesday as a tropical depression, and then go from Arizona and south of Utah until late Wednesday morning.
"The main danger expected by Rosa or her remnants is a very strong earthquake in Baja California, in the capital of Sonora, and in the desert of the U.S. lbe," said the National Centre of Uranians.
This chain is expected to produce rapid life-threatening flooding and flooding flows in the deserts, and valley in mountain terrain.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: Four arrests after Qtil
Three adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of killing after finding a 16-year-old adolescent child with sexually transmitted diseases in Somerset.
The adolescent children were found at Excelsior Terrace in the Midsomer Norton area, for the beginning of 04:00 BST on Saturday.
No hospital where it remains under "stable".
17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in Radstock area, Avon, said Somerset Police.
Officials have called for anyone who can have any films collected from the mobile phone of what happened to speak.
Trump said that Kavanaugh ‘sends the black and angry’ of the Democratic Party
"Volt for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said during a demonstration in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh ‘sends the blackness and anger’ of the Democratic Party during the process of its name.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Friday, with the strength and emotion of an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he attacked her sexually decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed during the meeting on its allegation.
On Saturday, the President said that the "American people saw the bravery and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"Volt to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of the most legal opinions ever made, a lawyer with a record of public service implicable," he said to the West Virginia party page.
The President referred indirectly to the name of Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our life.
Minix doesn't answer, but in fact, I am answering," he said.
"That's why we're all fighting for very good candidates."
Trump argues that Democrats have a mission to "resist and resist."
The first main procedural vote within the Senate on the name of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than a month later, said a senior GOP management assistant to CNN.
Hundreds were killed by the Indonesian territory, by tsunamis, with the number of deaths that appear to be increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many carried as much as a huge wave fell on the bays, after a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Sunday when a height of up to six metres (18 feet) fell strong on the ground when it started to rain, while many got up and died and everything was broken in the middle.
The tsunamis occur after a 7.5 power earthquake.
"When the threat of winter tsunamis emerged, people were still carrying out their activities on the shores and did not wake up to take immediate action and hit victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said, the words to the Indonesian agency for mitigating BNPB disasters during briefing in Jakarta.
"Tunami did not face alone, brought cars, zukk, homes, all the mud that was on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunamis had traveled along the open sea at 800 kph speeds (497 mph) before the fall.
Some people went down the stairs to get out of the tsunami and stay alive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs from the disaster agency have shown many buildings and broken doors, bridges surrounding them and down and moskea surrounded by water.
Strong coasts continued to leave the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes is felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in the statement that the energy released from the massive weekly earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima in World War II.
He said that the city's geography, which is located at the edge of a long and narrow bay, could increase the size of tsunamis.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centres and clinics had fallen.
The animals of some victims were found trapped under the roof of the fallen building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still injured.
Nugroho said that the damages and damages could be greater along the cost of 300 km (190 km) to the mountain of Palu, a area called Doghea, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communications "were completely sent and without information" by Doghea, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their personnel and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already tragedy, but it can go worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was highly criticised because it was not informed that they had met Paul, although official said that the mayor had arrived at the time of the warning.
In a social media-sharing video, a man on the top floor of a building can be expected to heed warnings with concern for tsunamis approaching people on the street below.
In a few minutes a huge amount of water dropped by force on the roof, and carried with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authenticate the films immediately.
The earthquake and tsunamis caused a strong drop in light which reduced communications around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The authorities said that the military began to send freight aircraft with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations still need other basic food and needs.
The city airport is only reopened for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
It was planned that President Joko Widodo would visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Friday.
The number of deaths exceeds 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While World Vision's staff from Dothraa came strong and full in the city of Palu, where employees were being shot into swordsmen's tarpolins armed in their office yards, they passed from where some sort of destruction occurred on the road there, said Mr. Doseba.
He said, "It's like they've seen a lot of houses we've lost."
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups began the unpleasant process of disaster aid, few of them complained about the fact that foreign aid workers with deep competence were not allowed to travel to Paul.
According to the Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff outside the country can only begin if the disaster site is declared as a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"I still have a state-of-the-art disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can introduce international assistance but so far there is no status."
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunamis of the Week, the friends and family of those who were still poor were still hoping their loved ones were the miracles to discover this story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they went out of a small baby in a drain.
On Friday, people who performed rescue were free women who had been arrested under the cloak for two days under her mother's body.
Gendon Subbandono, the leader of the Indonesian national team of Paragliding, was two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of those arrested in Lukana Roa Roa Roa, including Mr Mandige, were his students.
"As a superior person in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional weight," he said.
Mr Gendon reported how, in the hours following the news that the Lukana Roa Roa Roa circulated among the paragliding community, he was sent in a way, dissembled, messages with WhatsApp to the Palu competitors, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, only marked their departure, but did not indicate their arrival.
"I think that means that the messages haven't arrived," he said.
Allelelin takes $26,750 while ATM was refilled in Newport on the Level

Kanye West: The rap cantant changed its name to Ye
The song of the Kanye West rap is changing its name - for Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he said: "The man who was previously known as Kanye West"
West, 41, was held Ye for some time and used the monarch as the title for his eight album, which appeared in June.
The change takes place before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
It takes the song Ariana Grande on the program that has been canceled for "emotional reasons," said the programme's creator.
Besides that it is abbreviation of its current professional name, West said that the word has a religious meaning for it.
"Believe that 'ye' is the most word used in the Bible, and in the Bible means 'int'," said West earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with the representative of the Big Boy radio.
"Allora me, you, me we, she, we.
From Kanye that means 'one only', for Ye only - simply reflection of what we have good, bad, what motivates us, everything.
The album is more reflection of who we are."
It is one of the number of famous rap singers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year news that prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
As one co-operating with West, JAY-Z, also ends with or without ring and capital letters.
AMLO of Mexico promises that non-use of military against civilian persons
The elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military force against civilians as the country nears the 50th anniversary of direct
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "a sword will not use the military to restrict the Mexican people."
The troops survived a peaceful demonstration on 2 October 1968, and killed about 300 people at a time when left students movements were being established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by offering grants each month to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities would lead young people to criminal groups.
The United States shall double the funds for I.A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research expenditure in this area, says the investor and IA Kai-Fu Lee practitioners, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the U.S. government made IA opinions, even if there is no formal IA strategy in the United States.
However, China introduced its plan next year: it is aiming to be the first in IA innovation by 2030.
"Dublining the IA budget for research will be a good start, as all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next revolutionary step in the IA," Lee said.
The duplication of funds may double the chances that the next major IA will be held in the United States, Lee told CNBC in a week's interview.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent IA companies in China, Face+.
In the last eight years at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that won the top American Othello award, and then was executive with Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch in China.
Lee has recognised previous US government competitions in technology such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Agency and wondered when it will be next, in order to help identify the next vision.
Lee said that researchers in the United States often have to work hard to take government grants.
Lee said, "It's not China that is removing academic leaders; corporations are doing this."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have employed people who inspire others from universities to work on IA.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen their efforts in IA.
He said, "I believe that the black paper should be offered automatically to people who have Doctorate in IA."
The State Council of China issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funds to people in similar academic institutions as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations issue money to U.S. researchers, but academic work quality is lower in China.
More than a year later, the U.S. Defence Department established a Joint Centre of Artificial Intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academics, and White House announced the formation of an Chosen Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And that month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million per year in IA research.
However, the legislation of the United States that has tried to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen any action within a few months.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed;
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum yesterday on whether it should change its name to "Republic of the Republic of Macedonia", a step that resolves to dispute with Greece that has been blocked by its offers of partnership for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province known as Macedonia, supports that the name of the village in its mountains represents a possibility of taking possession of its territory and has made a vote on its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but national opponents argued that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the Macedonian majority’s population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether participation would reach a minimum of 50 per cent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote is read: "You favour NATO and the EU with agreement with Greece."
Those who support the change in name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to enter into bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries which have been trained by the Yugoslavian class.
"I have come today to vote for the country's future, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the European Union's umbrella because it means a safer life for all of us," Olivera Georgievska said, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change in name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State electoral commission said that there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of the registered voters disappeared.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, voter in the capitals, Skopje.
The Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, wife Zorica and son of Dushko, attended the Macedonian referendum on the change in the name of the country which gives it the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was building a small park and preparing seats in front of the young armed men who will make a referendum note.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we need to enter with great dignity under our conditions, not with another command," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can serve others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says the association in NATO will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the majority will be in favour of more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said that a result in favour of the change of name would be "a confirmation of our future."
A published study published by the 2nd Institute for Macedonian Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would take part in the referendum - an amount under the necessary participation.
Another survey, carried out by the Macedonian TV Telema, found that 57 per cent of respondents are planning to wake up tomorrow.
Of those, 70 percent said they would.
In order to make the referendum successful, participation shall be 50 per cent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, this is the first serious moment to government policy in favour of Western ideologies since it took control of its hands in May of the next year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City's player, passes from all Brighton's defense to 'goal'
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defense at Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his 'goal' in 65 minutes seem very easy.
The attacker from Argentina received a half-grawd balloon at the beginning of the sequence.
A race of three Brighton defenders before a fight into an open space.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players with black spots.
Fight against one former defender before much more than the end of Brighton's box.
Then split the balloon on his left and found Sterling.
The English attacker put the ball for the first time in the box to re-share Aguero, which uses the left-hand side to insert the ball into the right-hand side of the ball by passing it from where Brighton Matthew Ryan's goalkeeper.
"Aguero is putting some problems in his pocket," said City Pep Guardiola's coke to journalists.
"We talked about the fact that he was gonna play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We had the good courts that made 'goal' at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the fight against Prime Minister League.
That 'goal' occurs in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the balloon in very deep within the territory of Brighton in that action.
You sent the balloon right to Leroy Sane on the left side very happily.
Sane missed the balloon a little before he brought Sterling where the pasta.
The ISky Blues attacker put the balloon a little bit and put it in the hole just before it ran into an unsubstantiated territory.
City will play against Hoffenheim at the season of the Champions League groups at 122:55 p.m. on Wednesday in Rehein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer has to play in Spoiler vs. Rockies
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the possibility of competing in the decisive game, there was no reason to make an effort to start again.
But the player so competitive Scherzer hopes that he may be the 'picher' on Thursday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive game, which is ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West with one game.
The Rockies managed to get them an opportunity to continue compete with 5-2 win against the Nationals this evening, but they are still trying to win the first title of the division.
"Although we are playing for nothing, at least we can have the possibility to win by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with leaves and the other team is likely to be playing at the highest level of any point we can face this year.
What must not compete in those circumstances?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start tomorrow, but they are allegably inclined to let Scherzer be the 'picher' in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start for 34 times, had a practice session on Friday and will be playing as a painter on Friday when he is usually crying.
The player from Washington playing leminia hands is 18-7 with ERA of 2.53 and 300 'strikeout' in 220 2/3 'innings' at this stage.
Shows of Trump in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation relating to the election of his Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"In November, everything we have done will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of our most important choices in life.
This is very big -- Minix we're arguing, but in fact, we're arguing that we're all fighting for very good candidates," he said.
"We have seen this very horrible and radical group of Democrats, we are seeing it happen now," Trump continued.
And they are determined to take back the power by using any means possible, you can see the black.
It does not burden them with who they are, who must fly to get power and control, what they want, power and control, we will not give them."
He said that Democrats have a mission to "resist and resist."
"And I've seen this over the past four days," he said, and was calling the Democrats "rejective and angry and disgruntled and dissolute."
He referred to the Democratic Senator classified in the Senate Judiciary Committee, named Diane Feinstein, and received a very negative response from the audience.
"The r-response?
Have you read the document?
Uh, uh, that's it.
No, uh, we're waiting, the first -- her body movements were nothing positive -- the worst moves I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a large group.
Not tolerating who communicates his opinions
When Momentum activists in my local party tried to censor me, it did not work much.
After all, I am the most recent MP in a list of MPs of the Labour Party that were not positively gathered - because we shared our opinions.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because he fought against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of a censor is critical because I disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, similar issues to those on which Jeremy did not meet the previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting last week stated that "I want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the majority of my eight years as a local laborist MP, the meetings of the General Council last night were exactly that.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the political commitment "more noble and generous" that you have quoted if, in fact, you have never really started in the truth.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged whether it is acceptable for the party's management.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar political understanding began to expect to change agreements and take positions that we had never agreed with in other situations - both on national security and on the EU's single market.
Every time we speak publicly - and, in fact, does not make any difference - follow up on social media abuse with a request to remove my MP's role, denouncing central policy, and saying that you do not have a part of the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Yes, I know I had the best doors over some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to them tend to be political.
It aims at professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who daily face a lot of sexual or racist abuse but never hide it from comments.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this policy area is the fact that abuse levels have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should show a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that no longer that large group and with any "independence" movement or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes a party.
I have been given much advice over the last two years that encouraged me to keep my opinions to myself, not to be so vocal and then "be good."
But I did not get involved in politics to do so.
Since I entered the Laburista Party 32 years ago as a student of the school, I have been tempted by the neglect of the government of Thatcher who left my comprehensive school class literally in a catastrophic state, in order to improve public services for those who need most - whether as local councillor or as government minister.
I never took my policy, even in the past election.
No one in Nottingham East could in some way have been confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
For those who promoted the movement last week, all I say is that when the country is moving towards Brexit which will harm our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to devote my time and energy to my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have to not for Nottingham Momentum is for my constituents, whether members of the Laburista Party or not: I am proud to work for you and I assure you that no amount of threat to you from my job or political exile does not discourage me from acting in those who believe that they are all your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, which have not yet been released, are on net in class
Two attempts could change the result a little, but there was no doubt that Ayr was trying to win this very exciting day game of the Tennt's Premiership.
As is now the first in the class, the only team of all ten who have not ever disappeared.
Finally, it was the superior defense, as well as their capacity to benefit from the opportunities, which helped the team, who was playing in its own garden, winning, and the poet Peter Murchie had every right to be content.
"We have endured trials during our games to this day, and we are not satisfied yet, so we are content," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "We gave credit to Ayr, they benefited from better opportunities than I did."
With Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Climo, Ayr, they were inviting, but, rather, a letter from the head of Iskosia Rory Hughes, who lets play the game from the Warriors, gave Melrose the opportunity to try and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended the win of Ayr with 'penalty', previously, in the middle of the exact game, made 'goal' and an individual attempt to turn points into 17-5 for Ayr in the race.
But Melrose started the second part of the good game and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the score by 5 points.
Then he stopped the game because of a serious corruption of Ruairhyh Knott, who came out of the crowd on the striker, and when he again started the game, Ayr continued to close the points after an attempt by Staffford McDowell, converted by Climo.
Then, Ayr Blair Macpherson's chief agent was given a sacrilege, and for another time, Melrose emerged aggressively when they made an attempt not converted by Bruce Colvine, after a period of severe pressure.
However, the team that was playing in its own garden began to attack again, and when a Struan Hutchinson letter was given for action that hit on Climo without the balloon, from the 'penalty' line, MacPherson put the balloon on the ground behind the Ayr group that was moving forward.
Climo turned, as did not do for another time almost from the area from which the game begins again, after Kyle Rowe picked up the ball that David Armstrong met from the box and sent to Gregor Henry, who was playing side by side, for the five attempts of the side he was playing in his own field.
The personality of Still Game appears to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The personality of Still Game Ford Kieran appears to be ready to enter the hospital industry after it has been discovered that it has been mentioned as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man who makes Jack Jarvis's part on the BBC's popular program, which he writes and shares with his girlfriend for a long time Greg Hemphil.
The next nine series will be the last of the programme, and Kiernan seems to be planning for life after Craiglang.
According to the lists of official registers, he is the Director of Aposimorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun was looking for Kiernan to engage in the "very good-looking restaurant trade" of Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes that the courts will open a way back to the Pacific
The sea is guarded by the general navigal quarters armed with bows and chains in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag along the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are
What we're looking for is a duty."
Around all Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the cost lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of the 19th century's resources is still clear - as the wish for Bolivians to sail into the Pacific Ocean for another time.
That hope may be at its highest in decades, as Bolivia expects a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October following five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and obviously awaits the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the CIG on a large screen across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will find, in favour of Bolivia's declaration, which - after decades of irregular work - Chile is obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia a sovereignty over the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Indian president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial battle for his election again last year - also has much to lose in the decision on Monday.
"It is very close that we have access to the Pacific Ocean again," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia - and that it would change little if it did.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant the territory of Chile, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible operations.
Only six months after the final arguments were heard, the GOC's judgment indicates that the case "was not complicated" said Paz Zárate, an expert from Chile in international law.
And the distance from favouring the cause of Bolivia, the last four years they could not have been of assistance.
"The issue of access to the sea is taken from the administration of current Bolivia," Zárate said.
The Austrian rhetoric of Morales has weakened any remaining Chilean advance, it has been suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will, at some point, continue to speak, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries did not become ambassadors since 1962.
Ex-President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, welcomed the idea that the decision-making of the court was unusual.
On Tuesday, Bolivia will have "a unique opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and "the opportunity to "complete 139 years of agreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also pointed out that Morales - one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - was using the maritime issue as a political aid.
"Bolivia will never relinquish its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not be carried out unless it can be trusted by the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons is the first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to fulfil the commitments made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
Its comments are made as the United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to have arrived to relaunch the nuclear diplomacy that is more than three months behind Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
It is said that it is "in vain" that the continued sanctions and the US objection to a declaration ending the Korean Government will never cause Korea to go beyond.
Washington is concerned whether it should agree with the statement without Pyongyang taking the first significant step of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want the second summit.
But there is widespread xetticism that Pyongyang is serious that the country is probably the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit of Kim-Turp.
The mirrors of the Paris fashion reveal the latest collection of massive hair shirts that will appear in the main garments.
If you want to add to the collection of your thumbs or completely cover the sun, you can stop searching.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a wide range of stranded and very large hair clothing for their 2019 Spring and Sajf collection on the runway that set the style in Paris Fashion Week.
A very practical puzzle is very visible on Instagram this summer and these designers have won their amazing creations on the stage.
The object most striking from Valentino was an extravagant beige capppellets visited with a wide range of roots that completely covered the soil of the models.
Other large-scale accessories included sunflowers, health hats and even pineapple - but are not designed to keep warm roots.
Tom Browne also discovered a choice of foreign masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had the paired hats and were more attractive to Hannibal Lecter than ‘high texture’.
One creature was seeing the device of his fingers full of snorkels and goggles, while another was like a bunch of twisted needles.
And if you continue with this good-orthic style.
Those who follow the fashion assume that huge 'bonnets' will appear in the main tools.
The very large capillary emerges after the release of 'La Bomba', the head of the bee with a large pair of two feet that were lit from everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The ‘cult label’ responsible for the hat that did not practice anything that appeared very much on the social media gained another great creation on the stage – baby basketball containing almost the size of the cheap model she was driving.
The skirmish orangio orange basket, surrounded by small spaghetti and white skin cap, was the most spectacular creation in the 2019 Jacquemus collection in Paris Fashion Week.
Famous Stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'We expect to see great sea turtles and bassks in the main nets for the next winter - because the designer has made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to trace the demand for very large accessories.'
John Edward: Skills in Essential Languages for Global Citizens
The independent school of Scotland maintains a record of academic excellence, and these continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in the sport, art, music and other Community activities.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), make themselves available to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent scales aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain subject to popular and desired choice in school.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak a man in a language that he understands, he understands.
If he speaks with his own tongue, he understands with his own heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the recent studies this year, we can see that languages are in progress in the classification tables with the highest rates of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages achieved a higher degree.
The data, collected from 74 schools that are members of SCIS, showed that 72 per cent of students obtained A Higher in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also obtained A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly need children and young people in the future.
Languages are now, as an option of a subject, being kept in the same relation as STEM topics (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the courses of independent schools and other boys.
A survey by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that, for reasons that employers had given up on the fact that they were being sent to fill out job vacancies, 17 per cent had been attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, linguistic skills are becoming more and more imperative to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career one chooses, if you learn another language, this will have a real advantage in the future because it has the ability to live such a long time.
To be able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically put a multilingual person ahead of competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak well enough foreign languages to hold a conversation and 15 per cent were French the only language spoken by two numbers.
It is therefore that investment in language learning is now important for children today.
To know more than one language, especially those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will learn different languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered most important to the United Kingdom when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages that they can choose from in the independent school, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Independent Scottish schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future.
In a global business environment, language remains very important for the country's future, and this should therefore be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered as "artificials of international communication."
Independent scales will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Tomorrow Red LeBron will play for the first time with Lakers in San Diego
LeBron James' sports parties do not have much to expect him to start for the first time for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers' coke Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game before the season begins tomorrow against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the amount of minutes to play will still have to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell wrote that James is likely to play a limited amount of minutes.
After the previous practice session last week, James was asked about his plans for the six pre-games show not starting the Lakers season.
"F" this stage of my career doesn't need games before the season to prepare myself," he said.
Turnover manifesto in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a rehearsal of the evening campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first five-week trip event, including stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote of confirmation suspended for its option to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump is aiming to build support for the next half-term elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when votes are cast in Nov.
In time it is the demonstration of Trump in West Virginia night and how does it look online?
The Trump event in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET night, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the demonstration of Trump in West Virginia online here by direct broadcast on YouTube.
This week's hearings are likely to address the nomination of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, which has been intense because of allegations of sexual misconduct by an advance confirmation vote of the Senate suspended for a week while investigating the FBI.
But the primary objective of this series of demonstrations is to help the Republicans face the November elections to get a little moment.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that these five demonstrations last week are aimed at "give energy to volunteers and participants as the Republicans try to protect and distribute the majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important for this agenda that the president will travel to as far as possible as possible to the stage of the campaign," Reuters told us about the campaign of Trump that he called his name.
Sketched for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the night's demonstration can collect participants from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract cover from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
The week will be the second time last month that Trump will be a spring West Virginia, the state won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate of the West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, who is in charge of the investigation.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to inspire him in the investigation," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
The Ryder Tax 2018: The U.S. U.S. Team determined not to kill their hearts while returning to the Union's singles
After three sessions on one side, the Forums of the Last Week could have been precisely what this Ryder Tax is needed.
The bandling pendulum is a fully developed sport concept but one that players really believe in, and never more than in such competitions.
So where do they say the moment is now?
"These were in front of six points and now they're in four, so I think they're carrying this as a little moment," Jordan Spieth said as he walked through the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points forward with twelve others being played.
The Americans, say Spieth, feel but have a bit of wits and have a lot of encouragement to them, not at least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each one opens with three points from four.
Spieth was accurate from tea to green and is walking by example.
That love from the heart of celebration continued to grow as it continued its round, by making a crucial hole to bring the fourth game as large as it is and Thomas were two from below two.
His poem that won the game on 15 was met by a similar wave, the kind that tells you to believe that the American team is still there.
"See you have to go in deep and worry about your own party," Spieth said.
That's what each of these players left now.
18 cuts to make a mark.
The only players with more points from Spieth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the uncontestable story of Tazza Ryder.
The foreign but free couple of Europe are four and are considered perfect.
"Moliwood" were the only couple who didn't hide bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Sunday afternoon and after Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to go both towards and from this living page, establish that they are players offering a challenge of the Hand, and there is no more popular player to signal a potential European win as the sun goes down on Le Golf National from Fleetwood or Molinari.
In particular, both immediately on different tracks.
But here I am talking about the European glory that is still ahead of it.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson quickly released by Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four-balls, when he compared with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the front deck entered Spain and Sweden into a cave that never succeeded in getting close to them to get out of it.
But the Haad, there is no one to help you get out of your bed.
Fourballs and forums are very encouraging to see them closely due to the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and the way a strategy can be changed in seconds.
Europe played better as a team so far and is ahead of the final day but this forum session has also shown that the United States team is determined that some, especially from the United States, were doubting.
Europe forward with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Tax
Europe will take a good advantage on the final day of the Ryder Taza after leaving the Fourballs and Seven Weeks ahead with 10-6 on the United States.
The inspired couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made the effort with two gains on Tiger Woods that found it difficult to take their point so far in Le Golf National for four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, prepared to keep the trophies that died in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American side that was badly damaged in the morning's fourballs, which took the series with 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance to forums by winning two parties, but they could not reach a difference in score.
The side of Jim Furyk needed eight points from the 12th game of one Haad player to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first new European for the stage to win four points after each other while he and Molinari, named "Mollwood" after the sesensional weekend are only the second couple who have won four points from the four parts of their opening in the story of the Ryder Tazza.
After dominating on Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs then worked excellently to welcome Woods that did not appear optimum and the new American player for the Bryson Dechambeau season with even more empathy score of 57.4.
Woods, who found difficulty in the two parties on the Week, showed occasional moments of brightness but now lost 19 of its 29 parties in the forums and forums and seven after each other.
Justin Rose, a light for tomorrow's fourballs, returned to his friend Henrik Stenson in the forums for the loss of 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - which are ranked first and third in the world.
But it didn't go as far as Europe came on a good day, with a few whites in the Paris Peninsula.
Jordan Spieth, a great winner for three times, and Justin Thomas set the limit for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They gained a brave victory of 2&1 on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and later returned to Poulter and Rory McIllroy with 4&3 in the foursomes after the two openings were lost.
It was only two times in the story of the Ryder Tazza which brought us back from a difference of four points while it came into the singles, although the holders of the Furyk side need to draw to keep the trophies.
However, after they were the second best for two days, the House contract seems to be more than they can do.
North Korea says "no way" will be unilaterally disarmed without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations the Seventh that continued sanctions were extending its lack of confidence in the United States and that there was no way that the country would unilaterally leave its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "relevant good will measures" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, closed the nuclear test site, and promised that it would not promote nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen a corresponding answer from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances in no way will we disappoint ourselves first unilaterally."
While Ri repeated family complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phase" approach to denuclearisation in which North Korea was preferred as a step by step, its statement showed significantly that it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation without considering how Pyongyang had done in the past.
It refers to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in the first summary that has never been made between the US President serving his duties and leader of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promises to work towards the "nuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promises to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea was seeking a formal end to the Korean Government in 1950-53, but the United States said that Pyongyang first had to surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls for the reduction of severe international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "first denuclearisation" and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their objective in a coherent manner, and also a challenge to "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can break us is a dream of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are deepening our lack of confidence."
These are not plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that US leaders highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in last five months and added: "If the part of this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have led to such a blockage."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the mainland land of the United States with North Korea rockets was inevitable after the "Mr. Kattiv" Trump called Kim "rokits man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, last year threatened to "completely read" North Korea, urged Kim to take steps to disarm, but said that there was still much work to be done and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea denuclearizes.
Wednesday, Trump said there was no time schedule for this, saying, "If you take two years, three years or five months - don't make a difference."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should lend Pyongyang to the steps taken.
However, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Friday, told the UN Security Council that: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council shall continue in force and without delay until we realize the fully and finalized denuclearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened the sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with a view to suspending funding for the nuclear and ballistic missiles of Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Ri at the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but its last visit has not been well.
He left Pyongyang in July while he said that progress was made, after Korea in a few hours criticized North Korea for making "a gangster's likes".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to disarm a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "relevant measures".
He said Kim had said that the "relevant measures" he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on the use of waste enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has succeeded in making all its students who have not yet graduated to fight the macho culture that is growing to study all night and remain healthy with caffeine.
Academic found that students at the university at first place in the world often have no idea of the basics about how they think themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist in the Brigham and Female Hospital, drew up the course, which believes he is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving talks on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"Last time she was raised up and said, "Why are you telling me this now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping--that surprises," she told The Telegraph.
The course, which began for the first time this year, explains to students the essential things about how good sleep traditions help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding out that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
An hour-long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a room where students sleep, where students click on coffee, porters, trainers and books to relieve them of the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance has an effect on sleep weakness, and the importance of sleep time routine.
In another section, participants are born as long-term sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it will not change students' behavior from the first.
But we believe that they have the right to know - as long as you have the right to know the effects on health when you choose to smoke cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture that is proud that "you've been able to stay up all night studying" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep was a growing problem.
To ensure that it falls sufficiently, and of good quality, must be the "secret weapon" of a student to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, it is also said to avoid increasing weight, as the lack of sleep puts the mind in a fashion of hunger, which makes them all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler draw up the course, after waiting one of his classes for the last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to insist on a course throughout the camp.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students who graduated to conduct a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider alerting when they go to bed, as well as when they wake up, and know about the effects of "blue light" damage arising from electronic screens and LED light, which can balance your circular rhythm, and lead to problems of falling.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal leaves Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another period of fatigue when they played outside their country as Dolly Menga's strategists delivered Steven Gerrard's fertile side for 1-0 losses in Livingstone.
The side of Ibrox was seeking to record their first victory while traveling from the 3rd triumph of February 4-1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Hold’s second losses in the 18th party as manager to leave his side eight points away from the great leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Mega scored seven minutes before the half-time and Rangers' list of players missing from the inspiration never appeared to have been taken.
While Rangers are now taken to the sixth place, Livingston falls to the third and only after Hibernian on a difference of angle.
And there may be more concerns for Rangers after the Calum Spence lineman had to be treated for rats in a race after apparently shooting an item by the team's players who played outside his country.
Gerard made eight changes in the way he passed from Ayr to the Betfred Tazza terminal.
On the other hand, Holt, met with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and was pleased in the way his well-trained form prevented their opponents from continuing.
Rangers could dominate the possessions but Livingston did more with the balloon they had.
They were only to score two minutes from the start when Menga's first play-off sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's gowl but the midfielder took his great chance.
Free-kick with Keaghan Jacobs' strength then found shipper Craig Halkett but his loyal friend Alan Lithgow could only get out of the back.
Rangers got control but it seemed there was more hope than belief in their game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had to have a penalty on the mark for five minutes as he and Steven Lawless were arrested but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the summons of the Communist.
Rangers succeeded in targeting only two courts in the first half of the party but the former Goalkeeper of Ibrox Liam Kelly, although they were concerned about Lassana Coulibary's race density and Ovie Ejaria's light strands.
While the first goal of Livi in 34 minutes was when the other team was playing better, no one could deny that they were only held for their efforts.
For another time, Rangers failed to manage Jacobs' good piece of business.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher joined the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga to take action.
Gerard responded to the bridge by changing Coulibally with Ryan Kent and the change almost provided an immediate impact as the Winger gathered in Morelos but the impressionary came from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to play exactly the type of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett who played a long ball after a long ball in the long run.
The side of Holt could extend their position forward in the final stages but McGregor kept a good hold of Jacobs before Lithgow entered the opening from the crown.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton had another late request for penilty as he argued with Jacobs but for another time Thomson looked at the other side.
Almanac: The inventor of Geiger's Computor
And now from our German page of "Sunday Morning": 30 September, 1882, as today 136 years old, and WE HAVE DESTROYED ... the day in which future physics Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, invention which eventually led to the device known as Geiger's Computor.
Since then, Geiger's Computor has also been a pop culture pedation, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," which shows those unlikely cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
A man: "What's the douche bag?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you meet these challenges, you can actually hear the effects of atoms that give radioactivity in minerals."

New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "tear" cells with unusual behaviour
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "tear" cells with unusual behaviour and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cells with unusual behaviour as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells by a patient, which are transformed into a laboratory
These may then "have" common protein for many cancers and then be re-injected
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
Not treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise cells with unusual behaviour, has seen the cancer of its ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of the immune cells by a patient, they are changed into the laboratory so that they can "see" common protein for many cancers called HER2, then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "exploites the growth of various types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovaries, lung and colorectal cancer, explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the taking of immune cells from patients and how to "learn" how cancer cells work in the treatment of type of leukaemia.
Kanye West made a Verbal Attack in favour of Trump, While it was a MaGA Beritta liebes, After its appearance on SNL.
Dan Ma Marx Tajjeb
Kanye West was started in the studies during Saturday Night Live after a confusion performance in which US President Donald Trump said he would go out for the election in 2020.
After singing his third night song, called Ghost Town where there was a generation of Mace America Great, he began to say against the Democrats and held his support for Trump.
"Many times I tell a white person and say, "How can you please Trump, that racist?"
If I had an account on racism, I had met from America," he said.
The SNL launched the program with a comedy sketch containing Matt Damon’s appearance in which Hollywood’s style reconnaissance of Brett Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate’s Judicial Committee on sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not spreading, the West video has been posted on the social media by Committee Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock was trying to hit you with the West when he took his position.
In addition, West had complained to the audience who had joined him after the Friday about his birth.
"I wake up after the fifth.
He said, "Don't go out there with that beer."
Get out of here!
Then they say it's gone," said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the dead? And he continues to say that he would be "I wish my superman's head, because this means you can't tell me what we're doing.
They tried with love."
Its comments fired at least two times by hearings and SNL box members appeared embarassed, reported Variety, with one person there who told the publication: "In all studies there has been a great silence."
West brought as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend had, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
The West is very confused with the performance of the I Love brochure, lips as a Perrier bottle.
West had the support of the president of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the most courageous spirits: GRAZES OF TIEQAF TO FOLLA."
But presentationer Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply "what he is and this is something nice less."
"But I DID NOT choose to lend someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art") who believes that he is working and spreading a ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
We're another talent," she added.
Before the program, the rapper reported on Twitter that had changed his name, saying that it was now "what was previously known as Kanye West."
Not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Didy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
The previous rapper, Snoop Dog had the name Snoop Lion and of course the legacy of music that no longer accompanied Prince, changed its name to a symbol after the artist who previously was known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Kit Harington Island talks about toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role in attracting the hat as Jon Snow in the series of violent average fantasy of HBO Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31 years old, spoke about the macho steroid, saying that such roles on the screen often mean that young people feel they need to be treated with dignity.
While speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and had doubts about how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also admitted that he has "strong interests" to address the issue.
"Personally, I feel that I have a strong interest, now--where did we die badly with masculinity?" he said.
"What were we teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we have now?"
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through its very masculinity.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What should be taught on TV, and on the streets, making young people feel that they must be this certain side of a man?
I think this is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change this?
Because it is very clear that something went wrong for the youth."
In the interview it is also accepted that it will not make prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones when the series ends next winter, saying "so wind and sail".
From November Kit will appear in the new production of True West of Sam Shepard which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is free.
Recently the actor discovered that when he met Rose's wife, he was the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I am stuck with Marti on this program, so this way I give my future family, and live from here forward," he said.
Rose interpreted the part of Ygrintte, the interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the series of fantasy he won in Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in the territory of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced a 14% drop in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, say health officials.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted by sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people taking HIV this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, one year later, the number of HIV and AIDS residents in China increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual HIV transmission is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men having sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases transmissions come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has discovered data from GOP senators, says "dangerous gideb" and "confofa theories"
The representative of the United States, Maxine Waters of the United States of America on Saturday announced allegations that a member of its staff posted the personal information of three United States senators on the page of Wikipedia of legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles confirmed that claims were being made by coins and websites on the "right-left side".
"Gideb, giraffe and more giraffes," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information issued in an annex included the home address and telephone numbers of the United States Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, the two of Utah.
The information appeared online on Friday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate board session on allegations of sexual misconduct against the nomination of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure took place some time after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the location source was associated with the Waters office and released information from a member of Waters staff, reported the Hill.
"This baseless allegation is completely false and absolutely wrong," Waters continued.
"My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and false allegations - was in no way responsible for revealing this information.
This baseless allegation is completely false and absolutely false."
The statement of Waters quickly received online criticism, including by the former White House Ari Fleisher's printer secretary.
"This is one of the angers," Fleisher wrote.
"This suggests that it does not have the time to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
It shall not be resistant.
The complainant’s reasons should not be confused.
It must be calm and quiet."
Fleisher appeared to be comparing the reaction of Waters to the criticism of the Kavanaugh Justice Democrats, which was accused of criticism that appeared to be too angry during the Friday meeting.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will come out to take Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also quoted on Twitter.
"This is something big if it's true," he said on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that its office was intended to "authorities and entities to enforce the appropriate law on these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the authors will be known," he continued, "and that they will be legally responsible to all their actions which are harmful and dangerous to everyone and to all my staff."
Critic of Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson, imitation of weak spy
It has now become traditional to look for Brexit's interpretations in any new film with a British perspective and this seems to apply to the return of the franchise of imitation of Johnny English’s girlfriend – who started back in 2003 with Johnny English and re-lived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
The ironic autosatire on the subject of how bad we obviously are, is it the chance of the country's new export?
At any rate, incompetence Johnny English with his large eyes and face parts moving out of the ordinary had the new license for the second time to do anything wrong - that name more than anything else shows that it is a wide-ranging comical creation designed for non-English-speaking territories of people.
Of course, it is the stupid secret agent who despite his foreign claims to his fair face has a little bit from Clouseau, Mr. Bean's murder and a large part of that man who contributed one note to the theme melody of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony in London.
It is also originally based on the traveler and the international mystery man who once Atkinson had played his part in Barclaycard TV commercials, today a mission, after leaving chaos behind.
There is a good moment or two in this last EU issue.
Answer me the moment Johnny English was on his way to an electrician while he was wearing medical courage clothes and drawings were tied to his water for a while.
Atkinson’s present for physical prostitution appears, but humorism seems rather poor and extreme, especially since the "series" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves offer prostitution as a confidential ingredient.
The humorism is felt as if it were aimed at children than for adults, and why Johnny English's other lucky incidents were not so inventive and as distorted as Atkinson's voiceless film in Bean's person.
The perennial topical proposal is now that Britain is in serious concern.
cybernetic hacker infiltrated the web network very secreted many British costs, by identifying the identities of all British agents in the field, to the employee's disability at work - fortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the crackdown on the cake for the prime minister who is an imperishable figure and with difficulties, who is already suffering from a full range of political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this character compared to Teresa May but there is not much in writing to work.
Her intelligence consultants inform her that every active spy has been compromised, it will have to bring someone withdrawn.
And this means Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in an elegant building, but gives non-official lessons about how to become an infiltrated operational: a little good luck here as English offers a school of Rock type costing.
English is taken back to Whitehall for emergency meetings and is reunited with his previous friend of great patience, Bough, interpreted again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, with a subtomarine commander, the role of one of the playwrights played by Vicki Pepperdine, where she is a little loose.
Therefore, the two inseparable who are always taking part in its Master’s Secret Service are back in action when they meet the character of seductive and beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletina interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
The prime minister, however, falls under the command of the billionaire of technology, claiming that it can solve the problems of Britain's computer: left-wing Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of fun fair behavior: libsin as wetters, fire a tall French restaurant, create chaos to climb on Volta's luxury jet; and English starts a full anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality covers to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
Certainly all stops lead to that last sequence, but friendly and animated as much as it is, has some idea of children's television.
Something rather moderate.
And like Johnny English's other films we can't think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes them his talent?
The labour refuses to prepare a plan for Britain to work for a week of four days but is paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Work Party is expected to consider a radical plan that will see Britain work for four days - but pay for five.
The party shall, on the one hand, require the teacher of companies to pass the remainder from the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them another free day.
This would show employees to enjoy for three days a week - but still take the same pay with them.
Source said that the idea would be "facilitating" with the party's agenda and economic plans for workers.
The four-day rounds for a week have been approved by the Conference of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
Superintendent of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "Mistennia announces a policy review before the end of the year.
"This will not happen from today but a week's work of four days is an inspiration that goes along with the party's approach to balance the economy in favour of the workers as well as the party's global industrial strategy."
The Labour Party shall not be the first to approve such an idea, with the Black Party which has promised a week of work of four days during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, the aspirations are currently not approved by the entire Labour Party as far as they are concerned.
A speech to the Labour Party said: "A week of work of four days is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
The Chancellor of Opposition John McDonnell used the last week's Labour conference to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power from "anonymous directors" and "those who benefit" in utility fingers.
The opposition Chancellor's plans also mean that current actors in water companies may not take their full share back as the Labour Government can "reduction" on the basis of perceived misconduct.
It has also confirmed plans to put workers on board companies and create Inclusive Own Funds to pay 10 per cent of the equity of private sector firms to employees, who are ready to take annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" if Kavanaugh's FBI investigation can change their understanding
The FBI's investigation of the case against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his name for the Supreme Court by week, and raised the question of whether the Bureau's findings could influence a Republican senator rather than withdraw his support.
In a broadcast interview, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could know something that could lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open to his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, and of course," said Kennedy.
"I said and went into the sitting, I said, I spoke to Dr. Kavanaugh.
Cemplify after this happened, after that allegation came out, I said, "Do you want it?"
It was a resolution, determined, inequivalent."
However, Graham’s vote seems difficult to change.
"I have already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and must be very charged," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I know this: Brett broke it up well," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And every person who does so cannot verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I didn't see anything new to change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Did Something to Eradicate Poverty?
The next week, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a very impressive list of styles that will appear and a much more impressive mission; ending world poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the real purpose of the event ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of representatives hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive an event-free ticket (as long as it is not ready to pay a VIP ticket), the concerters had a serious item of tasks, or "actions" such as voluntary letters to world leaders, making telephones or other significant ways to help them raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the 12-year-old Global Citizen managed to achieve its goal?
The idea that people are premised by an unfair concert is a genuine way to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism" - people feel that they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending tweets?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says that it has registered more than 19 million "actions" than those that support it, which has remained for a number of different objectives.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group estimated 390 commitments and announced its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been exhausted or collected.
The group considers that the safe funds have so far made a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the day.
A few of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the United Kingdom of committed investors and implementers to "help children grow for their full potential," with Rwanda providing $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments, and such Global Citizens, we can make the social injustice of the denture noted in the bottom of the page in history," The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the audience during a direct concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to invite the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In answer to one of the most common questions on his website that asks "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "Ser will be a long and hard journey--sometimes we will fall and fall.
But like the great movements of civil rights and anti-parity, we will succeed, because we have more power when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée are among some artists who will appear at this year's event in New York, who will present Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States uses the Naval Fleet for "block" to block Russian energy exports - Internal Secretariat
"If necessary," Washington can appeal to its Naval Fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's growth in Syria - especially, where it works at a legitimate government's request - is due to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason that is found in the Middle East is to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the South of Europe," he said allegedly.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of addressing this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Naval Fleet, to ensure that the maritime routes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy has not reached the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing those who were awaiting the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without a purpose of making themselves the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
It continues to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic choice over Iran and Russia is, little or too much, fuel burning and replacement," he said, referring to Russia as "one-powerful" with an economy dependent on fuel.
The following statements are because the Trump administration was on mission to strengthen its export of natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a much better choice for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to force Germany to issue from the "unsuitable" North Stream 2, which according to Trump, made Berlin the "silver" of Moscow.
Moscow has often achieved that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline of $11 billion, which is expected to double the existing gas pipeline capacity for 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington’s intense opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"We believe that energy cannot be a tool for the exercise of pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the Secretary of Energy of the United States Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, reaffirming its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of Germany for industry, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), invited the United States to stay away from European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Ser "Test Well" If You Don't Leave for President in 2020, Senator of Massachusetts says
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said the week would "examine well" if he did not go out to the president after the mid-term elections.
At a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he considered himself out.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and call our corrupt government and this includes a woman in the highest position," he said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, we will carefully examine whether we are going to go out to the president."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the council meeting, saying he was " taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," he said.
Warren was direct in his criticism of Trump and his name for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Last week, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a fifth study showed that most of Warren’s own constituents do not think they should issue for the election in 2020.
Twenty-five percent of Massachusetts' "probably" voters said that the senator should not go out for the election, according to a survey of the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Centre.
Two and thirty percent supported the election.
The survey showed more support for the issue of election by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting for potential election and 48 per cent against him.
Democratic names of another high profile that has been discussed with regard to a potential outlet for the 2020 election include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Starten said to decide officially by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin refers to the Track Palin PTSD in the Donald Trump demonstration
Track Palin, 26 years old, every year in Iraq after being registered in September
He was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence on Tuesday night
"What happened to my children, what happened to me after we returned, we can relate to other families who feel the ramifications of the PTSD and some of our soldiers return with them," said the audience in a demonstration to Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the obvious problem that no one is addressing" and said about her and other war veterans, "they return a little different, they return stronger, they return to think if there is no respect for what other soldiers like them and aircraft personnel, and every other military member, gave the country."
He was arrested both in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, while interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons while he was urban, according to Dan Bennett, I spoke to the Police Department of Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. support a challenge for new asylum policy
Eighty states and the Colombian District are supporting a legal challenge for a new U.S. asylum policy to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district, the Week presented a case of court friends in Washington to support an asylum seeker, reported NBC News.
The full name of the actor in the case of Grace v. Sessions submitted by the American Union of Civil Liberties in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said that her friend "and the innocent children were members of her violent gang," but U.S. officials violated her request for asylum on 20 July.
She was kept in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, as the nations are facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy was adopted in 2014 by the Board of Appeals for Migrants which allowed undocumented immigrants to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The week, in a statement, the Advocate General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said that the new policy "is a decade of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires all claims for asylum to be tried on the facts and particular circumstances of the request, and for such reason this principle is violated, the case of a court friend said.
Lawyers continued to argue that immigration policy would damage the US economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
The Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges not to continue giving asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or partnership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in its policy release on 11 June.
The asylum has never been intended to address all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Rescue forces deployed in Palu as the number of deaths doubles in the fight against time to find the supersedes
For the subsidized, the situation has become increasingly horrendous.
"It is very intense," said Risa Kusumuma, a 35-year-old mother, while working at her home with a child with fever in the evacuation centre in the fortunate city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulance brings the body.
Clean water is waste."
Residents appeared to return to their lost houses, search in their water-stained things, try to save as much as they can.
Hundreds of people were displaced and hospitals, destroyed by 7.5 earthquakes, were too filled.
Some of the shipments, including Two Haris, who suffered from back and back injuries, remained outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside because of constant shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he reported that the violent earthquake moved the land of the colony in the fifth century that he was using with his wife and father.
"There was no chance of saving ourselves.
I rushed with the rest of my life, I thought," Haris told the Associated Press, and added that his family was in place for eggs.
"I listened to Martha tired for help, then silent.
I don't know what happened to her and me.
We don't expect them to be safe."
The US ambassador charges China with "bullying" with "proclaimed advertisements"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a complaint on four pages in a U.S. newspaper that is trying to sell the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador for China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to China's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to enter into the US Congress elections on 6 November, accused China of abandoning.
The trial of Trump that Beijing was trying to enter the US elections marked by what the U.S. officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in a campaign going from Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that scales through tariff rounds on each of them's imports.
China’s revalidation tariffs at the beginning of the commercial war were designed to reach exporters in states such as Iowa supporting the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, United States Ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, major exporter of agricultural goods for China, said Beijing threatened US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad on an opinion page in the Ten Moines Register of Chad, "now doubles this advertising by making advertisements in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the government of China is using the extreme American tradition of free expression and free print by placing advert paid in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the state of the newspapers down the road here in Beijing, it will find limited dissemination voices and will not see a true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on the problem economic traction of China, as the medium is under the restriction of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China’s most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, although he did not have any paper.
The Republics of Qed addressed the voters before the elections of the Half-End with the Kavanaugh Debate, the Analysts vs.
As many Republicans of the province support and defend the name of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh while facing several allegations of sexual assault, analysts hoped they would see an adverse reaction, particularly during the next half-term elections.
The emotions about this were very high, and most of the Republicans are already officially showing that they want to drive by vote.
These things can't come back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University to The Hill for an article published on the Week.
Reeher said it is doubtful that the impotence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arisona) for an FBI investigation will be sufficient to stop the caste voters.
"Women won't call what's going to happen again - they won't call it again or again in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn Week, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Sunday morning, the demonstrators sang "Went November!" as they protested in the Senate Hall as the Republicans who are controlling the Judicial Committee decided to run on the name of Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high, said Stu Rothenberg, a non-participating political analyst at the news site.
"People are saying that they were already tall; and really.
"But they may be higher, especially among women voting in sub-buffers and smaller voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who, while not being asked by the President, often do not vote."
Even before Ford’s public statement that gave details of its allegations of sexual assault against the name of the Supreme Court, the analysts suggested that it might follow an adverse reaction if the Republicans were to conduct a confirmation.
"This has been a full move for GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Republican, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"This concerns not only the vote of the committee or the final vote on whether Kavanaugh is placed on the bank, it also concerns the way the Republicans manage and deal with this situation," said the news station Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group helping to free the Democrats.
However, the Americans appear to be somehow shared over those who believe in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh statements, with a little more support for the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents definitively or probably committed Ford’s statement, while 35 per cent said that they definitively or probably trusted Ford’s statement.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that Kavanaugh probably or definitely gave up during his statement, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the invasion of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and the other less aggrieved, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed before the Judicial Committee of the Year under an oath last week that Kavanaugh was attacked by a 17-year-old citizen.
Ramirez explained that the name of the Supreme Court exposed its genitals to it while they were in a festival when they were studying in Yale in the mines.
The World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Start a New Internet to compete against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch a new business that seeks to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open source platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Strong allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee noted that the intention after Inrupt is "world domination."
"We need to do it now," he said about the new business.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their "personal online data chain" or POD.
This may include contact lists, lists of what should be done, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on the same browser and all at the same time.
What makes the unique online data chain is that it is fully in the hands of the user that can access what type of information.
The company calls this "personal autonomy through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to CEO of company John Bruce, is that the company brings resources, process skills and appropriate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform assigned by IBM, some staff developers who have a contract to work on the project, and a volunteer coder community.
By starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they should introduce a complete change where all their commercial models are raised up today.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a place on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when it established a World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"There is no optimum enough for this next season of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Cleric Celebration of the Victoria Cross of First World War
The only clergy of the Church of England who won Victoria Cross during World War I as combatants was celebrated in its spring 100 years later.
Lt Kur Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack in Bellenglishe and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he won the highest British military honour.
The week opened a memorial call from its two nepots in a device in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his neputies, Michael Vann, said that it was "beautiful symbol" that the ring had to be blown exactly 100 years after the winning of the nanu's prize.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt Kur brought his battalion to the other side of the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a lot of shells and shots from chips on the ground and machine guns."
Later it is quick for the fire line and with the "great courage" brought the line forward before it went to a corner on its own and lost from its three senses from the body.
Lt Kur was killed by German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said his actions were "something I know we can never achieve but something very embarrassing."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also put garland behind the parapet, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored that he had a role in this device" and added "the courage of genuine heroes was being shown by the support that many people would give."
MMA parties remained awake all night to see Bellator 206, instead of knocking with Peppa Pig
Picture this, stay awake all night to see Bellator 206 packed to stop looking at the main event.
The list from San Jose included 13 wars, including six on the main card and were being shown directly during the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
In the 6th year, as Gegard Musasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the United Kingdom's spectators stayed with them when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they had been raised for hours, especially for the fight.
One party on Twitter describes the change to the child card as "some kind of fungal joke."
"There is a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was therefore not appropriate for children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of the marketing and communication of Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"The time is up," yes.
The president of Belator Scott Cooker said they would work on their schedule to include future United Kingdom telescopes.
"I think that when we think about repetition, we can probably arrange something," said Cooker.
"But now there are the sixth Sunday morning and we will not be able to arrange until the Day of our time, the Second of their time.
But we're working on it.
My friends, when I was in the mood there were a lot of passing messages and not all were released.
We were trying to fix the solution, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can tell you the next time it won't happen.
We will limit it to five wars rather than six -- as we usually did -- and our proof has been given more to the parties and instead of too much morna.
It's a lucky situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of sexuality
The Olympic poet Tom Daley says that adults feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but this tattoo motivates success.
The 24-year-old man said it wasn't realistic until the second that "not everyone like me."
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said to talk about the rights of homosexuals to give "tami" to others.
He also said that when a parent became more involved than winning the Olympics.
The regular presentation of the previous program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
While he appeared as a dead person on Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt "less than" another worker was and grew up because "it was socially unacceptable to welcome the guests and the girls."
He said, "To this day, those emotions that you feel less than, and you feel different, were the real things that were beyond the power and power we could have achieved."
He wanted to prove that it was "something," he said, not to disappoint everyone when eventually they learned about his sexuality.
The Olympic bronze medallist for two times became a high profile promoter for LGBT and used its appearance in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexality.
He said that he spoke because he felt lucky that he could live freely without any amorous and wanted to give "wait" to another worker.
The world winner for three times said that when he fell in love with a man - a film producer from the United States Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "was surprised" for him.
Daley married Oscar's winner, who is 20 years older than he, last year but said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When he passed so many things at such a young age - until his first 14-year-old Olympics and father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced a similar good and Korean experience.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all perspective" was changed.
"If I had asked the past year, because the important thing was that we should "have to win a gold medal," he said.
"I know what, there are more things than Olympic gold medals.
The medal of my Olympic debt is Robbie."
A son has the same name as father Robert, who died in 2011 40 years after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and one of the things he had requested was if they had already had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I can't say 'it won't be here to be in the front row," he said.
"An account is kept going when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally recognized that it was not inviolable," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I know that this was what I've created all my life - that we've gone a step ahead of countries in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspires his first choice of his conjugate - Proud of Heather Small - which was compatible with him in the course of the Olympics and still hit the edge.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Friday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson no longer in the form remains on the bank at Ryder Tazza on Saturday
American Phil Mikkelson will record the Week when playing his 47th game of the Ryder Tazza, but he will have to change his shape to avoid being such an important stage.
Mickelson, who plays in the 12-time biennial event for record, stayed on the bank from Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and the Foursomes of the Week.
Rather than being the centre of action, as was often for the United States, the great winner of its five-fold range of days between which it was supporting and working on its game from the distance with the hope of correcting its contents.
One who has never given the right balloon even in the thousands of his career, the 48-year-old man is not ideal for the difficult course of Le Golf National, where the distance is long after the other is due to misappropriate.
And if the only course is not enough to win the heart, Mikkelson, in the nineth game, faces the exact champions of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, new for the season, to win all their four games this week.
If the Americans, with four points less than the start of the 12 single games, start well, the game of Mikkelson can prove to be very crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, stuck on his back and put his arms around him and said that he would be ready yet," Furyk said.
"It has a lot of confidence in it itself.
It is Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't see two parties playing.
I saw more, but this is the way I worked and this is the way we thought it would go.
He must be out there, like another man."
Mickelson will skip Nick Faldo's record for the most part of the Ryder Tazza that played the harp.
This may mark the end of the race of the Ryder Tazza which at least never reached the millions of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 winnings, 20 losings and seven half, although Furyk said his presence has brought some interesting things to the team.
"It brings you in, sarcastic, humorous, love to work with people, and a very good man who has you in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players at age took pleasure in criticizing them, this week, which was something fun to see.
It provides much more than just games."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn whose major position on the front can spread quickly
Mr Bjorn, European Captain, knows from experience that a reduced position before the last day's singles on the Ryder Tazza can easily be changed on a slow journey.
The Danish did his debut in the 1997 game in Valderama, where a led side by Seven Ballesteros held a five-point advantage on the Americans but ended up with a clear margin of already true, with a win of 1411⁄2-131/2.
"Keep remembering yourself that we had a big front in Valderama; we had a big front in Brooklyn, where we lived, and in Valderama, where we enjoyed, but a little," Bjorn said, in the press, after seeing the 2018 Class 5-3 win the week and the flowers to be on the front with 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone in this team that is still not clear.
It's still going with your hand and your body.
Get out and do all the good things.
It is still not clear until the points on the team have been brought.
We have a goal, and what he's trying to hide is this trophy, and the focus is still there.
I've always said, focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but I know exactly what is on the other side - the biggest players in the world."
Satisfying how his players played on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "Qatt doesn't go another step from here.
A different challenge.
It still concerns the individual performances we have seen, and this is something different.
It's very nice to be out with your partner when things are going well, but when you're out individually, then it's tested for your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you want to pass to the players, which will issue your best yet.
Now, let the friend follow you and he needs to go and out his best, too."
In contrast to Bjorn, the opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to play better individually than when they did as partners, with exceptions that are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who bought three points from four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of the last few days that can change everything, after he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before a lost piece as Europe did the "Midnah Miracle."
"Remembering at least a word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, prepared his players before the last day.
"We still have 12 important parties, but they want to get to that start as soon as they did in Brooklyn, as they did in Medinah.
When that moment arrives on one side, place a lot of pressure on those half-party parties.
We designed our list as appropriate and put those men in the way we felt, you know, trying to do a few more miracles."
Thomas had been given the task of trying to lead the fight back and facing Roy McIllroy in the best game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the best half of the order.
"I die with this group of men this way because I think it covers all the way," Bjorn said about his singles options.
Germany's new war is over again
The latest new fleet fleet fleet had to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the time-consuming start-up fleets, but there would not be at least one year of entry due to defects and increased costs, reports the local media.
The commission of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main new fireship of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, has now been posted for the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit which quotes military statements.
The ship had to join the Naval Fleet in 2014, but the problem issues after delivery sent the destination of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuertemberg class vessels ordered by the Naval Fleet back in 2007 will be replaced by Bremen class frigates operating.
It is understood that they will have a strong presence, a vision of missiles against aircraft and ships as well as certain warning technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - this should be possible to operate the newest to two years away from home ports.
However, continuous delay means that the last technology vessels - which mentioned enable Germany to project power out of control - will already be ancient by the time they enter the service, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 F125 of a bad fortune appeared in the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and return to the castle of Bloom & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Naval fleet returned ship to one of the ships after its arrival.
It was little known about the reasons for this, but the German media quotaed a number of crucial "software and heat defects" which made the ship useless if it was fired on a combat mission.
The defects in the software were particularly important as the Baden-Wuertemberg class ship will be operated by about 120 sea crew - only half of the workers on the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the ship has a very high load to reduce its performance and limit the ability of the Naval fleet to increase future updates.
The 7,000-tonnes "Rheinland-Pfalz" is understood to be twice as thick as similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to severe defects, the full project price - including crew training - is also being a problem.
It is estimated that this has reached an estimated amount of €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - from €2.2 billion initial.
The problems of the newest outbreaks are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s Naval Power is falling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Naval fleet is currently "having a lack of ships flying the coast."
The official said that the problem was time-bound, as ancient ships were commissioned but replacement vessels were not provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuertemberg classmates could join the Naval Fleet.
National Trust refers to the secret life of nightlife
A new research on land in Scotland aims to discover how the nightlife uses land when searching for food.
It is hoped that the findings will show new light on the behaviour of single mammals flying and helping to guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists in the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as free night cancella with their long veins and Daubenton in Jonna Inverewe in Western Ross.
Special records will be placed in key locations around the property to trace nighttime activities during the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile testing using hand-held detectors.
An expert analysis of the hearings of all recordings will verify the frequency of nighttime calls and what species are doing.
Then a housing map and a report will be produced that will create a detailed landscape scale of their conduct.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitats are most important for nightlife and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of living management work such as the creation of grasslands and how best to keep transport for the rest of the night and other associated species.
The nightlife population in Scotland and around the United Kingdom decreased considerably over the past century.
They are at risk of building and development that affects the crops and loss of life.
Wind turbines and light can also create a risk, as can valve paper to catch insects and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The cold of night is currently not cool.
However, because of their nightly hunting traditions they see them are more useful than their eyes when they come to catch the price.
They use sophisticated environmental technique to indicate insects and obstacles in their passage when flying.
The NTS, which is responsible for the treatment of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important genes and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the frigate very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, inspections of plants and sometimes rescues.
The organisation even established the first and only reserve of Scotland's nightlife in the land Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which belongs to eight tenths of the school's nightlife.
Property manager David Thompson says property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a very good area for the rest of the night," he said.
"We have the old building, a lot of veterinary shelters and all good housing.
But there is much more about the fry of the night that is not yet known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about what it takes to breathe."
It underlines the importance of checking the nightlife for maintenance in property as it is possible that an unintended abortion of one maternity bed can kill up to 400 women and young people, possibly killing a whole local population.
The nightlife is protected and it is illegal to kill them, force them or burn them or read their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Conservative Trust Officer, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have much to learn about the frigging nature of our night and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations as the lawyers are ready to seek a German magazine
Christian Ronaldo noted allegations of bullying against him as "false news," saying that people "will want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are expected to search the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The leading player of Portugal and Juventus was accused of rape an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a living room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was alleged to have paid $375.000 to say nothing about the incident, reported Der Spiegel last week.
While speaking on video on Instagram Live with 144 million of its followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, noted the reports as "false news".
"Le, le, le, le.
What he said today, crazy news," said the winner of Ballon d'Or for five times while watching the camera.
"I have to encourage them themselves by using names.
It's normal.
They must be famous to say names, but this is part of the work.
I am a happy man and everything will be well," the crying increased, with enthusiasm.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file with Der Spiegel on allegations, which are called "immissible reporting of suspects in the field of privacy," according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player seeks compensation for " Moral damage in an amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is likely one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga had been allegedly returned to the lodger's room, where it was allegably surprised by the anus, according to documents submitted to the District Court of County Clark in Nevada.
Majorga argues that Ronaldo fell upon his back after the incident alleged that he was "99 per cent" "good man" dissipated by "one per cent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sex, but that was consensus.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to a solution outside the court because she said "showed out of retalization" and was concerned that "to be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to understand the solution as it is being traumatized by the incident alleged.
Ronaldo was able to join Real Madrid by Manchester United when the alleged attack was made, and this drought was accompanied by Italian Youth football legends in an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "always apologizes" that has lost car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "always apologizes" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "required" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the borders in the case of Brexit of no agreement would affect jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Auris and Avensis of Toyota - has produced nearly 150,000 cars last year that 90% of them have been exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a stop in production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other United Kingdom manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Mini plant for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is related to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the case of Brexit of no agreement.
Today's Toyota production line works on the basis of "just in time", with a party receiving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and in the EU for cars to be carried out in accordance with order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be a gap within the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortcomings of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep an inventory of more than a day in her Derbyshire plant, said the company, and therefore production would be stopped.
Mr Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls."
"We need an agreement. We need the best agreement to allow, as I say, not only success to enjoy the present but to take this opportunity," said the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we should definitely be able to continue what was a great success set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production was stopped, but in a longer period, it was hoped that increased costs would reduce plant competitiveness and possibly lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the conventioner of the Union in the plant, said his members are becoming more and more depressed: "In my experience when these jobs are gone, they never come back.
A statement to the government said: "We have relaunched a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The risky meeting of Donald Trump with Advocate General Rod Rosenstein may "be delayed by another week" as the battle continues on the title of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, said White House on Thursday.
Rosenstein takes into account the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between the assistance of Trump and Russia and potential obstacle to justice by the president.
If Trump is not going to join the general lawyer or not, and thus jeopardises Mueller's independence, he urged Washington's excess for a month.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed street clothes to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein closed the report.
But the other two are with the White House, although there were reports that would reverse.
Instead, he announced a meeting with Trump, which was then being held by the United Nations in New York, scheduled for Friday.
Trump said he "p prefers not" to interrupt Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid discriminating with the hearing of the Senate judicial committee containing Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom gave their testimony.
On Monday, Trump ordered the FBI to carry out an investigation of claims against Kavanaugh over a period of one week, which delayed more full vote of the Senate.
On Thursday, the stamp secretary of Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When asked questions about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "There has not yet been a date for this, it can be held this week, and it can be done next week because of all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But now we've seen and I've always loved keeping up to date."
Some journalists challenge this claim: Sanders does not hold a press meeting in the White House since 10 September.
The representative of Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of meetings was not due to a lack of appreciation with TV journalists "to try to pull and influence audiences", although he said, "although we agree with the fact that they try to pull and influence audiences."
It then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the print would increase.
"The President makes more sessions of Questions and Answers than any President who has agreed," she added without adding any evidence: "We are aware of those numbers."
The meetings will still continue to be held, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, this is better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this very much and we can do this many times in the last few weeks and this will replace the press meeting where one can talk to the President of the United States."
A group rarely answers questions when leaving the White House or when participating in open sessions or press conferences when visiting the diaries.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he behaved in a relaxed manner and sometimes broke up in front of a group of journalists.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland on Brexit-related youth
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and desire to remain there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months to the United Kingdom leaving the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to entering into the cost of defined status applications for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on exit continued, leading to expected decisions on this issue.
But the United Kingdom Government was also increasing its preparations for a possible scenario of no agreement.
I know that this is certainly an unstable time for you all.
It is therefore that I would not support now as much as I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from across the EU, and beyond, bring them with experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and they are of benefit to the patients and the communities they serve.
Scotland is absolutely comfortable and I would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Performs Emergency Surgery After He Suffers Correction in Rasu
Tennessee State Tigers' lineback Christion Abercrombie made an emergency surgery after he suffered a stroke on Saturday when his team died against Vanderbilt Commodores by 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The main cause of the state of Tennessee Rod Reed told journalists that the correction took place shortly before halftime.
"There's me on the side line and like I've been there," Reed said.
The nurse and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before placing it on a stresser and taking it back for further examination.
An official from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was no longer operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris adds that "so far there is no detail about the type/extent of correction" and the state of Tennessee is trying to understand when the correction is made.
Abercrombie, a student at the second year of suspended university, is at his first stage with the state of Tennessee after leaving Illinois.
The whole week he had five tacles before he left the game, which led to the total of 18 tackles of his season.
Foreign buyers will be required to pay more on the bull tax when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be required to pay more on the ticket tax when buying property in the United Kingdom with extra money used to assist homeless people under new Tory plans
This change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in boll tax will be imposed on those who are not paying tax in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects it to rise to £120 million a year - to help people without home
Today Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers will pay a higher rate of bull tax when buying property in the United Kingdom - with extra money used to help people without home.
The change will be regarded as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and target those who pay high wages.
The increase in boll tax will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with extra money, spurring government efforts to combat road sleep.
The additional payment - which is additional to the tax of the current bull, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on the second house and the purchases for the purpose of returning — may be three per cent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to £120 million per year.
About 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by non-United Kingdom residents, increasing prices and thus making it more difficult for new purchasers to take the first step in the purchase of accommodation.
Many urban areas of the country - especially in the capital city - have become "pretty cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who fall very much from their time abroad.
The new policy was issued only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in ball tax so that younger people could be helped to buy their first home.
It accused grand construction firms that were maintaining high property prices by occupying the land and not using it, and encouraged Ms May to place quotas on roofs to set up "the situation of complete housing" in the United Kingdom.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed accommodation reforms to reach the eye, including car checks and the end of "no cake".
It also needs to give the councils great powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "The past year I said I would dedicate my job to re-establishing the dream of the United Kingdom - that life should be better for every new generation.
And this means we're going to set up the broken market of our accommodation.
The United Kingdom will remain open to people who want to live, work and live here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, find it easy to purchase homes as large as the United Kingdom's elected residents.
For many people the dream of having a home has become too popular, and the intensity of street sleep remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland"
The head of Sunderland Jack Ross says his "fundamental ambition" is that sometimes the management of Scotland is done.
The Scots, 42 years old, is facing the challenge of re-emerged Grigal’s club, which is now in the third place in League One, with three points different from that in the first place.
This snow is led to Stadium of Light after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to play for countries as a player.
I got B cap and nothing else," Ross told the Sports Sound of the BBC of Scotland.
"But when I was a child, I often had an account going with my father when I saw Scotland playing in Hampden, and it always keeps that thing inviting me back.
However, this opportunity will only be made if we succeed in managing clubs."
The former Ross as manager of Sunderland included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he is not concerned about the fact that he would follow such names in such large clubs, while he previously rejected the offer from the City of Barnesley and Ipswich.
"Now, the success for whom will be based on "Can I get this club back to the Prime Minister League?"
In view of the structure and facilities of this club there is no doubt that this club belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'm probably not supposed to have succeeded here only if we can get the dogs back there."
Ross only spent three years in his career as a manager, after a period of assisted caps in Dumbarton and after 15 months with the Hearts coking staff.
It then helped Alloa recover from the relexin for the third category, and transformed St. Mirren from the relexin xyx to a winner of the title of the Championship next season.
And Ross says he's now feeling more comfortable than he felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
With regard to taking Allao into his hands, it is a reminder that "Probably this was a big change."
"I think again that the manager's position was the most appropriate for her, much more than that of the plaintiff.
This may sound strange by taking good care of myself, having a decent life, and enjoying some reasonable gains.
But games can be difficult.
There are many things you have to go through each week.
One sister has not experienced this in terms of stress and labour pressure but has simply felt that the manager’s job is suitable for her.
I have always wanted to manage and now I am doing this, and I feel that all my adult life is now feeling the most comfortable."

A study found that the best time to take a beer paint is at 5.30pm at night
The heat wave has inspired the United Kingdom pubs' profit which are in difficulty but has increased pressure on the restaurants of the same company.
In July, groups of pubs and bars saw an increase of 2.7 per cent in sales - but figures revealed that the profit in restaurants was reduced by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business consultancy CGA, who collected the figures, said: "The absence of continuing and long-term participation of England in the World Tax had meant that July followed a similar model for the previous month of June, when the sales in the pubs increased by 2.8 per cent, except for restaurants even more.
The reduction of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trade in June continued to occur in July.
The pubs and bars whose main sale is drinking were the best ones in terms of financial results compared to the previous period while the sales of restaurants were reduced.
The pubs whose main sales are food also suffered in heat, although not dramaticly as restaurant operators.
People seem to want to just get out of drinking.
In pubs and mostly managed drinking sales increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food fell to three per cent."
Paul Newman, one of the RSM analysts on entertainment and hospitality said: "These results continue to lead us to the end of April.
The time and impact of major social events or sports remains the most important factors in the sales of take-ways market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to find it difficult, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent a year will be particularly heavy in addition to constant costs.
The hot and long winter cannot be worse for operators whose main sales are food and time can only give advice on whether the more moderate temperatures we experience in August will provide the necessary nutrients."
The growth of total sales in pubs and restaurants, including the opening of new businesses, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a reduction in the pace in the start of new businesses.
The monitoring of the sales of the industry Caffer Peach Tracker for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes the performance date from 47 operating groups, with a combined income of more than £9 billion, and is the industry's established benchmark.
One out of five children has secret social media accounts hidden from their parents
Research reveals that one out of every five children - some of them at the age of 11 - has secret social media accounts hidden from their parents and teachers
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the "Insta leaf" page
News has big times that sex content is being posted
One-hundred percent of students said they had "first" account to show their parents
One out of every five children - some of them at the age of 11 - is creating social media accounts hiding from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed rapid growth in the "Insta fraud" accounts - a reference to the website for the sharing of Instagram photos.
The news has great occasions where sexual content is posted.
Eighty percent of students said they operate a presentable "first" account to show their parents, while others have private.
The mother who met her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a young man who was encouraging others to admire her - "Strengthen me."
The research, by Digital Avariness UK and Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, with half their consent to keep private accounts.
The head of HMC Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that many young people are being raised to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Eileh Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" on the board of Scotch Athletics
Eilh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Board as an executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most athletes of the course and not of the course that the most winning medals and President Ian Beattie described this change as a great opportunity for those leading sport to benefit from its extensive experience at international level during the last decade.
"It is very respected in the Scottish athletic community, the United Kingdom and the world and we are certain that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by becoming part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "We are eager to act as a mouthpiece for athletes and we believe we can contribute very well and help lead sports in Scotland."
The United States, which won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Games in Atlanta among its total of four medals of Olympics and which is now a regular critic of the BBC, is hardly moving after suffering from a small population attack.
On Twitter he writes: "As today month I give me a population.
Don't be shy.
The doctor said that only time can give us advice on whether or not I recover or what point.
It was hard work but recovered completely, learning how to breathe again, and today we are doing agitating exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
An advertising of the breast pump comparing mothers to babies gives place to different online opinions
A side pump company has placed for different online opinions with a warning similar to those of pregnant women who are being kidnapped.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered "the first breast pump in the world that can be released and does not make noise," Elvie’s technological company has issued an inspired announcement from an ironic music video to show the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers who use breast pumps.
Four real mothers sleep in a stomach filled with poor babies with a disc that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I come to myself but I don't have any regrets" and "In case I didn't give them, they're not fat but fat."
The choir continues: "Pamp out, push out, push my kids, push outside, push out, I kiss my women."
However, the notice published on the company’s Facebook page caused online controversy.
With 77,000 spectators and hundreds of comments, the video received different reactions from viewers, many of whom say that it sheds light on the "terrors" of the milk industry.
Someone wrote "It was a very bad decision that the poor were used to advertise this product.
They need to be pregnant and breast-feeding in order to produce milk, except for their children to take them for a few days from birth."

Another commented: "One understands that this is a traumatic thing for both mother and child.
But why didn't they use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers holding their babies?"
Someone else says, "Advert is really cut off from reality."
Others defend the commercial, with women admitted to finding the "very fun" disc.
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I had told you, we would still have sold one.
The pumping had made me feel the same as a cow.
The advertising is a little or too young but I took it from him.
This is a generic product," wrote someone.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertising aimed at mothers who push (often at their workplace or in the toilet) and feel like "poor".
This is not a complaint that distorts or condemns the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women knew that they were all breathing with pumps that did not put their brains in the eye.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who push their breasts say they feel like poor.
However, Elvie Pump, does not make any noise, has no wire or tube and sits in a nest without giving it into the eye, thereby giving women the freedom to move, keep their children, and even go out while they are pushing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that would create a courageous and provocative launch.
By comparing the women who use the breast pump with the milk powder we want to focus on the pumping of the breast and all the challenges it brings, while showing fun and how one can relate to it, the incredible sense of freedom that will bring the new pump with it.
This is not the first time Elvie pump appeared on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the couch for designer Marta Jacubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children don't have a word to say to the Tende Camp in Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased dramatically despite the fact that the border section in the last month has not changed too much, partly because rhetoric and bad policies introduced by the administration of Trump made it more difficult for children to be placed with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and they feared that if they presented themselves to take care of children they would endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their homes would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and Customs enforcement officer, witnessed before the Congress that the agency arrested twenty people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"About 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or sponsors' members are here illegally in the country, and many of them are foreign criminals.
So they are still looking for these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In order to speed up the process involving children, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the exelter workers.
Many will appear through a video telephone conference, rather than personally, to bring arguments in favour of their case to a legal status to an immigration judge.
Those deemed eligible for aid will be deported immediately.
According to telltale workers and reports from the system in recent months, more children are not kept under custody, it is more likely that they will become older or older, which may lead them to express themselves in a violent or attempted manner.
Lawyers said that this concern would increase in a larger facility such as Turnillo, where it is more likely to ignore signs that a child would be/she would be finding it difficult, due to the size of the facility.
They added that children's movement to the teenage city without sufficient time to prepare emotionally or without saying health to their partners could lead to trauma that many are already fighting.
Syria tells the United States, France and Turkey "opposing forces" to withdraw immediately
While addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Moulalem, also serving as a prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on the Syrian territory, with the excuse of the fight against terrorism, and "will be properly addressed."
"They shall withdraw immediately and without any condition," said the assembly.
Moulalem points out that the "war against terrorism almost ended" in Syria, where by 2011 more than 360,000 people had died, with millions more have been moved from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "to fight this sacred battle until they are defeated by all Syrian territories" both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, many of which are training and consulting both Kurdish and Syrian forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-affected country.
With regard to the refugee issue, Moualem said that the conditions were good for them to return, and "in some Western countries" was arrested because "irradiated visits" led to refugees to stay away.
"We join the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are policyging what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union hoped there would be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a meeting area in the last major rebels of Idlib created an opportunity to continue political work.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoids a major attack on the Syrian forces supported by the Russians on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action aimed at the guerrillas including the fight against the Al-Qaeda Front, which "will be broken".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mitura is looking forward to calling immediately the first meetings of a new committee made by government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be restricted to "review of the articles of the current constitution", and extended against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Second Mandate
With this logic, in 2020 Mr Trump will win the election again because, as many liberal spectators expect, the complaint and scandal will end its presidency before the time.
What is undoubtedly "the most dramatic final ever in the presidency!"
Until now, it seems that the spectators are not working yet.
Since 2014, the time classifications with the largest number of telescopes have increased by more than twice to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in time with the largest number of viewers, more than 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has increased television ratings by up to 3.5 million viewers in the main news series.
"This is a situation that attracts people because we don't understand anything," said Neal Baer, a representative of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who will be president after an attack reading the Chapter.
In Scovell, author of the Veteran Comets and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
It recalls winning a tax in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? She asked.
"You said, 'Don't touch me,' said Mrs. Scovell.
In this case there is a value of fun.
No doubt, unlike anything else on TV, the titles of stars coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
To see what is happening around you is to realize that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, this goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself following a panel of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward's "deep background" support for his book "Fear," the skin bomber ("the clothes that reflect pride," said The Washington Post) of Paul Manafort with a value of $15,000 and the implications of Mr. Trump's anatomical anatomism descriptions by Stormy Daniel.
For example, I will never again look at Super Mario in the same way.
"Part of what is doing so much is reality show is that every night you're getting something out of it," said Brent Montgomery, executive head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", on the box changing and developing in the daily course of the Trump programme (fighting with N.F.L., kicking Kim Jong-un).
You cannot afford to have one episode title due to either falling back.
When I contacted Mr Fleiss this week, outside the weather was hot at 80 degrees Fahrenheit [80 ° C] on the coast of Kauai, but he was shocked inside to see the MSNBC while recording the CNN.
It could not be charged before television, not when Brett Kavanaugh was ready to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
"Remember when we used to do those essential programmes and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a joke, but in fact they had reason."

Large amounts of money coming from outside for the most narrowest start in the midterm White House election
It is not surprising that the seventeenth Congressional districts of Pennsylvania are showing a large amount of money, with the power to re-alignment of congressional districts that acquired two operators in a race for the same seat.
This recently re-established the bridge of Pittsburgh's suburban district – the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last night.
Lamb is issuing as a candidate against another operator, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the twelve clean districts of Pennsylvania, which extends very much over the new twelve districts.
The map was re-established after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the wood districts were anti-constitutionally closed in favour of the Republicans.
The success in the new seventeenth districts led to a difficult competition of the financial campaign between the main party's funds, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) (Congressional Committee of the Democratic Campaign) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC) (National Committee of the Republican Campaign).
Lamb became a family name in Pennsylvania after winning a few differences in the special election of March followed by a lot of follow-up to the eighteenth Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That seat was of Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political criticisms gave the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States Is To Penalize El Salvador Talli Support China, Then They decided Not to Do This
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with some assistance from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a welcome meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and had a place in Panama until some of his friends dropped off the administrative team of the Organisation of Trump.
Officials of the Department of State decided to contact the American heads of diplomatic missions again by El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said the statement by the Department of Heather Nauert, in a statement early this month.
But the penalties were taken into account only against El Salvador, which received around $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be weighted for the country of Central America and its high unemployment and death rates.
As internal meetings began to make progress, North American and Central American officials proposed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year that was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with the aim of effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence was strongly criticised to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration puts on the meeting, said the diplomats.
And the three sent back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new message or message and heavy mail from Washington.
In the White House, Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were supported by a foreign analyst who is close to administration and also talking about the condition of anonymity.
History Study
The next unexpected negative event could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible distortion of justice by Mr Trump, which now has very substantial evidence in the public register.
It was reported that Mr Mueller is also investigating whether Mr Trump's campaign was agreed with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In case the Congress passes to another person, Mr. Trump will find himself responsible in that body, as he prepares himself to go back to the voters, and perhaps his counsel is legally legal.
This involves a lot of uncertainty, and I do not intend to suggest that Mr Trump's strike is inevitable - and not even his equivalent in Europe.
There are options to be made on both sides of the Atlantic which will affect the extent to which the war has lasted.
In 1938, German officials were ready to take a coup against Hitler, which the West would resist and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We did not succeed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the following years of massacre.
The course of history is based on such points of influence, and the inseparable movement of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Today the Americans face many of these inflation points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump asks Commissioner General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation target?
Rosenstein has been in problems since this document reported that last year, it suggested that the president be secretly recorded and speculative that he is not suitable for the task.
Mr Rosenstein said the report of The Times was not accurate.
"How will we respond if the F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of credible sexual conduct and dissonant testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of the terms for Congress that will keep Mr. Trump responsible?
If we do not pass these tests, there will be a movement in democracy.
But I believe it will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
Ommi was Czechoslovakia which was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the house of my ambassadors.
She was able to live, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, on the day of prayer God sent us to wash the dishes on that table with swastika.
With such a legacy, how can we not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is an optimist before the competitive game with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Friday, knowing that victory against Austria, after the same impressive result that they brought in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Group G of Europe League.
Correlation in the backyard prevented Midfielder Graham Dorrrans from making his first appearance of the season to the same result of 2-2 with Villarreal but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a catalyst for big things.
"This was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"Let's go to the game with the faith that we can get something and get out with a point.
We are probably looking forward to the end but, however, the same outcome was probably fair.
They're probably better in the first half of the game while we're better dead in the second half.
Friday will again be a great European night.
We hope we can get three points but this will be difficult because they have had a good outcome in their last game but, with the background around us, we are certain that we can continue to do our best and achieve a positive outcome.
The past year was certainly difficult, among other things, by my own corrections and changes in the clubs themselves, but despite this now there is a sense of positiveness.
The team is good and the guests are having a lot of fun; the training is good.
I hope we can do our best now, win the final stage and win."
Women are worried about this fear related to the loss of retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be incorporated, few people were talking to their family members about it.
About half of the subjects in the nationwide study said they were talking to their spouse about the long-term treatment cost.
Only 10 percent said to talk to their children about it.
"People want to be a member of the family to drive them, but they don't take the steps to engage," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the insurance business on the life of Nationwide.
You have to start that way.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family for treatment if you do not express your wishes well before time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you will receive treatment, since those options may be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Get your financial consultant: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your long-term funding options may include a traditional long-term treatment insurance policy, a hybrid income insurance policy to help cover these costs or make yourself self-insurance - unless you have the money.
Take a decision after discussing your long-term legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care lawyer to choose a reliable individual to monitor your medical treatment and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes if you cannot communicate.
In addition, consider a prosecutor for your finances.
Choose a person who is responsible for making financial decisions for you and be sure your accounts will be paid if you are disabled.
See the details: Imagine your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan so you can be ready.
"Not only are the funds involved, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the sheep?

A man has several times been contacted by aircraft hijackings in Ilfracombe
A man was met several times by plane helicopters as he walked back after a night out.
The victim, who was over seven years old, was in the area of Oxford Grove of IIfracombe, Devon, when encountered by birds in his or her head, abdomen and arms.
Officials described the shooting, which took place about 02:30 BST, as "casual act".
The victim was not his attacker.
Its corrections are not a threat to life and the police called for evidence.
Theremitis and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by earthquakes and violent tsunamis killing the city of Palu in Indonesia last week, officials said, with the expected number of deaths increased.
In the absence of the communication lines, aid officials could not obtain any information from the Regiment of Doghea, which is a region in the Palu Mountain near the earthquake epicenter with a force of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
These are some key facts about Palu and Doghea, about the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central province of Sulawesi, located on the coast of the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquakes and tsunamis struck the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dothraa is a giant that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) of the coast in the Sulawesi Island Master.
The municipality, an administrative region under the province, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the economic pillars of the central province of Sulawesi, in particular the coastal region of Doghía.
The nickel mine is also important in the province, but it is most concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Doghea have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, he killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, tsunamis also hit the West side of Donghaa, and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Ring of Fire of the Sixmic Pacific and is often hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the upper part of Sumatra struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of healthy earthquakes killed the West of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, beyond the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 South Java earthquake struck, which is Indonesia’s most popular island, struck a tsunami that hit the South coast with a great amount of force, and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: Theremot with a strong 7.6 fall near the city of Padang, the capital city of the province of West Sumatra.
Kill more than 1,100 people.
2010: Terremoth with a force of 7.5 hits one of the Isles of Mentawai, beyond Sumatra, which shot up to 10 metres high and killed about 300 people.
2016: Theremot fell down the resistance of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, which caused as much noise and panic as people took part in the destruction of the earthquake and the deadly tsunamis of 2004.
This time no tsunamis were fired, but more than 100 were killed because of a car accident.
2018: Great earthquakes struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, which killed more than 500 people, mostly on the top of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of temporary isolated tourists.
The eldest child of Sarah Palin arrested on domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, which interfered with a domestic violence report and resisted the arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when female acquaintances tried to recruit the police to report the alleged offences, it received their phone from her.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su Pretreal Facility and is being held on an unencumbered bond of $500, reports the KTUU.
He appeared the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "certainly, not given" when asked to give his motive, reported the network.
Palin is facing three Class A offences, i.e. he can free up prison for up to a year and has to pay a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B offence, which is punishable by a prison day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with an attack on his father, Todd Palin.
My mother, Sarah Palin, was the police template to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, which interfered with the report of domestic violence, and had a weapon in his possession while he was involved in the incident.
His file was attached to her face with a puncture.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by the veterinary groups after a comparison was made between her child’s violent behavior and the poststratum stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from her service in Iraq.
Terremoth and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after they hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last week.
The territory with a force of 7.5 tons of tsunamis and thousands of houses.
The electricity and communication networks do not work with the number of deaths expected to increase in the next day.
The earthquake just hit a few out of the Sulawesi centre located in Grigal of the capital city of Indonesia, Jakarta.
On the medium are circulating videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when tsunamis hit the valley with great force.
Federal prosecutors are calling for the suspected terrorist attack of NYC to be granted a rare death penalty
Federal prosecutors in New York are asking that Sayfulllo Saipov is suspected of terrorist attacks in New York City which killed eight people being sentenced to death - a rare case which has not been carried out in the state for a federal offence since 1953.
Saipov, who is 30 years old, is alleged to use Home Depot rental track to carry out a road attack on the road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, as in October it was easier for drivers and bicycles to travel.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intensively" has killed eight victims and "intensively" causes serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intention to request the death penalty presented in the South New York District.
According to the Court's document, these two heads of the case bear a penalty of possible death.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court gave Saipov 22 cap of the case which included eight cases of homicide with the aid of organised ricket, which is typically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a charge of violence and car theft.
When they described how Saipov carried out this attack "dangerous, cruel and immoral", the prosecutors said that the attack needed "preventing and meditating."
The intentional notice states that "Sayfulllo Habibullavic Saipov has caused harm, damage, and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's families and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It descended from the South New York District last time you heard a death penalty.
The imputant, Khalid Barnes, found a murder warrant for two drug suppliers but finally a prison sentence was issued in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after finding a copy to be taken to the Soviet Union during the previous two years.
The two Rosenbergs were killed by the electric seat on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of return on the day and month after the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspiring himself to carry out the attack after he saw ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the head of the case.
He also asked that the ISIS flag be placed in his hospital room, the police told him.
He replied in no way to the 22nd head of the case.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who was representing Saipov, said they were "certainly disappointed" with the prosecution decision.
"We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a ground of imprisonment for a year with no possibility of release will continue only to prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team previously asked the prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
The MP Tory says NIGEL FARGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised to "immobilize the people's army".
The former head of Europe said that politicians had to "feel under pressure" by the Eurojectics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that it should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
The government member of the Conservative Party Peter Bone told the demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would have been out" that Mr Farage would have been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile her very shared positions was stressed by Tories who did not favour Brexit, which was linked to a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to keep its Chequers compromise plan on the road between the attacks by Brexitier, those against Brexit and the EU.
The Allies stressed that despite the negative reaction it will continue to move forward to try to reach agreement with Brussels - and to force Eurosectics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and "kaos".
Mr. Bone told the rally Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "break up the Chechers plan".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be given a high social position and be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If I were responsible, we would still be out," he said.
The MP Wellingborough adds: "We will defend Brexit but we need to break the Chechers plan."
When he declared it against the EU, he said: "We do not fight a world war to be a servant.
We need to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone made suggestions that the public opinion was changed by the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and must remain absolutely wrong."
Andrea Jenkins, Brexitiera of Tory, was also present for the demonstration, where she told journalists: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, name the people.
"The plan of Chechers is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, not popular with our party and our activists who are in fact those who go on the streets and who are before voting for us.
Please check the Chequers plan and start your name."
In a message directed to Mrs May, she said: "The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should "feel under pressure" that they would go back from the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - people - and our policy class," he said.
"They're trying to get back from Brexit and we're here today to tell them that "we won't let you sleep if you do this."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience he said: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is at the point of going back from Brexit.
We are mobilising in Brexit the army of the people of this country that has succeeded us and we will not lose until we are an independent, self-governing and proud lady of the United Kingdom."
However, those against Brexit were interested in Birmingham before they made a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group's launch this weekend, a small number of activists started banners with the book Tories Against Brexit (Tories Against Brexit).
Lord Addonis, who has a high social position in the Laburista party, has stopped the Conservatives for security issues that have been dealt with by the party app as soon as the conference opened.
"These are the people who tell us they can have IT systems in force and all technology for Canada and more, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he adds.
"This is a complete farce.
The idea of Brexit well does not exist," he adds.
Warren intends to "examine carefully" the possibility of issuing a presidential election
The United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after November's elections "he will carefully examine the possibility of going out for presidential election".
Boston Globe reports that last Saturday a member of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about its future in a debate with citizens at a municipal level in the West of Massachusetts.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will issue a new election in November against the representative of the State GOP Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the centre of speculation that she could take a place at Trump in 2020.
The Week's afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with the constituents who used the debate format with citizens at municipal level from Trup took over.
A person waiting for the meeting asked whether he had the intention to proceed to the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time "that women go to Washington to win our fragmented government, and that includes a woman in the cage."
arrested in connection with the killing of LSU Sims
On Saturday, the police in Baton Rouge, La., reported that suspect was arrested in connection with the killing of the Wyde Sims basketball player of the LSU that happened next week.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson arrest at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
Weeks are a shooting video, where I asked for help to identify the man who appeared in the video.
Sims, who was 20 years old, was killed near the campus of the University of Southern Week in the morning.
According to 247sports, the seventh chief of police Murphy J. Paul told the media "Wayde Sims suffered from an injury caused by a stroke and eventually died as a result."
Wade came in to defend his partner and met with a flight from Simpson.
Simpson asked questions and admitted that he was on the scene, had a gun, and admitted to save on Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and kept under custody in the East Parish Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, a young man who had six feet and dust in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches to gain world title after his team orders won the win against Sebastian Vettel
On Saturday, from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would have an important part in the race.
From the position inside the first row, Bottas had a good advantage and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel was the first to enter the stopping areas and let Hamilton meet with others at the last place in the group, something that had to be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in the after-circuit stop zone and left immediately after Vettel, but Hamilton continued after a few rounds with a route that led to the Ferrari drivers having difficulty leaving the side of the free entrance because of the risk falling back after a double move to defend in the third canton.
Max Verstappen started from the rear row of the grid and was in the seventh place until the end of the first round in a year of closure at the age of 21.
Then he was on the front for most of the race by not changing his tires with a view to completing quickly and crossing Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He eventually entered the stop zone in about 44 but could not increase his step in the eight turns that remained while Raikkonen entered the fourth place.
It is a difficult day because Valtteri did very well all week long and was a gentleman of truth told me by.
The team did a very extraordinary job to get the first and second place," Hamilton said.
What Was a Very Safe Physical Attitude
President Donald Trump told Senator Diane Feinstein of the 7th week in connection with her insistance that she did not seek the letter from Christine Blasey Ford which she was accusing the person appointed by the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh with sexual assault.
When speaking in rally in West Virginia, the President did not direct the testimony given by Ford before the Senate of the Judicial Committee, but rather commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "violent and unhappy and not sincere."
"The only thing that can happen and the sweet thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and angry and irritable and not sincere," he said.
"When you look at statements and pieces of information and then say "no, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you think?
Diane Feinstein, do you have any information?
I heard her answer... open the document-- "e, e, what is it?
Let me go.
I don't care."
Now, wait a minute.
We're tired... No, we're not hungry," he added, imitating the Senator.
Feinstein you sent her the letter giving details of the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and this earlier broke up in September - but Feinstein insisted that the day was coming from her office.
"I didn't cover Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't cover her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reports The Hill.
"I often kept her confidential and I kept her confidential as she requested."
But it seems that her absence was not met well by the president, who during the rally on Saturday evening commented: "I know what, that was a very wrong physical attitude.
He may not have wanted it, but that is the worst physical attitude I've ever seen."
While continuing with his defence of the person appointed by the Supreme Court, who was charged with sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that Democrats were using allegations for their purposes.
"They are determined to take back the power by any means necessary.
They have seen violence, disgustingness, they do not blame those who commit it, those who commit fraud on wheels to gain power and control," the president said according to media reports.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer hid twice for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have been hit for the loss of the Elite League of Week against Belfast Giants by winning the same opponent game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants gained an advantage of two early gowls in the game with two attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the same point for the team playing in their country before Dwyer again gained an advantage for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard got the same point for Dundee before two holes of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen confirmed their victory.
This was the third winner of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe players, who after many losses advanced to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast last night.
This was the fourth time this season these two teams met, with Giants playing the three previous games.
The first round of Dwyer takes place in the fourth minute at 3:35 with a pass from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford taking the step while Beauvillier doubles the advantage four minutes later.
In that period of opening with a lot of action, Sullivan returned to the team playing in his country back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquartt passed to Cownie at 15:16 that brought the same score for the two teams.
Dwyer ensures that Giants gets advantage until the first stage of the game when he makes his second round of night at the end of the first period.
The team playing in a reunited country and again with Bouchard’s health these again reached the other team with a strong gowl at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined to help Nielsen give Dundee an advantage for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and ensure the winning with the fifth goal for his team in the last half period.
Giants, who now lose four of their last five games, will play in their country against Milton Keynes in their next game next week.
Air Traffic Control Dead to ensure that hundreds of people on the Konu plane can escape from the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered to be a hero after he died to ensure that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people managed to safely land.
More than 800 people died and many died after a great earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi last week, which struck tsunamis.
Strong tensions continued to dominate the area and many were trapped in Debris in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues' efforts to save, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the control towers which were flying at Palu Airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained calm in order to ensure that Batik Air, then on the run, was able to safely fly.
He then crossed the traffic control towers when he thought it was being reported.
He died later in the hospital.
The statement to Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that the likely decision saved hundreds of lives, ABC News of Australia reported.
We're preparing a helicopter from Balikipan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger space in another town.
Unfortunately he left early in the morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"When we heard about this felt a lot of debt," he added.
However, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands with the agency for mitigating the country’s disasters says access to the cities of Doghía, Siggi and Butung is limited.
"It has been estimated that the number is still increasing because many animals were still undercover while many could not reach," said the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The tower that reached up to six metres lay to Palu, where tomorrow the Red will be finished by mass.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusumuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance introduced the body.
Clean water is waste.
Ministries are becoming increasingly fragmented."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help those who are still alive but we don't know what to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can go worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu Al-Qad and said to the country's military: "We have asked all of you to work night and day to complete any evacuation-related task.
Ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was first contacted this year by terrorists in Lombok where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane incident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the plane incident in Laguna
The airline that had been operating on a flight that had been stolen in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says that a man is missing, after saying that the 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the approaching plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, she could not give details about where one man passenger was located.
The airport said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local noises helped to save passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water when trying to land on the Chuuk Island airport.
The official said that seven of the people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in a stable condition.
What caused the incident and the exact sequence of events remained unclear.
The U.S. Naval line and fleet they both said that the Dutch plane was in the harbor a little away from the route.
Some witnesses thought the plane was over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane went very low.
"This is a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others succeeded in passing from high to low water until the emergency exit on the flying plane.
He said that flight assistants were panicking and waving, and that he suffered from small corrosion in a race.
The United States Naval Fleet said that the seamen who were working near to improve well also helped in the rescue by using opening forces to transport passengers to the coast before the plane hit about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network indicates that in the last two decades 111 people died in PNG-registered airline incidents but no incident involved Air Niugini.
Analyst presents a nighttime schedule containing a pregnant woman
The 7th prosecution concluded its evidence on the case in the new man's process that was charged that in 2014 a woman from Mississippi died while she was alive.
The U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett has spent hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the mobile records to collect information on the movements of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis convention and the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19-year-old, on the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on that night that he died, which contradicts his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the mobile data showed that he was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and witnessed that he was not in town at the time.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that night was in Sanford's track, Sanford said it was "dwelling, because my track was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies were that Tellis said he had known Chambers for two weeks when he died.
The mobile records indicated that they knew each other only for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the messages, telephones and contact information of Chambers from his mobile phone.
"He took it out of his life," said Hale.
The defence is scheduled to start its closing arguments on Friday.
The judge said he expected the process to pass to the jury later that day.
The High Width: What is hip hop conjugation?
Three hip hop artists have to challenge the negative gender perspective by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, argues that the hip hop goes beyond its origin of political messages and is addressing social issues.
They have to go back to its roots and make the hip hop popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen recent re-enactments in the United Kingdom with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nanny from NY buys you a copy of it after a "racist" message.
Nanny from New York is getting you a copy for a discriminatory check after she received an error message from the mother who was saying she was "another black person."
The couple refuse to be racist, and compare the case with "storage."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed regret when she learned that the new adoptive person, Giselle Maurice, was a blind beggar when she arrived for the first working day in 2016.
"LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPERSUNA OTHER SEWDA," wrote Ms. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of being sent to her husband, she was sent to Mrs Maurice twice.
After her obvious mistake, Plasco-Flaxman hit her "done" and broke up with Mrs Maurice, where she said that her former nanny, who was African-American, did not do well and instead was waiting for the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Ms Maurice paid for her one work day and then sent her home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is looking after the couple for compensation in respect of the discharge, and is asking for compensation of $350 a day for the six-month live-in position for which she was initially employed, although without a contract.
I want to show them, my name, you can't do such things," he said to Post this week, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple attacked statements that were racist, saying that Ms Maurice's rejection was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"But I sent her something she didn't have the intention to say.
I don't know.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco said to Post.
"But if you trust your children in someone who spoke with the goff, even if it was wrong?
Your baby?
I'm coming."
When the case was related to "storsion", Plasco said they had only spent two months since March had the baby and was found "in a very difficult situation".
"Are you going to blame anyone like that?
It is not a pleasant thing to do," says the investment banker.
While the legal case is still under way, the court of the public opinion soon announced to the couple on social media, where they were insulted for their conduct and logic.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not relate to oral speech
Bond’s statement, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the pocket of someone who is reading for the first time before it was published.
"It is very interesting that we now know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the book of children from small games, certainly would have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book publication was "happy but somewhat tedious" after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was proud of his potential success although he never talked about it.
"He was rather a quiet man, and was not filled with himself," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like when you had a child to get something: be proud of them even if you didn't get something.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in that way.
Although he was his creation and imagination, he always thanked Paddington himself."
Binti was dying and I had given her the last Muslim on the phone
When a girl was suddenly taken by Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctor worked to save her life but it was all for no reason.
"Nothing was going on regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, which was not expected to live," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a phone call from Nad to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had given him the last Muslim.
And that's what I did.
I did, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
Be with you immediately.
Be with you.
The medicines prescribed by the doctor to keep her heart free were decreasing and slowly leaving her system.
She had died a little time before and started screaming everything.
All I can do is sit down and wait, knowing that this is happening.
I couldn't be angry or intruded or left because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it back."
As a result, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, who has so far remained behind for the loss of her leg, arrived on the plane together with the other passengers - who did not know about the difficult situation she had experienced.
"No one knew," she said.
"As low roots, and noise began to rain all the time.
It was hard to explain, but there was on the plane that I felt a great sense of compassion toward Nad.
That he needed my love and to forgive.
I know how much he loved her."
Place of women's cards written to avoid suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost someone guilty of suicide are working to prevent others from taking away their hands.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiration messages and telephone numbers that people can model for support.
Tyler, the son of Ms. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want no parent to hear what I feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old, living in Lydney, said that she was promising cocaine with infectiousitis.
"Everyone knew about his addiction.
They were always saying that his shirt was wearing each room."
However, he had to quit his job before he died, because he was found "in a very fashionable place."
In 2014, Tyler, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he had told him himself.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm always afraid this will be the cause of another promising event."
Ms. Davis created the cards, "to inform people that there are people who can open your heart to them or meet them, even if they are friends.
Don't put it in silence - you need to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs Davies, died to Mark, her friend for 15 years, not too long after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or so," she said.
"A few days before the Millennium we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Wednesday it was very bad - when the children opened their gifts they didn't have any contact with them with his eyes or anything like that."
She said his death was a great tragedy for them, but they have to fight it: "Let go of it in the family.
Tifridna.
But as much as we need to keep on living and fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is in a precarious situation as the FBI begins its investigation
"I say, if we could find something like what the committee was asking for -- limited time research, limited in scope -- maybe we could bring a few units," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that the committee was "blowing" among the partial paralysis that opened the hole.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican parties not want the FBI to investigate?
Their sovereignty is all due to the choice of time.
The half-term elections are only five weeks away on 6 November - if, as expected, the Republicans do not go well, in that case they will strongly weaken in their attempts to impose on the men they want to vote in the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was on the phone to meet the senators, to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met with Mrs. Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently in office.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, Vice-President, to vote and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean deserters for South Korea decreased from Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, South Korea's legislator said.
While quotaing data from the Ministry for the Unification of the Lower Side, Park Byeong-seug said that last year there was 1,127 changes in the party - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates that were demanding human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of the above-mentioned deserts are also offered to South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul says that by the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border.
Many of them go through China, which has border crossings with North Korea and is easier to share when compared to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) highly protected between the two parts of Korea.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often send them back to their country by force.
The relations between the North and the South - which are technically still in war - have significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for workshops focused on the stage of the denuclearisation negotiations.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards the Korean peninsula free of nuclear danger.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho took part in the United States sanctions for the lack of progress made since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, in no way will we be the first to unilaterally take up arms," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "external," saying he is unable to work in the Supreme Court
The Chamber's Minority Exxiencies Nancy Pelosi called on the person appointed to the Supreme Court Mr. Brett Kavanaugh "external" and said he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because of his temporary conduct.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday in Texas Tribunal Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't have thought that if a woman had never brought herself in such a way, they would have said "sterically," Pelosi said about her reaction to the witness of Kavanaugh before the Fifth Century Judicial Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally broke the allegations he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were young.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes even crying and excited when he was talking about his family and the years of his secondary school.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling for allegations against him "agrotesque and co-ordinated character killing" organised by Liberals who are rebuffed that Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as he had shown that he had prejudged against the Democrats.
"I think it qualifies him for those statements and the way he is behind the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was found when asked whether he was trying to accuse Kavanaugh if it was confirmed, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say something -- if he is not telling the Congress or the FBI the truth, he is not able, not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also to be in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Court of Appeal of D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat it was thought about the potential decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since it was considered conservative.
In its confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether it would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not in a place where a person with strict prejudices goes to the court and expects us to say, "Very well," Pelosi said.
And women must exercise their Authority.
It is a just verbal attack, months and years filled with anger, and it cannot say what it should say without delay.
"We stayed when we were dating," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"We don't think this is a rare thing, what do you say?"
She added, "I have a lot of women who had been caught in some other place, who said that she was also staying when she was upset, but a technical development that meant that when she was crying and started to stay, she was telling the person she was talking to, "Probably she thinks she's tired because she's staying.
They're robbed."
And then you didn't stop.
And I thought it was something brilliant."
The kiss is allowed as a way to express its great anger in part because of the fundamental interpretation of these wrongs.
One of my most clear memories of one of the first jobs I had, in a man-dominated office, where once I found myself feeling angry unrecognizable, was when an older woman grabbed me from the neck of a knife - a wild manager who always counted a little of it - and carried me to the store.
"You must let them see you still," I said.
"I don't know you're upset.
They think you're tired and they're happy to make you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Democratic Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was going out for presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was married outside the marriage on a bond known as Monkey Business and out of the election, Ms. Schroeder, very angry, concluded that there was no reason why she did not explore the idea of issuing herself for the presidential election.
"This was not a well thought-out decision," I said 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who were going out for the election, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and Seven Nani."
Since it was at the end of the campaign, it was back in the fund collection, and therefore it would not have been out for the election if it did not make $2 million.
A good fighter's gonna give me a break.
She found that some of her participants who were giving $1,000 to the men were only giving her $250.
"They think I'm doing something like that?" she said.
When she made her speech where she said she was not going to launch a formal campaign, she was so excited - thanks to the people who supported her, angry with the system that made it so difficult to collect funds and to target voters rather than delegates, and angry with the sexist - she was touched.
"Probably an account thinks I have strong barriers," recalled Mrs. Schroeder on how the media responded to her call.
"I think Kleineex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would you write about my age?
"Hi bikiet?"
How trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The number of U.S.-China air-opening bombs had been dropped, and while the battle was still under way to stop, a lack of agreement between countries could be of benefit to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, first warned this year earlier by taxing Chinese main exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminium.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting items amounting to $200 billion (£150 billion), and in fact taxing all goods entering the United States from China.
Beijing has been irradiated each time in the same way, while more recently it has been presenting five to ten per cent of US$60 billion of goods.
China has promised to agree with the United States every time, and it is unlikely that the second largest world economy will survive in the near future.
The fact that Washington is taking a step back means to accept requests, but publicly the fact that China leaves the United States will be too enraging for Xia Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that, if Beijing works wisely, U.S. trade pressures can positively support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions which start economic chaos in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what the spectators have recognised before," said Abigail Grace, a research partner who focuses on Asia's New American Security Center, which is a reflection group.
Syria has a "prepared" that refugees return, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country affected by war that lasted more than seven years.
When speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today's situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas torn by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of the unilateral terrorism and economic measures aimed at their daily lives and their lives.
The UN believes that since the war started in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country.
Six million other people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian regime is calling for help to rebuild the country concerned.
However, it is stressed that it will not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsoring the settlement.
Europe takes over Ryder Cup in Paris
A team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018 against Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National abroad Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not been able to send Ryder Cup to Europe since 1993.
Europe again won the title when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn team reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
Phil Mikkelson, who is retired in the United States, who spent the entire tournament, gave his ball in water at the 16th floor for 3, and thus gave his game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian Molinari golfer jumped in all its rounds, and 1 out of 4 players who had never brought 5-0-0 from the beginning of the current tournament format in 1979.
The US Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against the ruler of the minimum European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest-level player, Dustin Johnson, responded 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England who played in his final Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain Sergio Garcia became the best European tournament player ever here at 25.5 points throughout his career.
" Normally I don't leave but today I haven't kept it.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he chose me and that he believed in me.
I'm very happy, very happy to find the tax back.
The team is all over, and I am glad I was able to help," said Garcia excited after the European win.
He passes the cake to his compatriot friend John Ram who won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles play Sunday.
"The incredible pride I heard, that I beat Tiger Woods, when I pushed after him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a record of Ryder Cup 13-21-3 throughout his career.
Strange statistics of one of the best players who ever was here, who won 14 main titles, the second only after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the whole weekend finding those parts of the course where golf is played with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disgruntled performance for his team, "I'm proud of these men, they're fighting.
There was a time tomorrow when we saw some pressure on Europe.
Argumentary.
Thomas was greeted by the hat.
He's a very good captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We're going to get together again, I'm going to work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're going ahead.
To these 12 young people I love them and I am proud that I'm captain.
You have to tie the cap and shake.
I played better than she."
