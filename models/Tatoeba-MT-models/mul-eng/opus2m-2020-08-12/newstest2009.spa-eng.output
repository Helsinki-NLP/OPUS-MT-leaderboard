The Prague Box ended with less points at the end of the day
After the sudden fall of the morning, the Prague Bolsa repaired its losses.
ČEZ operations reached approximately half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Bolsa, at the beginning of the commercial march, reacted immediately to the fall of the moon when it fell about 6 per cent.
The down this time is due to the downturn on Wall Street.
The market reaction is also expressed here before the outcome of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives who refused to support the Stabilisation Plan of the Secretary of the financial sector.
Reduction of actions in Asia
The actions of the Asian Bolsheviks were a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although throughout the day the index finally suffered part of the losses.
Hong Kong's Hong Kong Hong Kong's Hang Seng Bottle Index has marked almost four per cent, although later it reduced its losses by a decrease of almost 2.5 per cent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises' index following the movements of Chinese actions in the Hong Kong Bottle declined by 3.8 per cent, while in Shanghai markets were closed.
The activities of the Sidney Bolza were more than five per cent lost, but in the end the losses fell to 4.3 per cent.
Taiwan's Bolsa, according to the Secretary of the Index, fell to 3.6 per cent.
"The rescue actions planned in the U.S. are unsafe and this affects the financial market all over the world," said the Chief of the Hong Kong Monetary Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, i.e. regardless of the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong rates of interest are at the same level as those of the United States.
American legislators should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and adopt a support proposal for the financial system.
In other words, it threatens that falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American actions
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial system aid plan to which $700 billion should be spent (about 12 billion dollars).
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
On Monday, American actions lived a bloody bathroom and mainly the stock index collected the largest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell to almost seven percent. A similar volume fall was last registered in 1987.
The index came down before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the proposal of the assembly was not going forward, the index began to fall free.
The convention is withdrawn: The U.S. government can inject $700 billion into the bank
The highest representatives of the Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a long-term agreement on financial assistance to the American financial system.
Your vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
American legislators have created a break in the discussions on the adoption of the redemption plan in its form to assist the US financial system with the amount of 700 billion dollars (about 12 billion crowns).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must finalize some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and vote.
The financial system assistance plan will be discussed on Monday at the Assembly of Representatives.
He said on Sunday to the Reuters agency, Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee on Financial Services and the Bank of the Assembly.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the redemption plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, "delight" will be achieved through the complex mechanisms which will also help the market in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've made great progress.
We have resolved our discrepancy views on how the market stability package should be packaged" commented Democrat Nancy Pelosia to Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Thursday night with finance minister Henry Paulson to give him a final form to the Government Fund.
This should buy from financial companies non-saled mortgage assets that lead to losses to financial firms and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective in the market.
It is necessary to continue with the healing plan, but I think we're already in it," said Paulson.
A Sign for Asian Business
The global financial crisis has an explicit impact on the fast-paced action market.
According to Senator Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are doing their best to finally approve an agreement this Sunday.
They therefore want to calm investors' business before the Asian financial market, since they are the ones in the first hour and where Congress could influence the trade in the moon.
However, for now there is no clear certainty as to when the two cameras of the United States Congress will vote and not even if they are not in the last moment with any problem.
The legislators believe it will be approved in the next few days.
The law, however, will suffer a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
However, the Congress could block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the programme did not fulfil its function, which would be $100 billion in other dollars and, later on, $350 billion in the last.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the President may vote in favour of this decision but the Congress may vote in favour of a majority of the votes cast.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the programme was to earn financial resources for the recovery of mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying their mortgages.
"We've worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives should be prepared to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the progress of the Saturday and that he values "the commitment of both parties to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy".
Limitation of the blinding contract
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, chief of the negotiators, said that the legislators had decided on the responsibility of the programme's money to protect the taxpayers' taxes from their losses, a relief clause from the programmed financing plan.
The new law should also limit the so-called blind contracts for directors of participating companies of the programme and establish a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This should be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made great progress towards the agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance to house owners who have problems with their payments.
The Government should agree with the new mortgage payments that it purchases in order to reduce monthly charges for debt payments to creditors and allow them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological assistance
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance's chief economist, David Marek, a good idea that will be carried out but quite difficult.
"And that's why you don't know what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be bought.
This will be crucial for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
That the plan is now adopted or at the beginning of next week is not so relevant, according to Marek.
"More importantly, this week the congressmen agree on their support and in their well-being before they can.
This important and psychological agreement to achieve this approval is, at these times, the most important one," Marek insisted.
Hand-held fight: MP3 Player against mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile player plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
What seems to be more obvious is that it's better to buy only the phone.
There are still enough reasons for man to get only the player.
The choice depends practically on the way it is used and the requirement of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult to get the most modern tochakes to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
On the other hand, this type of music products such as LP discs are no longer available, and with regard to their quality there is no single objective reason to continue buying them.
If the vinyl discs with art rock, jazz or blues are wrapped in their shelves, they are probably dreaming, at least, with this type of tocadisks.
This is the same with music that is on the way, i.e. compressed, simplified music - the music in MP3.
And here there are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly test the marketcases of twenty crowns.
Two extremes, including enough space for each one.
The selection is wide.
Also decides the duration of the battery
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even what even most mobiles do.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Faced with the most important functions such as calling, sending messages, you can play music and video, write both, have a better or worse camera and even be able to navigate.
And when we take into consideration the smartphone and the PDA will also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a little miracle because no one ever knows how to do a puzzle and no television can take pictures.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
How many more functions are used on the mobile before the screen indicator is lit and requested to be reloaded.
And music playing is one of the biggest energy tracks.
Few are mobiles that can play music more than ten or twelve hours, most much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) are clearly more performance.
Therefore, be aware that cheap mobile phones will not play more than two hours.
If, in addition to this, they call on them constantly to still get, for more security, a loader for work - this is also valid for the most expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, since even the worst will take at least 9 hours of continuous operation after a job.
Another problem is when you write music on the phone.
Unfortunately only one part of the devices has a universal USB connection and, in addition, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some wireless reading units can connect the small memory cards used in mobile phones.
In players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Simply fill the device with music through the computer's USB.
Most mobile phones and players only create their order in the music library by the name of the interpreter, title of the album, gender or also by user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with tree structure like a Windows Searcher and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Player tries to use, mobile knows more
For the selection of a particular team interested in the resistance of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its management.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you will listen to it every day for just one moment, like in the tram, then you'll have enough with any mobile that plays.
What practically gets any mobile.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the cell phone or player plays music.
MP3 plays it all and, practically, almost all the music that comes to you will be in this format.
There are among the most extensive and excluding him the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
The smallest include the AAC format (format used by Apple and its iPod).
Best mobile phones also allow for, for example, online music purchases.
Simply through the mobile internet visit the operator’s competent pages (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could only be a weight argument for buying a cell phone for music.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is poor and most are limited only to the successful escape of radios.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless Internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always take up a cell phone.
Whenever you like to listen to something, the mobile will be in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether it always takes a few hearing aids or at least one hand-free.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile, even at least one MP3 player.
Probably the greatest advantage for many of the mobile with music will be your price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns can already buy a good walkman.
Most of you will limit them to the absence of an entry for classical auriculars.
The best, including with regard to the technical part, such as telephones equipped with a 3.5 mm input for classical hearing aids, cost up to five thousand.
Again, the advantage of players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - really manage any person.
The minimum functions, their management like the previous current tapes or also the tocadisks are obvious.
It is not a threat in the sense that we are mistakenly connected to the internet with the mobile and therefore giant account for data loss.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of an appropriate card, it will reach the two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
Basic models are usually equipped only with a 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the most expensive have an 8-GB memory.
If you already have a cell phone and you want to buy a free MP3 player yet, you have an audience at Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to capacity (up to 2 GB) there is no need to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If it is considered among the most demanding lovers of music the hand of the most specialized mobile walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as the one of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman-line mobiles have almost identical use as one of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category as price, over four thousand crowns, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulation (usually 15 hours, with maximum performance up to 35 hours), the most mentioned brand would bring MP3 players.
The first virtual operator is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, we still need something here - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
He's probably not gonna be late for it.
That Czech operators are part of Europe's most expensive ones, we have already written it on mobile.cz.
The rest also confirmed it by the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTU), which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country was the most expensive of all the Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in the regulation of roaming rates, it is likely to be in a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators the SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking competence that really wants to fight.
This is probably paradoxical, because we have three mobile networks and its high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is an extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvorák, also said there was no room in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It may be true that for a classic operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find any frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Exactly the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brings a significant drop in prices before which classical operators should also react.
At the same time, before the entry of tigers such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market in Great Britain, similar voices were heard both there and here.
There has been evidence that there is room for this type of operator and that they can be successful.
Moreover, there is no need to look for examples too far.
In February of this year we inform you about the stranger of the virtual mobileking operator in Poland.
As soon as half a year later, this operator was able to obtain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking is the Penta group that, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is to focus on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order for them to function effectively, they are sufficient with many less clients than a classic operator.
They do not bear relatively high costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, this type of virtual operators are usually profiled with low costs - offering cheap SMS calls and messages that, however, often contradicts the offer of more suitable services.
Thus, for example, mobile tesco in Great Britain offers SMS at least half of the prices with regard to competition.
However, as the example of Mobiling in Poland shows, it can also be a good hit by a tragic group of targets.
This operator is specifically addressed to the man.
"The right man to choose Mobilking - is the operator who likes and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if I feel as if Poland could be involved in our country.
There is no doubt that Vodafone's spokesman, Miroslav Čepicky, said: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments where most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the provision of services is relatively satisfactorily satisfied"
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be any virtual operator in the Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the R. Checa does not seem too promising.
It is better to launch Mobilking in other countries of our region," said in a telephone conversation for mobile.cz, Jana Studničková, a spokesman for the Penta financial group.
He indirectly ensured that current mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything they can so that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the Novera GTS Group that would want to take a further step towards becoming a real competition from Telephonica O2 in the field of business clients.
"We have a great interest in that, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed telephone services but also mobile phones.
And as soon as possible, better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly met with all Czech mobile phone operators.
With some of them we have made progress at the meetings," the group's spokesman Pavel Kaidl said.
Then maybe they're spending better time.
It seems that, for non-official information, the first official operator would have to reach the end of the year.
But for now your appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At these moments we believe that the situation is suitable for the appearance of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with some complex and serious project in this area," said for mobile.cz, Vlastimil Sršeň, portuguese of Telefónica O2.
Other operators refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
The voice of T-mobile Martina Kemrová, in line with O2's opinion, adds: "We have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to develop."
And it adds: "In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this point we should already have on the table some concrete contract that could be studied in such short terms."
Vodafone focuses more on the performance of the own requirements of a 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepicky adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this is about spending and infrastructure.
This is exactly what we view as the greatest contribution from the customer perspective.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is in the company with which to set up a shared network for a quick internet on the mobile."
Offices responsible - with union operators and meat
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a low price and thereby a decrease in profits.
Then why facilitate entry into competition?
When operators want to achieve something, they are able to draw from the same memory, proof of that is the agarron when U:fon came up.
Maybe the biggest pressure on CTU was at the time of U:Fon by T-Mobile company.
This is the public information available on the CTU web pages.
But exactly now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds: "In addition, it is not much that the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened to a room operator.
With regard to the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would be subject to him and, above all, his large requirements."
That is why this access to mobile operators is extremely discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of the CTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in trade bids, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Claims (UOHS).
However, this expressed its typical position against this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile phone operator and a virtual operator has been concluded.
No agreement has been concluded so far since the offer of the most interested potentials was not sufficiently interesting for classical operators," added our Christian Chalupa, of the UOHS External Relations Department.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For offices to represent consumers' interests, it is more than a consideration, but it should be noted that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Christian Chalupa adds: "In the abroad where virtual operators work normally we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices of mobile phone services"
Clearly, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the low prices are not within the interest of the EAGGF.
It's really dramaticly shocking in all this case, it's hard to see the dissuasive reactions that come from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a case is offered by itself.
It is the same with the price of gasoline in gasoline because it is clear that it is a work of opportunity and a hard fight for competition.
"The Office in this regard has not found signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators therefore have a dominant position, they do not have a corresponding increase of responsibility in their actions on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, but they are missing, as well as telecom regulators," he added to his reply Chalupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many conflicting points.
It is clear that there is a relevant market analysis developed by the CTU that telecoms are from the point of view of the commercial tendering of a single market.
In this type of market, of course none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another view - in order for a virtual operator to arise, it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile phone operator - with all his logic - has the monopoly of his network.
Therefore, in a concrete segment it should be necessary to be dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for UOHS should be a warning that three mobile operators arrive in a similar manner.
The current complaints of stakeholders (including the so-called GTS Novera company) show that in all negotiations with operators there are many similar obstacles.
Loading responsibility in the CTU is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications which the UOHS washes hands in all this matter.
We've already met him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately not long ago a new amendment to the Telecommunications Act was introduced to extend the CTU's competition in the field of non-competitive commercial tenders, even when a number of experts promised that the situation would improve.
This must be well known by the representatives of the UOHS, but it is clear that their interests are on the other side.
It's okay when nobody sees it.
At the same time, unfortunately, something continues to work as well as a pseudovirtual operator that in Czech mobile phone networks already exists a few.
They are companies that place their own prices on mobile phone services which, however, are only part of the public.
This is usually a business dedicated to multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a few chosen ones get the list of prices from these companies.
The magic is in which the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business client of the same company by carrying a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile phone operators prohibit that type of sale.
"If cases such as those mentioned could be identified as infringements under the terms of the contract which could be translated into the end of the collaboration with the company given," Martina Kemrová answered the question on this issue.
But it is quite unlikely that this type of activity carried out by mobile phone operators will not reach responsible people.
Exactly in the case of the three companies mentioned, thousands of customers can be treated.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they obtain nothing adverse and, at the same time, unlike the authentic virtual operators - they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepicky warns us of the possible problems: "The law allows a speculation of this type, however, the services of this company are only used by a delicacy of as many as one hundred customers.
These should also accept that your phone SIM card is not in your name because they can't afford it as a normal client of operators."
That is exactly what the CTU should think of at least foreign.
There is also a new question for UOHS.
If mobile phone operators are surrounded by eyes in this type of procedure, why are they blocking the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has sufficient competence to discover such activities and if it is not to be desired, it should not be satisfied with the explanations of operators that they have no idea of this history and that their commercial conditions do not permit it.
When we're gonna stop being the most expensive
As already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market leads to a significant decrease in service prices.
At the same time, in almost every country where the virtual operator emerged, classical operators tried to protect themselves from this degradation.
The arguments used by these were practically all identical - too small, a market, possibly too satisfactorily, problems with service quality, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulatory bodies have intervened at this time and in no case defended operators but their clients.
They have already achieved that the first virtual operator will arise and that others will be born with him.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory body is all of this as if it were a burning key.
For our experience we cannot fail to be impressed that the confusion of the terms of reference in these cases agrees with them.
But we don't want to.
If this information between carriers is correct and the virtual operator really comes to these countries, then the Czech mobile phone market is probably beginning to move again.
If any of the operators stop accessing any virtual mobile phone operator, it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling dearer than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Himno has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official Humno.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new official recording of the Donde hymn, my home.
The new hymn captured the Orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bélohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are solos, one male voice and the other female voice, one with Coro and another instrument.
Part canto encargan Katery's Prince and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the heavenly arrangements are Otakar Jeremiaháš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to the four versions.
Bälohlävek considers this national Czech song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio has already said before it deliberately selected for the Singers alone with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the outset I have also tried with the two and then, also, with the Coro to be established in the speech so that the text would be well understood, so that it would be consensual," he said.
The Czech official hymn celebrates the next year's 175 anniversary.
The song Donde, my Home was first sung in 1834 at the State Theatre tables in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetan Tyl and arranged with the music of Frantisjek Škroup.
He won popularity and people made it their own.
The first stroph of the song after the birth of Czechoslovakia in 1918 was naturally converted into a part of the official hymn.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hemno sounds
Prague MHD takes us Wednesdays for the first time with the chip
The Wednesday, 1 October 2008, is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company on the date when the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be acquired at these times by almost one hundred thousand people who have the Opencard chip card.
The passengers can buy the 30-day bonus, 90-day bonus and the year (it will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time load it on their chip card at the information centres and stations of the transport company at the stations of Metro, Museum, Móstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Andrí, Roztyly, Latvia, Kobylisy, Rajská Zahrada, Kacherov and Luka.
The tickets can be purchased from yesterday online on the transport company's pages, www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred people until evening.
Those who start using the Internet as a trading form can definitely start to forget about the ticket sales posts in the metro stations, where until now they should regularly take out a normal ticket.
The bonus is purchased online, and the Opencard card is recharged in one of the branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is available to passengers a valve with staff prepared to help interested parties with online purchase and also with the recharge of the bonus bought on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus on the Opencard in the automatic shipping machines that are located in some of the meters.
How are these shipping machines?
They're red, they remind us of a pickup machine and the passengers will probably already be located at Roztyly, Budějoviká metro stations, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the city but at the end of the year there would have to be eight," Opatrný completed.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Just by inserting the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid bonus will only be charged on it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also around it.
That is, in the circuits and bus lines from 300 to 499 which are mainly used by residents of central Bohemia.
"In integrated Prague transport trains there are auditors equipped with a read-only card that will help confirm the validity of the time and zone of the bonus," explained the ticket control, Filip Drapal of the Ropid organization, which sets out the hours of the Prague collective transport.
Circulation buses have their reading cards mounted on the driver's cover.
On arrival it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany it with the Opencard in the location for which it is intended.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds there is nothing easier than to request the driver this information," Drapal completed.
Passengers who do not travel on the circulatory buses and do not remember when they are finished with their bonus validity can be directed to the shipping machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be presented with information about the validity of your document.
The South wanted to be part of the United States in a referendum
The Germans asked in 1945 that fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is drawn from the letter that is kept in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the pattern of the United States of America.
With this desire, some German groups of South Germans were directed to the President of the United States in 1945.
The result of the cards that are stored in a special file and that are now stored in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in a letter to the US President that does not allow the return of "the country of Shumava" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - again in Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we want your word that the American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators" is written in the letter, signed with a "people carrying the destiny of Shumava in their hearts."
Given that the union of Czechoslovakia with the South-West Germans assumes - according to these Czech national nature - only hope in brutality, neglect, incompetence, pressure and slavery, the authors appeal in the letter to the American President who takes it for granted today and forever to Shumava under a protection.
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, we are delivered to a foreign state that opposes and rejects minorities and that it is in full collaboration with the victory of the allies," writes the letter.
The reason why authors can't sign is too much the fear of "cheek oppressors" repressors.
If the President of the United States had too much doubt about this idea of the Germans of the woods, it would be sufficient to organize a referendum on whether their people want to be part of the U.S. or live under their patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of postwar history, can sound a little childish, some experts say, paints carefully the expectations of the Germans of the South-East then.
Although the Czech Germans should have hoped at least that they would be dealing with their expulsion from the Republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate for the Sudanese in a clear way of autonomy.
Others thought they'd stay in Czechoslovakia.
It was confirmed even by Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
This was in the war, as German of Budějovice, wrapped in the Baltic Sea.
When the war ended, the British appreciated him and placed him in Holstein's camp of ten German prisoners were there to teach him Czechs.
"They thought that when they returned home, the Czechs would welcome them," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, he said, expected that, on the basis of the Fines Decrees, they would be expelled from the Republic.
Don't think - pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most direct action in the Czech history is aimed at security on the streets.
In this way, it could be characterized by the emotional campaign that decided to launch Wednesdays the Ministry of Transport in the media.
The Minister's office, Aleš Rébiček, promises that it will dissuasate drivers of dangerous conduct to the volunteer.
The 150 million campaign will be heard on television, radio, cinema, Internet and leaflets.
It should dissipate the driver of high speed and alcohol to the flight.
And also to remind them that before they start, the centrons are cared for.
He wants to come to consciousness especially from young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and, ultimately, professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Basically human history that empathizes with emotions.
And for this we are witnessing the "sanguinary" announcements throughout the campaign:
Don't think - pay!
The word "Don't Think" is written with great letters in the matrix.
And in a blood truck there's the word "pays."
This should mean that a man at a time of dissipation can come to pay with his own life.
The ads are going to "fear" the spectators by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Angolan lands where strong images of victims of accidents can be observed.
It promises that this will reduce accidents and the number of deaths in the Czech streets.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and pellets for drivers
"For drivers the sugar and pelgo system is valid.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red soap is passed and so saves time.
The liego is a threat of penalty or accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risks," says hospital transport psychologist Na Homolce, Martin Kořán.
And that's why an information campaign is needed in the press and mainly a negative publicity, the psychologist concrete.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any installed panel warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver won't pay more attention to it," Körán warned.
Olmert would return almost all areas occupied for peace
The President of the Interim Government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, spoke on the return of practically all the lands occupied in 1967, namely, Cis Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Mountains, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
I proposed in the interview that the moon appeared in the newspaper Jedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we must reimburse almost all the lands (occupied) if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper.
"We will certainly be left with so many hundred of these lands, but we must give the Palestinians one hundred like (from the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in the event of restoration, Jerusalem would also be included.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or kidnappers to pass on his feet as he did to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed out regarding the two July attacks in the city where several dead and dozens of people were wounded.
According to the President it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple hill, a sacred and historical place" within the ancient city.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won't work," he insisted further.
Retirement of the Golan Highs
Olmert also spoke of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Mountains, which from his point of view is an inherent condition for a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also entail concrete efforts by Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to learn to win the Golan.
They will have to leave their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with the Hizbula (chitat movement), they will have to learn from the permanent support of Hamas (chitat movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Yihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the prime minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are bus drivers illegal?
The law is unknown, can't walk on a long bus
In relation to the tragic bus accident of the student agency near the Italian city of Padova, the question arises as to whether azafatas and passengers can move by the bus during the trip.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the Asaphate is opposed to the law of violent transit," says the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that took place last week in the twenty-year Asaphate was evidently caused by the driver of the truck only when the bus crossed the road.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the less secure area of the vehicle despite having reservations about two other sites.
However, the bus may have an accident or suddenly freeze, and at the right time the Asaphate distributes coffee or newspapers.
Here what's playing the paper is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permit, with foot-and-mouth places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
The bus from the student Agency's long distances do not have places to walk, which was confirmed by the company's director, Radim Jancúra, at Currentalné.cz.
"We have resolved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, this was withdrawn and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is on the way if they have a seat," he commented.
Azafata doesn't know the law
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the alphabet - no legal provision makes this function clear.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from carrying out any service.
The road transport law only knows the term of the Vehicle Reviewer whose rights and obligations are not defined," adds, less mysteriously, the spokesman Hanzelka.
The Director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorny, believes that the law is sufficiently sensitive to this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have foot-and-mouth sites.
That's all," she says.
Buses are divided between urban people, where there are places to stay at foot and maximum speed, interurbans with places to stay at foot with a higher speed permit and long distances without places to walk, with the maximum speed permit and with seating equipped with safety belt.
Like on the plane, the expert says
The BESIP security expert in transport, Jaroslav Horrín, sees no significant problems with the movement of the Asaphate on the bus.
"In the course of the development of the journey there is not much danger, the situation can be compared to the service on aircraft.
Even here there is the security that turbulence comes and that the azaphata can hit the head."
"However, if the bus suddenly freezes clearly that the physical laws are valid.
Same as on a urban bus or on the tram.
The safety of the Asaphate must solve it by the carrier's internal regulation," he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law this problem is unsolved.
Jancúra is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only transporter who offers the azafata service.
He's working on it for two hundred.
The Director, not after the accident, considers this work to be risky.
"However, at the moment you have the impression that the position of the Asaphate is at risk, then I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by passengers on arrival.
I would even save expenses," she says.
In the interest of security is the reason why Asiaa lacks azaphites in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, which leads a small line compared to SA.
"We don't have acephites, we've been against them since the beginning.
Before or after this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago for Týden.cz.
A Great Disaster Happened
In the accident of the line that one in Naples died a young Pilsen Asaph who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking car blocking the road to the bus. without using intermittents.
His driver tried in a quick manner to avoid him, however, he shot at the right side of the front.
Janchura refuses to sell the two sites that are reserved for the relief of the azafata.
"These sites can't be booked for long distance connections, they're blocked."
The company intends to request the driver of the vehicle.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the verdict on the compensation of the girl's family but also wait for the financial expenses of the debtor.
Reform of the law?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring more accuracy on the movement of azafata in the bus in which 30 experts from a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working for one year.
"However, no concrete conclusion has been reached.
They are not too dedicated to buses, but rather to the system of points, maximum speed in bus and mobile use during the trip," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the Asaphes to be an important threat to passenger safety," he concluded by the spokesman Hanselka that road safety control is the competence of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
Dusseldorf's hope is supported in Frankfurt
In the letter of the West LB bank's joint directive for its employees there are no major words.
The merger of the units of the Dusseldorf bank with the DEKA bank can form 'a central market of capital of the Spartassen financial group', as the paper says, published on Monday
The West LB bank, breaking the 'competition block' with sustainable benefit capacity, would enter such a business.
In addition, such mergers can be a starting point for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
This is how we understand the text when a joint directive wants to show the capacity to act in difficult times.
Because just as the West LB was previously under a huge pressure.
Not only from the part of the European Union, but also from the Federal Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services that recently made it clear to the Government of North-Westphalia that there is little time to find a solution.
For a while, also on the part of Frankfurt, there has been much talk about the union of such a kind between the DEKA bank, which the customers of Sparkasse know about their investment funds, and the West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, head of the DEKA bank, presented the data after a year and a half at the end of August, let me know that there is no sense in the bank's merger, located on Mainzer Street street, with a regional bank such as the Helaba or the West LB.
But the DEKA Management Board, which is now composed of the regional banks and associations of Sparkassen, commissioned a joint directive to start negotiations with the West LB on common commercial activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have just started, as is stated at the financial site.
This is not the first time it is about consolidation in the area of Sparkassen, the name of the DEKA bank appears which, with its 3000 employees, is among the most important businesses at the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003 the situation seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the Renania-Palatinado regional bank and Helaba.
This initiative to create a union of three parties remained unproductive.
Only plans were made public, Hesse ' s Government expressed opposition to Helaba ' s participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the Renania-Palatinado regional bank initiated a dialogue with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank.
But it was always played again with the idea of the merger of the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, the president of the Helaba Board of Directors, said he was against the plans of co-existence with his bank.
Regardless of this, it seems more clear that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
So when the elections of the Bavarian Parliament are about to take place, the BayernLB Union with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For Helaba that does not necessarily bring good news.
If the pressure continues to fusion will increase, Helaba will lack the partners to do so.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although so far it has been much better than the financial crisis that the residents of Stuttgart and Munich have done.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which has 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year, avoided the plans of co-operation with the West LB.
In any case, only the North LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections are just one part.
On the other hand, it is the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a commercial model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end you can decompose the West LB, but that, of course, is not the bank's own will.
Thus, also in the letter from the bank's joint directive it is said that a complete solution would be sought for the entire bank.
As you can combine the co-existence between individual parts of the bank with the DEKA, that will show time.
The second weekend of Octoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time, he attended Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5 litres of brand Kaiser beer barrel is built a huge bone tiger that shows nearly 200 participants from Oktoberfest who sound low enough to produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a date, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the train station Porta Nuova, this night at 23:45 three buses leave, `Direction Munich, the festival of beer', expected to arrive at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are expected especially for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
On one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag are singing the Americans, they've already begun to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who takes a long coat with an artificial leather ring and gloves with silver sheets, belongs to these buses.
Five years ago they came to Oktoberfest, bearing in mind that there are only three excursions this year.
From night on the road to there, during the day on the beach, at 22.30 p.m.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer made under the Bahiare Cleaning Act, sickness insurance and German guide- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
By night the buses are already on their way to the bus with the direction "Brenner"
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon the Queen's quiet on the bus, the passengers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the strength.
It goes to Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian matrix take another break on the 8th road shortly before Munich.
Finally, when the group of Marco has the expected arrival at 6.30 in the parking lot next to the Plaza de Teresa, there are now about 50 other buses throughout Europe.
Elena, Luca and others meet together, Marco has his last talk on how to proceed.
First: Put a yellow gorilla on.
There, on the left is written "Oktoberfest", on the gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the Internet: "conscersivaggiado.it".
Second: "When the doors are opened from the camp shop, that means walking!" cry Marco in the morning.
"Mark!" Mark and occupy the back places in the camp shop.
"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block them, and all with yellow gorillas don't sit in the same bathroom, separated by all space!"
One litre of beer, please Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Do Not Forget Your Own
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
Just get out of your place, he'll be busy!"
Third: "This afternoon exactly the 10-and-a-half of you have to come here!" Do you understand?
And now they're all going to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the road, up to the marble gorges in the trees, traffic signals and even in a cartel of the elections of a large People's Party in Bavaria.
You want to be able to recognize the path back.
It's the second weekend of Octoberfest known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no accurate data on the number of people; this is 50,000 people who travel over the Alps and are unfortunately entering the camps, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend in Italy.
The Munich police receive assistance from seven police officers from the autonomous province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers assist the Red Cross of Bavaria, which makes a statistics of the present nations, where Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, are first in front of English (about 60 assistance) and Austrians.
The best store in the Italian campaign is so called Hofbruzelt.
Nights without sleep for believers in the Real State Hypo
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, and last week the Federal Minister of Finance Peter Steinbrück stressed it.
However, that policy would use the word "relatively" and added that the German banking area would also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the end of the week.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the Munich real estate funder, which is co-financed in the DAX index, receives from a German bank consortium a thousand million credit to make it possible to resist turbulence on the market.
On Monday a person who knows the situation well told Reuters: credit aid rose to EUR 35 billion.
The part of the capital that the Real Estate Hypo is going to use has to take an interest.
Money comes from private banks as well as from public law.
The cause is the losses of the Defa branch.
According to one report, state finances with the money provided for long-term projects have only been financed for a short period of time - which is now no longer possible because of market mistrust.
In the first half of the year, the bank's actual capital reserve fell by 95 per cent, EUR 2.37 million, and the share of its own capital dropped slightly from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
In comparison with the same period last year, the continued income from financial investments and net profits of financial transactions fell to zero, the income from the taxpayers and some securities were also below 70 per cent, in EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the high and many revenues from reimbursement of the costs of the restructuring of the former Defa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the federal tax code and the business organised for the consortium companies, the negative balance could lead to a deficit of approximately 16 per cent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state finance was initially lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which served as a reason for the establishment of the Aerospace Bank.
Since it was not possible to earn much money with the financing of state projects, the Defa began to dedicate itself actively to projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of Community projects by private investors as well as state (Private-Ppublic-Partnership PPP) and it was diversified.
Now the Real State Hypo has to make amortizations about the value of the branch that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated account of the group's losses and gains, it is said very precisely.
It's a fact that dividends have canceled.
By 2007 they had already been cancelled to two thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa, the Real State Hypo became an important state and financial financial financial asset in the area of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own client deposits, it, compared with other banks, becomes more dependent on the refinancing in the interbank market.
With the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, what happened two weeks ago, the grant of interbank loans was essentially low because banks were saving their liquidity.
Each year, the Real Estate Hypo needs nearly EUR 50 billion to finance a part of the Defa credit cards of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a credit the need to finance the group for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of international monetary markets which are now largely out of operation"
Other sources say that, thanks to this money, refinancing is guaranteed by the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, president of the Hypo Real Estate Board, explained that the Real State Group would not need the monetary markets for the foreseeable time.
The German Central Bank and the Federal Institute for the Supervision of Financial Services (BaFin) form part of the basis for ensuring the competitiveness of the Real State Group from now on.
That must be expected by shareholders and bank creditors.
But because of the dynamics and immeasurableness of the crisis there is no continuance.
Even it is imaginary that no funding should be needed in its full volume.
But the opposite case cannot be excluded.
It was the voice that the bank was still almost insolvent in the last hour of Sunday, so temporary rescue can also not rest by least concerned people.
The stock price fell to 75 per cent, EUR 3.30.
The loan courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While the priority debt is almost unchanged, the rates of loans according to the position in the property register are clearly low.
In particular, loans from the former Württemberg Hypo branch are affected and are due to the loans whose profits are based on 2009.
After the marked increase in the banking crisis and the acquisition of the Defa affected the Real State Hypo, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While banks, governments and banks that are less affected are still ready to support the system, while pension amortization can be started within a period of time.
Or something will happen, which is not likely to be imagined by anyone -- the financial crisis will be over in the next 15 months.
But when we saw the news on partial statistics, now the security that is at its limit became a justifiable hope.
That will be a reason, for believers will spend the night without sleep, breaking their head on the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
In the short term investors can still put the end point and use transport to re-account for losses for future tax payments for the change in the future.
Sylvana and Bent's Secrets?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to appear at Tachibana High School, the girls began to re-yellow: Germany is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on the exchanges she accounts for Japan.
"The first day at a college in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to college, I was scared.
I live on the coast of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and train 40 minutes to High School Tachibana.
I just had to find the way, so I didn't miss it.
It seems that the beginning of the classes has not been set as strictly as in my home in Baja Sajonia.
From eight in the morning the students came, at nine o'clock they started a small meeting with teachers, the 'human room'.
Before I started class, I had been touched to introduce myself.
Besides, I'm not a person who speaks with great interest in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform, I got an old faggot from my host family's mother and also a blue blouse, blue calcium and black skin shoes.
So this dress put me in the pocket and I tried to say everything in the right way: "Sayonara Wo She Sylvana..." - I'm called Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in one week I'll be my clients.
At this point I was very happy because I had been studying this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have kissed, laughed and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my Mangas.
It belongs to the Japanese girls' survival vocabulary and means "mona, beautiful"
Then I quickly got out of my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when I heard the gong, I really felt excited.
They all spoke at the same time, they reigned and asked many questions - at the same time it became very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then in the rest everyone took out their Bentos.
The mother of my family also hosted a Lanchbox for me - is something else that is boring pieces of German bread.
It had rice with herbs, small sauces, pepper salad and algae, fruit and something like meat in the tofu mass.
In most cases I have no idea what's like here in Japan.
Things are rare and they have a new taste.
What's safe is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of marinated surgeons in the living room, buff!
In Japanese schools the windows are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a very artistic event for a boy and gives it in hopes of getting to know him better during a vacation.
That's what I read in my Manga-Comics.
I have a lot of curiosity to see if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always answered:
"Well, because I'm fascinated."
Finally, I'd rather read Mangas years ago.
To get a better understanding of comics and culture, one day I began to study some Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I'm going to travel there.
Also because I have a bottle of tradition and customs.
Here they have a great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of latest technologies and trends, on the other, a country of severe, disciplined and traditional.
As everything is well organized, I still haven't felt lost here, though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
The rats also have feelings
It is said that a rat or a cat feels the danger of flying, why is he also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can they be controlled if they behave in a similar way to us, feel the same?
In an Internet magazine called "Edge" for many years the contributions of famous scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I believe that animals have senses and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now, although we can not even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains present the same basic configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about consciousness and generally about consciousness, we enter the unknown area because hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as other animals: death, flight or attack.
People behave in a similar way, as some scientists draw conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to capture our subjective experience with animals.
First, almost always include circuits associated with human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobula of brain cortex (because of their participation in the short memory and in the executive functions leading to conduct).
This wide part is much more developed in the case of people than in other primates and it seems absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Taking into account at least the aspects of our conscience that depend on the prefrontal lobe of brain cortex, including our knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is one reason to assume that even man differs from other primates.
Another particularity is in man's linguistic nature: As most of his experience is combined with language, this often means that consciousness depends on him.
In this case animals may be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the conscience of animals, created anyway, would differ in many cases from most of our states of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to explain how the conscience of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, does not stop measuring because it has special hardware, nor does it stop examining through our experiences, so your research presents us with major problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of consciousness, but at the same time there is another aspect of consciousness that should be easier for scientific research.
Animal consciousness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during short-term primary memory studies, especially in the case of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick the essential is better suited to the neutral correlations of consciousness than the causal mechanisms: Both can be similar or not.
This approach clearly highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobula of brain cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what's the result of that for feelings?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain that is responsible for that is what happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain occupys an area of the defense system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
In view of this point of view, sensations are very fixed by brain cortex which distinguishes primates and, above all, man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature, we continue to classify fine feelings because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar so that we can describe the states of others to each other.
For example, Antonio Damasco, on the other hand, believes that feelings are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the brain cortex responsible for the body's feelings and the trunk of the entrepreneur, as does Jaak Pankseep, but focuses more on the trunk of the entelephone.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can be referred absolutely to different types and their feelings.
For theoretical reasons I can't go against that, but I don't think it's likely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel like fear may also be felt in two cases: But how can you control if rats and men behave similarly?
When the danger comes to a bird bird, why are you afraid?
I am of the opinion that the gender of behaviour still does not prove the gender of experience.
That's true that neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar encephalitis trunks, but otherwise they don't have at least one brain.
Is the boss's throne responsible for feelings?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, too, probably also cocachachas (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to try it.
I would like to investigate the emotional behavior of rats and emotional feelings because their feelings are supposed to be fundamentally different from ours (for human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected as it is measured by rats and men.
As I do not invest in the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
It can be said that I don't see any more than my narcissists, but I prefer to keep working without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
The President of UEFA Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Ivan Wasjunik, the Deputy Prime Minister, said that preparations would soon take place under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as evidence of Ukraine's confidence in its ability to organise Europe's campaign with Poland," said Vasjunik.
"But that is not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and there is much to do in both countries."
The time for the construction and reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in host countries is dead.
Perhaps the number of stations will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to work very fast," said the president of an association of Ukraine Grigory Surkis.
"The UEFA is not going to remove our eyes."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish PZPN association and replaced it by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that PZPN is unable to follow the rules," Drzewicki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA Platini President that preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last period were many clubs of the first division condemned for manipulation at the lower class, and finally the division council had to be postponed.
Enraged Dennis Quaid's contraction
She wanted to promote a new film, she was talking in an interview about private life--and she has problems with her ex-Marid: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designed her ex-Marid as an adult.
It's too much for the counterattack.
The late war of the two roses in the former couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce, the two Hollywood players publicly show a unpleasant war between them.
Last week in an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was very unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She assumes the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for revealing private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of the failure of a marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his appointment as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "unheard of how many times Meg tells the stories of our relationship in another version," said 54-year-old man to "New York Daily News".
Among other things, it's very "laden" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again "will recall pain and changes in public, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is newly married and recently he's a father of bees.
And so he ended with his statements by highlighting: "Whatever my life goes on.
I'm happy because I have a wonderful family that's okay."
Air tickets and hotels are low
In the first half of 2008, plane tickets and overnight nights in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, air tickets in Germany were made cheap even up to 50 percent.
Air tickets and hotel overnight nights were made cheap again - this is the result of a study by the travel service provider and the American Express financial services.
The company has analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and after price increases in the first quarter have resulted in a major change in the second half.
After years of increasing prices in the hotel market, overnight nights in many places were made cheap.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 different cities of Europe increased by an average of 6.9 per cent between January and March.
From April to June prices have already dropped by 3.6 per cent compared with last year.
The trends were more perceptible in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for this was the low-cost dollar course, which was the reason that "the interests of American tourists on their journey have decreased."
The decrease in hotel prices is also noted much more in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than at industrial concentration points such as Hannóver, Colonia or Stavanger.
In the city of Norway hotel prices increased by 26.3 percent and thus cut a record in Europe.
In the first trimester, air ticket prices also showed the high trends:
Due to the increase in the prices of cruisers in the Economy class, the average cost of payments was 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-range flights even made more expensive up to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June the prices of the airline tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell by an average of 12.5 per cent, but the price changes for the Business and Firstclass were small.
In Germany price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices increased to 11.9, and in the second half they fell to 23.6 per cent.
According to one study, prices for national flights in Germany even decreased by half.
The cause of price change is partly the increase in the flow economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the airline travel market, demand is underway.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies Treaty which liberalises the traffic between the United States and Europe.
The sign of the situation is the cancellation of non-profit flights in air companies, as well as a large number of air companies declared in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe were 24 air companies.
HSV won against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia has not yet gone out to make the dimmoty hole.
Christopher Klein well presented the forced landing of the national selection player Marko Martin.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed making a hole.
All I wanted to say was that by reacting precisely to what happened, I could clearly read it from his lips.
I just knew I was right.
"We need a second gol," said Hermann Rieger at the entrance of the stadium in Hamburg.
There was nothing special about the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of those present were back in their places.
Rieger was almost three decades of HSV physiotherapy, enjoying a great reputation as one of those who were part of the group.
That is why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach sat with his head and raised his fingers in a seating sign.
Cornelius is a brother of Martin Jol, the main coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Go, the second gol!
But that wasn't done.
"Today it wasn't all nice to see," added then Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard had also wanted to have him "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Ms. Petric (11) for its headache; and also for the situation that Gladbach's very weak team could not show all its strength to Hamburg's weak team.
"That was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol in summary.
This month the Hamburg SV will meet its 121 years.
The Saturday will be the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of the table on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We can interpret it," said Marcell Jansen.
It is expected that the partial qualification of the table corresponds to the speed of the link rather than to the rule of its HSV.
The quipo with its due players later such as the brazilians Neves and Silva, the seeker Petric and Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to join, but still the quipo cannot shine with their success.
"We need more of feeling and dribbling," Jol asks.
After the vote was taken
The Wall Street spreads fear.
The first news on the failure of the bank rescue package left Down Jones at 700 points for a certain period.
That was the loss of the biggest points for one day in his history.
After the Dow Jones recovered a little.
Over 20:30 one of the world's most important pocket barometers contributed a deficit of 5 per cent to 10,579 units.
Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained at 1548 points.
At this time the biggest loss in the Dow Jones was the American Express that lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of nearly 12 percent.
No title could be won.
The goldmann Sachs bank's shares were almost 10 percent lost.
Just a few days ago a large investor Warren Buffet had been involved financially in the company.
The rescue plan provides for resources to buy so-called “podium” mortgage actions.
But the sum will be paid by strike but step by step.
As a result, the State has to receive the option of action for financial associations that may be taken during the course to reduce the financial burden of the state's box.
Action courses in Europe and in the United States continue to decline
Billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not calm investors.
The course of the actions of the German big bank Hypo Real Estate is low and has a negative influence on the Dax.
Despite the saving of the financial market planned by the state, the U.S. Dow Jones index is still falling.
The losses of the speculative actions of the Real State Hypo and the Commercialbank caused the fall of the German Index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the rescue actions of the federal government and private banks, Munich's real estate fund has lost two thirds of its value for a period of time, the Merczbank has lost more than 20 per cent.
The Dax clearly fell below the psychological limit of 6,000 points and contributed a 3.7 per cent deficit to 5.839 units.
Financial markets all over the world suffered a fall.
The opening of Wall Street's day in New York began with significant losses.
Investors fear that the savings package of US$700 billion will not be sufficient to push financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to stay at 10.809.25 points.
The House of Representatives of the United States wanted to vote on the draft rescue, which could be the first of October.
The other European balls also knew only one trend: the FTSE index in London was 3.2 per cent lost, the CAC 40 in Paris was 2.9 per cent lost.
In Asia, the main Japanese index Nikkei after benefits fell to 1.26 per cent in 11.743,61 units.
In Hong Kong the Hang-Seng index was 2.1 per cent to stay at 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main index of Sensex lost 506,43 points or 3.9 per cent and remained in 12,595.75 units.
After an announcement of capital expansion, Arkandor's actions were lost in the MDax.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim signed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourist consortium announced that the participations in Thoms Cook would not be sold.
Dark matter affects the trajectory of space probes
For many years a mystery phenomenon has led to misconscientious researchers: the Oscura Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the manoeuvre.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Relativity Theory cannot be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" took nearly 18 years flying in the universe.
'Cause the fuel tubes are now on their knees threatening a death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational assistance to manoeuvre, has caused confusion among researchers.
The gravitational assistance is a manoeuvre of the trajectory of space probes while they get acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example Earth.
This allows space probes to store fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as well as the Sun Ulysses probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missions do not behave 100 percent as expected under the gravitational law.
More frequent speed irregularities.
The probes are improvised at higher or lower speed.
The physicists couldn't explain this effect until now.
It was called anomaly during gravitational assistance to the work.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of Albert Einstein's Relativity that describes the force of attraction of the material by the curvature of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the physical American Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton believes solemnly now as before Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Oscura Matteria, where astronomers remained in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly can be the Dark Matter which can also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Researchers in the universe know the existence of the Dark Matter for only ten years.
It is supposed to have the attraction force and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Matter, on the other hand, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists, the Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed, after ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of ransoms.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the liberation.
Five Germans are kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom have already begun.
The Germans always fall back at the point of attention of the kidnappers.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper tells about the most important cases.
In view of the fact that European tourists kidnapped in Sahara are free.
The same information is available on State Egypt television, Al-Arabija Arab television station and Italian media.
After news of the release at the Italian station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, Italian Foreign Minister, confirmed the release: "Our concierges and other queens are released.
"Now we control your health," said Frattini.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian followers are all right and are in security, informing state Egyptian television.
The 19 participants of the expedition in the desert are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the Egyptian security guard's descriptions, the kidnappers were ready to finish the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the ransom," said the guard.
It was just "get the reins" when suddenly this surprise came.
On Sunday, the Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and two of them were detained in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers had demanded the ransom in Germany of EUR 6 million; the money had to deliver to the German wife of one of the queens.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of its security.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release women's reindeer after receiving the ransom.
The men had to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe way to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take the position on this report.
Father's abuse "has led to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by his father led to a woman killing herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indeterminate assault.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an indigatory study, knew that he had regularly arrested his daughter, Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession paper: "I feel responsible for your death."
The court knew that Ms. Randle had committed suicide in her home of Mutley in Plymouth on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
At the time the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to catch her and sell her eyes before carrying out her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter was transferred to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Ms. Randle, who had spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was troubled by the abuse she had suffered twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court as some of Mrs. Rande's friends had said of her, who, after being a big surfist and cyclist, now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "refused to life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terraza Randle, met the woman who died in his apartment in Plymouth.
Ms. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by submerged through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's father, who wrote a confession letter concluding: "I used to arrest her and tear her eyes.
It's never been a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for your death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetist, and for his victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when I was only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim leaving his own life.
Even more obvious is that if she hadn't done it, the question probably wouldn't have ended in the courts."
And he added: "I noticed the effect that Stephanie's father and mother had on their daughter over the years, according to the description.
Obviously she could have had a future promising, successful and happy."
An official loaded for data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who had forgotten some secret documents on the train in June would be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on his way to work by the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
It is certainly less serious under the law and does not provide any indication of the intention to commit a crime.
The BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner recalled that the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the protection of information.
The Real Legal Service noted that the staff member should be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive entity of its work in the Committee on Secret Services.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about Al-Qaeda and the capacity of security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision by Monday morning and then transferred from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Great Britain, construction companies could face a price of over 80,000 pounds after the rescue/saving of Bradford and Bingley bank.
In fact, the Government provided 14 billion excl. pounds to protect the deposits of 2.6 million bank restorers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies using savings money, including 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Construction Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers that companies and their members must pay
If so, the loan of 14 billion should be reimbursed after Bradford and Bingley's mortgages have been recovered.
However, interest on the whole is expected to be charged annually to 700 financial companies holding deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is embarrassing that the institutions that acted with caution ... are called to pay today the price of institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is said that each company had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and that mediation companies had to pay about 18 per cent of the cost.
The treasure estimates that the interest on the loan will rise to $450,000 in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover 81 thousand pounds of excl. to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Trade Association of Construction Companies, told the BBC that this situation was unfair.
"It is humiliating that institutions which acted with caution in the growth of the real estate market are called upon to pay the price produced by those who were far less prudent."
According to BSA, there are no data indicating the failure of some company since 1945.
"We will need to consider all aspects of this issue in the coming weeks to find out what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what might be a relevant price," Mr. Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of demanding interest, which can be almost twice as many.
As mutual organizations and without shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest rates in their savings.
The price of milk up to five pounds per litre
The inhabitants of the Jersey street will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the highest price of dairy products will increase by an extra five thinks the litre since next month.
It is the second increase in the price of this year, after an increase of two thought in February and following the investigations carried out by a consulting company.
Traders can decide for themselves if they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had increased before February was in 2002.
Negade freedom under finance to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladesh tribunal has rejected the application for freedom under finance for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the sense that she can be brought back to prison when she comes back to her country.
His defenders said that the court did not grant him freedom under finance by accusing him of expulsion of 50 million taka ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various allegations of corruption in its charge.
His long-term political rival, Khaleda Zia, was set free at the beginning of this month.
The return of Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the next few weeks, but its party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's government, supported by military support, grant it its first full freedom.
The correspondents say that while you are given the conditional freedom to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is now unclear what the terms of your release are or if you will be able to stay free when you return to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request for freedom under finance for Sheikh Hasina, arguing that she could not obtain freedom under finance because she was already being treated abroad under conditional freedom," his lawyer Rafique-ul Huk said.
"We are going to introduce an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
Its defenders argued that she needed freedom under finance to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after 17 October, according to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the interim government, supported by the army, assumed power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all the charges they are charged with.
Fears for the campaign against polymyelitis in Afghanistan
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan - says the United Nations - have not been able to benefit from a recent anti-poliomyelitis vaccination campaign due to Taliban violence.
Last week the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that children could not be reached in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said that despite the promises made by the Taliban that would not have been attacked or prevented by thousands of staff while the vaccinations were being carried out.
BSkyB lost legal challenge in ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission after the decision to force the company to reduce its participation in the broadcasting network.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Tribunal that it will have to reduce its participation in ITV by 17.9 per cent below 7.5 per cent.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB's interests hampered competition and allowed its influence in ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, by buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti Monopolio Office reported that the acquisition of ITV participation by BSkyB had raised doubts about the independence of ITV, and moved the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including the chief of Virginia, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Offcom regulator, were opposed to the purchase.
BSkyB, he commented that the obligation to reduce its ITV package was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because BSkyB said it would have delivered its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of U.S. lawyers
The Attorney-General of the United States has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice critical of the implementation of administrative staff.
The report criticised the staff of the White House, the legislators and former Produtor General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation have lied to researchers in an attempt to impede justice.
"Special complaints of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," said Prosecutor General Glenn Bellas in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from their duties by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the Department had motivated the decision by suggesting that lawyers had been dismissed by low income.
But later it was assumed that lawyers had not been evaluated more than other colleagues, and many observers concluded that divorces would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers concerned had worked in the persecution of some Republicans, members of the High Profile of the Congress, while others had refused to investigate electoral fraud charges against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and judge cases for the Government
and may be dismissed at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next Chief of the Department of Justice, Prosecutor General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure by the dissidents, gave up his position.
A certain number of other officials of the Department of Justice did the same.
The report of the Prosecutor-General is very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in the matter, stressing how he had a "primary responsibility" for the questionnaires, who "addicted" his leadership position and was "notably uncooperative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, former Bush co-worker, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Epica de Meat Loaf is very honored
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for its epic charm Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect the special prize next week at the ceremony that will take place in London, said that gaining this recognition would be "an honor".
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf graduated in 1977.
The Coldplay group is carrying out applications for this year's prizes and making the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-general of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that spend time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal capacity as used by Meat Loaf.
An instrument section of almost two minutes opens the hymn.
The song was first known as a single in the United Kingdom in 1979 and became number 15 in the classification.
However, Bat Out Of Hell of Meat Loaf remained for some nine years in the classifications and came to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for his cardiac arrhythmia in 2003, after a stroke during a concert.
In 2007, an acute larynx forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later he emerged that he had a chest in his vocal cords.
Dark city street, often forgotten and maybe ready for sale
New York City has thousands of apartments, blubbers, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply service.
However, for many people, including veteran taxiists and local residents, it is difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of the First Calle – before I found the Second Calle – between the Bowery and the Second Avenue.
This slope, more than 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, is similar to a pulverizing slope more than an active path.
There are no signs.
It's practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that recently built luxury buildings in the First Calle
who wants to renovate Extra Place and create a clean patio to shops and shops that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the old-date neighbors who commented on being liked by the truck simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block's past before the buildings are adapted.
However, the Department of Housing, Conservation and Development of the City, which has control of the road, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Committee on the Environment for the use of land held this month, representatives of the Avalon Agency outlined a proposal to buy the road.
However, the Committee, wishing the road would remain in the city, asked for a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the Community, said.
"The city is owned today by very few spaces and we would like to continue to own Extra Place," said Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install seats, including some to be used as coffee, in the hope of renting spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street came up for the first time during the meeting this month
But Michele of Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, he didn't necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renewal of this abandoned street and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal was coming from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was a city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission was the development of property rather than its management.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, the Bowery, Extra Place, has left a hole in history.
Some believe that he got his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large property firm was divided between his children and this narrow landline was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that was closed in 2006, was opened in Extra Place, but the street may be better known for the photograph of the establishment going out on the cover of Ramones 'Rocket in Russia' album.
"The environment was magnificent," commented Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, cartons, sheets, strings."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about East Village's abbreviation, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, however modest, should continue to be public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, practically unchanged, a king of the city that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiahh's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A Bittly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a narrative of the city's history on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a little narrow and uneven street street, I also dark for the day and marked by oxidated iron storage doors and anti-windows, with old weekly newspapers covered along the canals."
With few exceptions, the street seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured through the back of the street and stood near the door used to get into the CBGB and now a luxury dress shop.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-oz beer bottle were close to a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some passengers said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but they suggested that a cleaning might be given to him.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimated the attractive power of the street in their current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet and dry places."
The debate on bilingualism: membership in English
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in studies on California and director of studies of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling Spanish voters effectively is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "the Africans and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than the white students," and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for students-English.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment to bilingual education, which prefers instruction in different languages of English at school, is effective in canceling the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a primary school officially recognized in the eastern region of the Los Angeles county.
In this school the vast majority of students are Spanish and family with low income:
more than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are learning English.
However, an amazing 100 per cent of students in the fourth year have been evaluated positively in the 2008 math review.
and almost 93 per cent have dominated the English language and art test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient that Mr. Obama has favored.
The Sixth Street school emphasizes the revision and practice, the constant assessment of competencies and does not tolerate any attitude of apology.
Furthermore, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the head of the Sixth Calle, of the school for English instruction to students is in "total immersion".
Emerging in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the content of the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said to me, "We have had extraordinary success with students as this last student who has come from Mexico and that if you went to school 12 months later, you wouldn't be able to pick up what was going on."
"It works," he said, "we believe it works."
Will Mr Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for replication by other schools with large populations of Spanish-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of the politicians of their party on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have been advocates of bilingual education for a long time) and their constant support for bilingual education obscures Mr. Obama's reply.
Although immigrants should learn English, Mr Obama has recently raised the issue by allowing people to stop worrying about the legislation that is written only in English.
and instead, he said, "You should make sure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close the gaps, he should consider carefully the models of education that work well, rather than ignore or trivialize them.
The price of oil falls sharply after the renewed economic fears
The oil price is drastically reduced this month due to the concern that the US redemption plan for financial markets may not be able to re-establish the economy.
Gross oil operations decreased from 7 per cent to $99.80 in the morning negotiations in New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has fallen from more than $20 per barrel since last month.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been damaged by the financial crisis in Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before returning, once again due to serious uncertainty in the financial markets.
The concern was expressed by investors, once again, on Monday, despite the leaders of the Congress that said they had reached an agreement at the end of the week on the ransom plan, the biggest in history.
The news was overwhelmed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that took place during the last phase of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will purchase the bank operations of the Wachovia Corporation, as the government said this month.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts in Barclays Capital said that, at the end of the week, the negotiations leading to the ransom agreement "it seemed impossible to react to the market's sense."
As the economic situation deteriorates, the demand for basic products, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rate and change will become increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that basic products cannot escape this infection.
From the product perspective, our most urgent concern is whether the American virus will spread worldwide and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, such as low oil consumption due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast reduction in oil and gas prices is 20 per cent for 2009.
Second living room: team sets record
After it happened, during the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in Jets' uniform, playing defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw how things developed in the second room this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a game without annotation into a game of disinflation.
"I've never seen anything like that," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Cardinal Arizona had played with a wall under the shadow of the clouds.
At this point, the quarterback Brett Fabre met Laveranues Coles with a 12-yard goal and suggested the perfect price for one afternoon, in which the development of relationship between players had a great jump forward.
Favre met Cole for two more targets in the room, one of these when a cornerback fell and the other came 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," said Fabre of all the steps to Cole.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think."
While Favre and Coles were executed in the arrest, Cardinals' defence abused Kurt Warner's quarterback.
The Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a going shot and turned it back 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed out another passage and interrupted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was obliged to lose Warner.
In the last round, the shortcomings required by Bowens could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken the possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the balloon, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard patio to win a final 34-0.
These are the biggest points the Jets ever did in a room.
To the team coach, Eric Mangini, ask him to describe the conversation right now, he said, "The second room or the third room?"
When he answered both of them - the Jets allowed 21 points without answer in the third room - Mangini said: "I can say I liked the second room much more than the ground.
They have won a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Gebrselasia relaxes its global record
Once again, Haile Gebrselasie of Ethiopia has demonstrated that many consider him the greatest story runner, overcoming his own global record on the Berlin marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person able to run the 26.2 miles race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the full-time career at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has destroyed for 27 seconds its previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselasie has established the world record number 26 in a career of an impressive length so that he has set up a global championship or a world record for any distance from the race opposite to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselasie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, retrospectively - that air pollution will aggravate its problems with asthma.
On the contrary, he was about to run to Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - lonely and with 48 degrees when starting the race, 55 degrees to the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using in medium term a 4 minutes short 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Targat from Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the victory last Sunday, Gebrselasie told reporters that he had suffered camels in the pantorail two weeks ago and that he had lost a week of training.
It's obvious that the suspension left him fresh, not oxidated.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselasie said to the journalists.
"It was all perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but it was all right."
The athlete has been the subject of some criticisms - especially in Kenya, the Afro-Oriental rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating too much of its careers, generally avoiding meeting with many stars of the world marathon, based on the brands as if it were a career track, and putting them in front of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not reduce the size of Gibraltar's skills as a driver.
This Sunday, at the turn of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached the middle of the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners James Kambai and Charles Kamathi began challenging Gebrsselassie after their brands decreased.
But shortly before three miles of the target, Gebrselassie took a last push to separate from Kambai, who ended up at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's career, Irina Mikitenko, native to Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain has the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also did not participate in the Beijing Games because it was described as a back injury, but she recovered to win Berlin and set up her best personal record in almost five minutes on the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculation career, leaving a room of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to make heads and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second place at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and trials of colour life
Hidden by the expansion of the park on the theme of the Great Orlando, just a few kilometres from the bright, rustic and cholera city, there is a quiet people, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks incorporated in the country and place of Zora Neale Hurston's childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "The city of five lakes, three fields of croquet, 300 men of color, 300 good navigators, many guayabas, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to Zora's annual fair in Eatonville to punish Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Rebirth.
And, however, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a tourist stage by including it in Florida's travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the period of depression – remains a separate place.
The city is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the '30s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and doesn't know what's going on."
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called for attention to start a dialogue on the subject of race, many remain cautious in front of the outside.
"We are very careful about how our history is counted," said Jones Hortense, 59 years old, a resident of the city's oldest church.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a triumphal parade and struggle.
At the same time it is a historical model of the statement of black people and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a double level of poverty in the national media.
It is a literary center, but it is also an example of the rural culture of the South - sometimes dehydrated, other praised - which was born of slavery in America.
It's not strange if those who live here are still proud and reserved.
And the concern about Eatonville's image really started by Zora, as no one here calls you Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her native city to the world through her deep textbooks in dialect such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in Florida's guide turned the city, just outside Route 17, into a road that runs through the center of Florida often forgotten into the history of the blacks and the human drama.
With a cement face both in life and in literature, Mrs. Hurston led her readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the road to the left," he wrote, "there's the modern public school sailon with its white ends, its well-contained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can only read and write."
She also mentions the new husband of the Dash's wife and writes that Glenn Lee "sales drinks of all kinds and everything goes with transitional rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston is dealing with Eatonville with the autonomous government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Now she described it as it was," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who Mrs. Hurston immortalized by citing men who were singing colorless songs about their beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as an excentration of life which returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, recalls that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without warning in a big Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud to wear with dignity.
Most of the residents were fascinated, said Mr. Franklin, while many were sarcastious.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But he adds, balancing himself in his chair in a backyard overlooking the Sabelia Lake, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer printed.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about it.
Although it was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman in the Barnard College in the 20s, it was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no large Memorial ceremonies or large public readings.
"I don't think their contribution to the world or their heritage was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-way road through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two main road of the working community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of his history.
Enforced integration, among other things, had put him in relatively identical isolation of the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mix brought hatred to the community.
"During that period, a group of white boys went through the city shooting oranges and everything against the people who were sitting next," said Mr. Franklin.
"They also killed a girl once.
They fired him against a car sandwich."
In a letter from 1955 to Mrs. Hurston wrote to The Orlando Sentinel newspaper, critical of the strong integration of the Supreme Court which, in Brown v. Board of Education, "indicted rather than honor my race."
R Residents today say that the disintegration of schools, positive in some respects, has weakened Eatonville's cohesion and undermines the confidence of its young people.
"The black children were used to being robbed - I agree with this - they used to greet the teacher in the morning and at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, an organization without profit.
This lasted until teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wasn't talking to your teacher because she was white--there's a cultural break there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, have helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the prejudices, just as she did, with great confidence and lines like: "How can something deny itself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous tomb and began fighting to bring her back to life.
Five years later, a woman named Hurston's biography by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the libraries, re-introducing it into the American canons.
The road project came just when Eatonville's most famous daughter was again under the reflections.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what could be destroyed by this road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January many returned to the event.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The resurrected idea of the road five ways would have been to put into what you would call curvature speed, a real civil pride," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd simply said, "Now you saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped change the image of the same city.
People out of town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to the church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (with the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a renovated and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville continues to be anomaly in Florida: at only six miles from the center of Orlando, you may sometimes feel like in a street of the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
The deserters who come looking for the history of Eatonville, of its meaning, are often treated with caution.
An early permission is needed to do most of the interviews, and some things - such as the walls in Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has a weakness by bright red, still fear that her island community may be misunderstood.
And, however, as the Hurston festival has expanded, there has also emerged a higher level of natal pride.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw all her race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also to other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, working, round and mixed.
It is a sincere civil sense that can be heard in the voice of the 18-year-old nephew of Mr. Franklin, Edwin Harvey, who was planning to return to Eatonville after the university to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old Winter Park gemes, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, if they dare to go to here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to anyone else'," says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at your history, it's a very pleasant city."
For here, in New York, everyone is talking about finances
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from the whiskeys and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't be expected to be in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass façade of the office-to-be-be-be-be-be-beiges which are on top of their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers who are monopolizing New York are facing daily with the worst "day of the office" since the fall of 1929.
Chicos for home delivery continue to resonate their metal carts for tea through steels and carry muffin bands for breakfast meetings.
Latin men continue to drag between built-in apartments, like human furniture, with 50 eccentric printing shirts glued to a yoke through their shoulders. The office workers are still waiting in the corner for their food to take from the morning, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between the 4th and 7th in the afternoon on working days.
The employees are still waiting to take their luggage to the carts of the sellers, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on the days of the week.
I felt like there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimist predictions there, I decided to open a new account of savings.
Although I had calculated the time necessary for the operation to coincide with the calm of the end of the afternoon at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, a hill of more than 20 people were already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw your effectiveness or make a deposit, but in front of the customer's service bank, where clients throughout life order their checkouts, tourists are looking for instructions to go to Macy's big stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people were ahead of me, I was informed later by Starr, my personal trust banker, and they were in college for the same reason I was.
Unlike me, they had already removed their savings from the smaller banks in places where they had exchanged them, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from so-called savings associations (a little like a construction company), credit unions and savings boxes in their home city whose branches only work within the state of ownership, and who say they treat customers as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have failed quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion assets, entered into a bank, and as the neo-Yorquins headed to their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with some savings deposits of $440 billion, he was looking for a rescue buyer.
The workers at the offices and shops who were standing before me, fearing another blow, were moving their money to a bank which is considered a safe refuge, which is doing most of the rescues in Wall Street.
Normal people in New York have become financial experts in the last few weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her injured executive director, Dick Full, commented on the matter with familiarity as if they were missing from a colleague's activity.
And Lynn, fifty and something in the form of my apartment block, has changed the normal route of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shopping in the tent.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "Now I have all my savings in the cash market.
The move is done, I'm not taking any risks."
Muslim drums buried at the time Austria approached the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left hand side of the extreme right-wing party for the freedom of Austria and Philip Dewinter Belgium, affiliated to the right-hand party Vlaams Belang, participate in a demonstration to present to the organization "Citys Against Islam" in Ammeras on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They take traffic signals that represent the mixes with a red line that passes through.
The police are blaming extreme right extremists for profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that political parties on the right made huge gains in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in Traun's cemetery, near Linz, at some time between Friday night and this morning, where the police thought it was an organized action.
The criminals had broken Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David on some of the graves, but researchers think this could have happened by attempting to hide the real motives of extremists motivated by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in some way related to the elections.
A spokesman from the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the profanation, which came to Muslims when the month of Ramadan was ending.
In the meantime, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the turn to the right in the parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two extreme-right parties, which were almost 30 per cent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had conducted a campaign focused on anti-immigrants and some of their slogans were considered xenophobous by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 per cent of the vote, gave his campaign against headaches and Burkas, and also expressed opposition to the food considered related to Islam.
In his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European host" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties tried to ban the construction of mixtures and minerals, arguing that they were symbols of the current Islamic policy in Austria and Europe.
Investigations and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the country's strongest political blockade, indicate that the change is mainly caused by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating child sex abuse rock star, from traveling to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the supervisory authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent's police issued a ban on travelling abroad last Thursday after the judges had produced evidence of Glitter's previous sentences for sexual abuse of children.
Glitzer, a real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Judges' Court in Kent, but I was represented by the attorney Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Justice Service said: "On Thursday, 25 September at the Justice of Ashford's Judges in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's foreign journeys such as to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, since he was under the register of sexual offenders.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
and it is also necessary to communicate to the police the scheduled date with seven days before their departure.
Kent's police said he wouldn't discuss the individual case or possible Glitter's standoff in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "The Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "The Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to watch someone who stays in the United Kingdom because here we have systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protecting Kent's residents is the main concern of Kent's police and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of sexual offenders registered in the county and to minimize any risk to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused his entry and he wanted to return to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker was at the Uxbridge Court of Judges in western London after Scotland Yard successfully applied the order to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of Interior, calmed down and rejoiced to know that Glitter had been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
"Appointed to the teacher out of stage to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photoographer
No tacones, no flying or wearing outer garments.
The essence of the great teachers of the flamenco, who are distracted from concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in the privacy, in those moments old to the public, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expression of some hands, disappointed because they are not going out to the scene.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatre of some scenes with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less-known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of the flamenco from different areas.
Included in the programming of the Moon of Flamenca Photography, the exhibition "reviews the international importance of flamenco, most of every day", explains the creator, who explains that "Flamenco-people" "can be people of any kind but, when you see the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "in the street" are artists capable of conveying in a scene of passion, sadness, joy... protecting the public.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos from the stage.
Take your personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to grasp with the camera the personality of the great flamenco."
With the taste of the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began a long trip in 1,997 to portrait the singers, guitarists or dancers with a silver camera.
These are pictures that, due to the selection of camera and material, remember classical photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classic base of the image, entrusting modernity to it, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands the flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day."
It is not the act of the dance, song or touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which protects with his art to the public.
The search for a meeting with the essential, with the doubt that is made visible in a way of feeling, being and being sound and having been the constant of this work presented in the gallery El Fotomata these days.
Famenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, set this selection of almost seventy photographers.
The project has become an anthology of the flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the photographs presented in the sample.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "SportARTProject".
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I like to draw people, to know them and be able to enter a moment in his life, whether it is a long or short moment.
I think within photography the picture is the most difficult gender.
You meet or face people, characters, sometimes you don't know, or they just leave you a few minutes to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of photographs of the current flamenco, which is entitled "Flamenco-people" is shown in the Gallery El Fotomata, located in number 20 of the street of the Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where it can be visited until the next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa believes that the novel he writes is "a fear"
It is environment in places that still do not know and read about unknown matters, but yet, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to moving forward to the new project in which he works, a novel that has been a protagonist to Roger Casamant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite of the Nobel Prize in Literature acknowledged yesterday in his step by Hay Festival Segovia that the project that he is occupied today "is a fear" and that "all indicates that he shouldn't write" the novel.
"If it was sensitive, I wouldn't do it, but I'll do it and I hope to finish it sometimes," he concluded in his intervention at the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that have been seen through the city of Aceuduct for four days to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the outstanding figures of the third edition of the festival of the word and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the award There Festival because he was the most voted writer - an ancient edition of "Our mutual friend" by Dickens-, filled with the horror of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him a public delivered to whom he was very short in time when the Peruvian, with a progressive memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how he was born in him his literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of "reading pleasure" and "living more than what he had lived"; how he writes of "disciplined way" to supplement his "inspiration lack" with an intense work of documentation, correcting and repairing much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which their stories are supported.
The Spanish novelist recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an efimeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "make people more incorrigible", so he asked the writers "don't give up" and "take responsibility" their vocation.
Climateology cements the Pozoblanco fair that also remains unresolute
The region festival that closed the subscription of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended in the morning after checking the announced areaers that the square floor was not in the best conditions.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohörquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the event.
Meterologic supplements have been launched with this holiday, since at least two of its three festivals have not been able to celebrate.
The Sabbath was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second scheduled bull race.
The cartel consists of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Baptista, who were going to face a funeral of Castilblanco.
So, it was only Friday.
In it, the triunfador was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went out to hombres, after leaving a pleasant and aesthetic passages.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavanante saved his two gifts with greetings and an ear, which gave the tendons more than his tour.
That's right, worse still was El Juli, who went through the body of Los Llanos without any punishment or glory.
In his second tower, after a relief event, he won the bronch of a large part of the public.

Traffic control of Ertzaintza in the municipal term of Arminion (Alava).
The agents give up on the two employees of a train and they take the flight.
His load, more than two tons of iron, wasn't like stopping.
The agents persecuted and detained one of the two employees, a 28-year-old Varon identified as A. A. J., as reported in a communication by the Department of Internal Affairs of the Vascow Government.
The arrested individual has been accused of drug trafficking and falsification of a public document.
The incident was recorded when several officers of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out transport control at N-1, their way through the municipal term of Arminion.
They were ready to stop a van for their inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, hurriedly and jumped.
The agents began their persecution until the vehicle was stopped a few miles later in the arc, when its two crewmen appeared to flee to the street for a forest area.
The Ertzinas finally reached one of them and landed at the 2,178 kilograms of hachis they transported and found after inspecting the train, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with taxi loads, so it was transferred to police units for extensive and heavy drug inspection.
In addition, officials checked that the material had been "doubled" since it did not match the collection in the van documentation, so an offence of falsification of a public document has also been imposed on the arrested.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation into the detention of the other suspect, who managed to escape the road as said, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old prisoner A. A. J. was transferred to police units to carry out the relevant duties and will be brought before the court in the next hours.
Hold the Heather Locklear actress for driving under the effects of any medicine
The actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of any medicine.
A witness saw her perform foreign maneuvers when she tried to get out of her parking in Montecito, according to the People magazine, she revealed a voice from the California road patrol.
The witness has explained that at 16.30 o'clock, Locklear "was putting the accelerator in the background, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot forward and back, and on going back he passed several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly afterward, the witness, who seemed to have not recognized the actress at first, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned the emergency services because "he was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"It seemed disoriented," so the agents took it to the specialized drug and alcohol center to carry out a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse has been eliminated since the first time, although "as the officers observed at first, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medicine".
Locklear was arrested as suspected of driving under the effects of any substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison at 19:00, although he was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear went out of a Arizona treatment clinic where he recovered from an anxiety episode and depression.
You call the U.S. Andalusian Federation to assume its powers in the case of Silva
The IU co-ordinator-in-Office of the United Nations, Gaspar Llamazares, assured today that it will be the regional federation of training which will have to take a decision on the case of the former Conceal of Youth and Sports of the Seville Association, Francisco Manuel Silva, which allowed last week after it was accused of bringing about family-friendly treaties.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its powers," Llamazares said on the action the party should adopt with which the party has so far been conceiling in the siege.
However, the IU leader argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "IU has always defended that this type of matter has the highest degree of transparency".
In the same line he stressed that training has "strengthened ethical codes for all public tasks".
'Mayo Sangre', Garci's Epica Appellate
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós National Episodes, José Luis Garci celebrates the celebrated rise of the Spanish against the French in Sangre in May, which is the most ambitious film in his film with about 15 million euros in budget.
In this way, the film has tried "to illustrate the stream of characters and social analysis" which has always been admired in the work of the well-known novelist, has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Kim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría in front of a wide list of interpreters.
Blood from May, with a meter of more than two and a half hours, is spent this Friday in the cinemas, to become a future minister for Telemedrid for more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci ensures that he has fulfilled this cycle with "a dream of childhood", which he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who since the Madrid Community commissioned him three years ago to roll a memorial tape for the second century of May 2, which he always accepted and when the report was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budgets which the Madrid Community has contributed in its entirety constitute an "one chance" for Garci to have an appropriate environment with the decorations and clothing of "a naked Spanish who was wrong about fighting, since the struggle for independence led the people to a massive delay with the kingdom of Fernando VII," he noted.
But the filmer regrets having had no funding such as the Alatriste or The Goya ghosts - more than the double of the May-May Blood, so he could not turn some plasma scenes into a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost all of his career.
Therefore, the Director of Return to begin has influenced what is his usual form of work, the stage with actors, who often try to start the race and those who don't make casting, because he thinks it's "slow" and consider that "part of the director's office is sitting at the theater and cinema to know what's going on in the industry where he's working".
Many of the interpreters who match in May's blood repeat before their camera, as is the case with Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
A candidate to Oscar on four occasions - one of whom won - Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the very blood of May, seven tables of French billiards and the finally selected, the blind giraffes, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is what you must know," he has assured.
With this movie Garci doesn't expect prizes.
"In the beginning you think you're working for posteriority, then you realize that you're only working for prosperity, and now you agree to make a more film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional trajectory.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the seville dancer Tortola Valencia
A sevilla dancer is going to honor a sevillain as well.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, father of Catalan (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and mother of Andaluza (Georgia Valencia Valencia Valencia), was born in the village of Triana and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
He was a free dance dancer and a specialist in Oriental dances.
I had a loving life, a pioneer of the liberation of women, such as Isodora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and abrogated by the abolition of the course that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe of war, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell your life but to collect your spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested to me the palm of the flamenco.
So "the dance of the maripo" suggested me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" a few tons.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my dance is also within this aesthetic," he says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: the one of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, just as he did at the "Open Door"; and the teacher Matilda Coral, who has exceptionally wanted to collaborate with who was his student.
"Matilde makes Tortola the parent, the character of the adult.
I am happy because I have agreed to act in my work and I feel very honored for it."
The assembly also consists of the musical and guitar composition of Jesús Torres and Pac Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "which makes the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were divine throughout their extension and who are always loved by them".
The work also includes the life of this woman who has developed in such distant places, especially for the time being, such as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to all over Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind you because I think it's from these women who have a huge influence at a certain time and now no one knows and much less value their work," says Bayón.
The show will start today at 20.30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega theater.
The publication of "Diary of a recently married poet" also closes the Trinity
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Renewed poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez contraried marriage with Zenobia in March 1916, is marked within the activities planned by the Council of Culture of the Andalusia Council to celebrate the "Thirio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the Falling of both.
In this way, the "Trenio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to its end with the reorganization of this work, with the International Congress which has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That Chop of Light", which was opened last May and, after traveling through the various Andalusian provinces, will be scheduled to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
The Andalucía Board's Culture Council has also acquired a total of eight copies of the "Day of a Renewed Poet", published by Pedro Taberero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal andalulous poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Aussion of Malicious", and gives the idea of the american filming, and of all America, before the impressive idea that Newman has gone.
Look how much you cost them to give him an Oscar.
And that has been withdrawn since 2007.
And I knew I was very sick.
It's still been a mess for everyone.
"Sometimes what a sitter is beyond all the expression, and I have now lost a big friend," said Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to its existence."
No one was afraid of making the joke or exaggerating.
A father of the film and patriot had died at a particularly dark moment, with fear of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem for land, looking desperately for reasons for dignity.
When it's so hard time and without virtue the men and very few beings who admire you are left, there's no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
I was incarnating for everyone an ideal almost platonic of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and won causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his firstborn son-in-law for overdoses to his family and organic food brand.
A gift to a country that has cost you a lot of money to surrender to a self-sustained food culture.
The vast wave of admiration was called Hollywood without treating nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, Daniel Craig, found that a man didn't die but an age.
Another English, former director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was neither more nor less than the top of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, was attracted to calling Newman his greatest inspiration.
"We have left the list very high for all," observed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tend to try to live as Paul Newman lived: maintaining high the requirement of probation and having a serious and distant private life from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone trying to do it, and Paul Newman is his example.
He got divorced once but then he was married to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful when he certainly missed out on opportunities not to be.
"But why am I going to eat hamburgese out of the house, if I have fetish inside?" he used to smile himself.
In heaven, he sees the pride of his daughters on earth, not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, no one was as proud as the devoted husband, loving father, single grandfather and devoted philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect career of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is to celebrate some Olympics in Madrid and, after the fall of 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's career, I say no!
The perfect career they called her, and I think it was the worst career I've ever had.
A column of disproposals which, if they had taken into account as evaluation and I would have examined it, would be a very clear suspension.
But let's go for parts and from the beginning.
Unintended begin with the collection of the backyard, which makes you have to go ahead.
Which doesn't seem bad to me, but if you're already done doing it all (including the chip to avoid takings on the road).
So don't.
Here you were only allowed to go to collect the dorsal (first unwanted, only for that) and (after the relevant cola), surprise! there was only 'S' cut for the shirt (secondly unwanted, because I need a XL size)
What world do we live in?
Or has the crisis decided to buy only small shirts with less screens and less expensive?
Well, things like these are a little less compared to those of the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very fast to collect the chip, the tail when you arrive is 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the mochila.
More than 35 minutes waited, something incomprehensible for a career where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as I expected, he started the race and we had not yet left the mochila, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain increased the waiting for more than 40 minutes, which was accompanied by contact with popular rebellion and set foot in the castle.
I think some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, they won't even show up with the right time in the classification, because of the chip they told me that, I imagine, I didn't mark my exit correctly.
Since then, if I was asked about the perfect career, this wouldn't come into my mind.
So I think we'll keep dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft Receptionist Search (virtual)
At the conference of MIT Emergency Technologies Microsoft has shown progress in a new system of recognition of human image and interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence without much intelligence but is able to perform some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a launcher to move through the company's field) by listening to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a facial recognition system, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who are – even remember what they are doing – and listen to and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group the present by conversation groups.
In the sample video, the recipient detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
Ask him if he's there to visit someone and tell him he'll be there soon.
It's all blue screen.
That's impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week has been much above a change in Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and it won't have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers came with the most impressive instead of shopping bags, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
All of this is because Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "extras" to Windows.
The road change is appreciated.
Microfoot is right, the operating system is losing its importance, as well as the software.
When Google Chrome came out of the network, I was one of those who came up with the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many have pointed out with certainty that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for hardware and software to be understood.
Complete the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your suggestion.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but we need to think about the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Balmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People always pay less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer only starts to run the Firefox or the Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What do half of the applications that come into the system mean?
It's less.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and ultimately being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I have a small example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of the rest rooms for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
In the refrigeration machine a cartel asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, of course, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather starting in 2010.
In Microsoft they will surely search for the joint launch of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, is going to be billing.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio shined one on Edward Zwick's 'blood Diamond', the same as Al Pakino on 'El Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola and part of the uniform of the gay muscled parish.
And if we get to number star appearances, we can go back to the image of that dot force that raised weights in an ambulance circuit.
In essence, it is not more than the typical male shirt inside in cotton, wheat and no mangoes.
The 'tank', which calls the speaking English, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out over all the others.
First, by his repugnant name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - he has to see with the sport because he gets his name, according to the legend, from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marel' highlights over others by its excellent cotton, by its unisex cut, by its distinctive shade and by the small Belgian flag (recognisable only) that the most emblematic shirt models take as detail in the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian signature is not only focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college suites, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Takes thought for underwear comfort.
Even though it's a shame to leave them as indoors.
They're too cute.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't care"
His enormous appearance with his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is often but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters take their new work seriously in fashion.
For Monica, they're much more than nice and famous girls who give their name.
It has been in Paris in the promotion of Mango’s company in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important prizes so that the Spanish house can sponsor it.
Heat and fear, win in short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I've come to introduce my sister Penelope and I to Mango in this new summer season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the show of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let's go, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
On what basis is your new collection for Mango in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
My sister and I like the 50s and 60s movie, and from there we get a lot of references.
Then, I like to lose myself for a city and watch women dress, how they mix and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Ballina, actress and designer, you're a very polyphaecetic woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, it's all united and they've got a lot of ties in common.
From childhood I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to sneak into my aunt's arms and see her dress.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the attraction park.
Then, of course, I always tried to look after my clothes.
Now you know that the dancers like us very much to make us our styles for the classes and trials, to look at the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when they give you the dress is when you really find the character.
Then everything will be united, yes, with great respect to designers and professionals.
You've done not much since 30 years ago, have you been in a crisis?
What's going on?
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
To me, the biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since childhood and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think you're a mother or not?
Since then, I know I'm going to be a mother because I'm asked by the body and I want to be a young mother; I don't want to lose it.
As for the candidate, I don't care.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with love.
As far as the film is concerned, you're facing a number of stars you've been around last year.
That's right, and I'd like you to see the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, I'm very patient and worried, everything I want for now and of course, can't be.
I want 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of Christ''.
When they look like...
A few days ago you started on a ride with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not that I'm going up to a walker to make a model.
Just, she called me Naomi Campbell, whom I've known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a positive event for her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the dress we showed - I took two pieces of our collection for Mango - was willing to raise money for this Naomi's NGO.
People don't know this earthly heart of Naomi.
They say so many things about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not sure.
In addition, I'm staying with that part so good that she's involved.
He asked me to resign for such a noble cause, but if he comes to ask me to do the pen, I'll do it too.
To benefit women in the third world, what is needed.
Alcohol-reducing drivers must install 'alcolock'
Internally wants the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcohol, he must install in his vehicle a system that prevents the start of the Hebrew vehicle, or if he does not sleep.
The initiative was already announced last June and now appears in the annual memory of the General Public Prosecutor General of the State, which is a pilot project that will last for a year.
Its purpose is to re-introducing the driver, so this will also receive a violent re-education course.
The experience will also include the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for driving Hebrews back to the car.
The alcohol would avoid it because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the air and prevents the car from running if the driver does not sleep; or when an alcohol concentration is detected is higher than allowed.
It costs more than EUR 1,000 and would run for the penalty.
In this regard, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices were reduced to 65 per cent during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save 115 people every year.
The measure is subject to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address these behaviours before they fall into criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, as legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and yet the necessary reform by criminal means requires reform in an organic law.
The device is still not available on the Spanish market in no commercial mode, although it has already been experimentally implemented in some industrial and public vehicles.
In the morning, the Congress of MPs will vote tomorrow for an initiative of the PSOE in which this system is proposed to be installed on school buses, as has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
By British point, at 17.40, the time scheduled for the programme had landed in the presidential Hungarian airport Benito Juárez de Mexico DF the plane of the Spanish Air Force on which the Asturias Principles were travelling.
The sun was retreating, but its rays were still forced to use their hands in a direction to see the real couple coming down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver if I knew that the Spanish Principes had visited the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very good, then you can't go to the airport to load that time... she's from here or...
No, no, sir, she's Spanish but she's lived here for a few years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who are the Principles of Asturias and the importance of travel.
Many are waiting at the airport hangar attached to the red carpet and to a military valley formed by 27 marine soldiers who interpret the salvation of honour.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the Princess, melena to the wind, very sad, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps they had told her that in the DF she threatened the storm.
They give a smile and listen to the photographers before going to the room where the official committee is waiting.
At the hotel's door where they are staying, one of the four great cities of the city, awaits them with a news item on Mexican television.
The best available mode
There is probably no place in the world most suitable for presenting a fashion prize, which Paris and possibly no more exclusive and well-lived live designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards to strengthen the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is available with a EUR 300,000 award.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in Mango escape at number 54 of the Paris Haussmann Boulevard and almost laughed at the emotion.
Of course, this is the second largest store in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, coupled with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who would preside over the jury of the ceremony, made us finish in a lullo scene at the opera Garnier de Paris.
With the closer of the more exclusive Chagals, the presidential table prepared by Mango was more spectacular.
Nati, with the heart torn from pain and making his heart three times, because of his brother's recent falsification, was wearing a dress from the House and some ELAH addresses, which cut the breath, and the arm of his son Luis - a chain of almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the chair of his homecoming dinner.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, did the honours and he's so horsey that he ended up with Rotchil's baron, without jackets, because they both had been served to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who attended the store with pants and shirts - of her own design - and for dinner she turned into a long black sexy dress, was excited when during the nighttime walk by the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were taught the ballet test room and she, remembering other times, reached one of the bars and made a secret of 'great ceiling'.
Ines Sastre did not stay on his way by the palace's dependencies, but he previously taught us on his son's mobile phone photos.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the sight with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canoe moving on the bike - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his savannas, his towels and having previously requested that there be no tears in his room.
Stars under the star-stard sky of Paris.
Oh, it's life.
1001, anti-strength number
There is no 1000 but 1,000 more than one way to forget the caottic and frenetic everyday life.
And if it wasn't for a while, they're all assembled in a book that will bring relief to the libraries on 30 September.
The awakener almost gets punished every morning at 7:00 a.m., but it's even worse to imagine being surrounded by the fast pace that pushes the current life.
The office is called tension and the back pain computer.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is not one or two ways to combat daily abuse and the problems of unconnected contact with the working world.
No, the number goes up to, nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Alongside the yoga positions, the classic massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers on the pages of a book a 'menu' of possibilities adapted to each taste and minute.
The works are called '1001 ways to relax' and their peace will come to the libraries of the editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone thinks it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' undermines such faith.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as contacting nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the sofa, disconnect the mind and concentrate on reading.
Speaking Sleepy Talks
Some kids talk at night.
I'm not referring to those who wake up so excited by telling us something that happened the other day, but to children who are talking about being asleep.
The first time you did the best you did, you took a stick, but it doesn't really matter.
It's a benign change in the dream that's called dreams.
It's quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of them told you he talked to you last night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadic (one time in life for example associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month in a monthS...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other changes in sleep, such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (to be sleepy) or sonambulism, but it has no reason to be.
As we mentioned earlier, they can also be associated with very high fever tables, stressful situations or overexcitement.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
He may speak in a tone of quiet voice, quiet words, a smile or anything else (cryings, applause, long speeches...).
In cases where the demonstration is very intense, it should be observed and consulted with a specialist, to see if there is any issue that is causing much anxiety and gives you a way out of this.
We have said that it is a benign change, so it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another change in the dream that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with the apnea of the dream or a frame of stress).
What can be done is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to encourage the child too much before going to sleep.
So seek quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are scared or a little violent.
With very nervous children and who need to relax very much, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire some inner peace.
This will help the child to have a quieter dream.
Once dreams appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day you will not remember anything about what happened.
Useful Tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's not aware, and you'll break his dream.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are very upset during several episodes you should consult or find out what is causing so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common), do not hesitate to ask him to give you information.
You won't get anything, because being asleep doesn't know how to organize your thoughts.
You will also hear what he says, but you don't know what he's dreaming to say, with which he is very careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
You never tell the child you could ask him at night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That is a source of anxiety for children.
In summary, don't worry, it's nothing wrong, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illusion at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the path of victory in its field after a long drought.
Without having done a good game, the team created many times of gol and was able to make a gol to win the game.
The rhythm was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann who shot the team with a long shot, Illhaeusern almost took the "power" and by turn the Funderflick away, then with Hirn up, Romain with the leg or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we didn't let the central champion pass and left only Rihai in position of attack.
The beginning of the second time was crucial, first with two occasions of Rihai and Temporal gol for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illhousians with the gol of Marais, well located to collect the balloon rejected in a first attempt by Diebold (53 ').
But the Illhousiens miner will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be obliged to return to the warehouses a dozen minutes later and leave it to his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and it will not be a problem for the eleven Illhousians who have withdrawn a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after an important paint, the balloon passed very close to the transversal field.
Sarkozy finds angry fishermen
Before moving to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a tour to Britain.
Faced by the demonstration of some resistance by fishermen who strongly disturbed last month's entry from several bridges and normatives, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistre to meet his representatives there on Tuesday morning.
They promised to welcome him " with a constructive spirit " and hoped that he would " come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " created by Breton fishermen in order to achieve measures in response to the increase in fuel prices, which marks a record reaching EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Eliseo David Martin's spokesman, the president " will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses re-competitively and to save the employment and remuneration of mariners " .
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand firm.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to minimize the movement in Morbihan and Calvados, which they have had to do with almost 10 km.
The port of Quebec has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-Isle have not been stopped.
" A filter barrier " has been placed on the peninsula of Quiberon.
The sailors had already demonstrated their determination to burn the moon by firing the white, neummatic and wooden pallets in front of the storage of fuel from the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement was proposed to other ports on the Atlantic coast and Mancha, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, Vandea, where the boats remained at the port, or Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked trade ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loira-Atlantic region, later stopped the blockade of the major Donege Refinery.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer fishermen decided to wait until the meeting of this Wednesday, which will take place in the ministry to think about any action.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by national fisheries committee officers who do not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " fishermen have not left " and " do not want to move to Paris " , for example, Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay fuel charges, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial balance point of a ship can only be reached with a fuel at a price of less than EUR 0.30 per litre.
The Magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two men and a destination " has died from cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.

AIG would want to sell more than 15 % of its assets
The American International Group, which has been removed from debt due to the American monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets with a view to reimbursing its loan of $85 billion, according to the edition of the Domingo of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and pension insurance in the United States, this magazine needs.
The AIG Management Board met last Sunday to consider possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which the AIG intends to separate include its air lease branch, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the Transatlantic Holdings insurance and its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, adds the Financial Times.
No definitive decision has been taken on these sales, persecuted the Financial Times.
AIG must quickly make liquidity in order to repay its 85 billion loan, which was granted by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing the US authorities take 80 % of their capital by way of a proper proportion of current shareholders.
Analysis of the historical session of the Paris Bolza
New York's Bolsa accused a historical fall last month after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or a loss of almost 800 points in Bolsa, and Nasdaq a 9.14%.
The Dow Jones industrial index fell from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important decline in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, or the day on which the exchanges resumed after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, a technological dominant, returned 199.61 points to 1,983,73 units and the standard & Poor's (extended) index 500 to 8,81 % (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106,55 units, according to the final figures of the closing.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected rejection by the House of Plan Representatives to save banks that would have allowed some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 abstentions, the representatives rejected the Secretary of the US Treasury Henry Paulson's request.
About two Republicans of each three rejected their plan.
"That is not a good sign sent to the market, which is seen by Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of the Financial FTN.
"This shows how much the market counted on this plan," added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would "be too late".
"If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take the lead (the Central Bank of America, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would further open the terms of credit," warned Brian Bethune, Head of the Global Insight Economy and Finance.
And stressing further the sense of urgency, " Every day during which a financial institution falls " in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
After Washington Mutual's collapse last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by its Citigroup rival.
In Europe, the crisis has dramatically accelerated, which has led to emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing "not only a crisis in the United States but a global crisis " , adds the FTN analyst.
The compulsory market has deteriorated dramatically.
The income of the 10-year asset bonus was 3,632 %, against 3,827 % on Friday afternoon, and for the 30-year bonus, 4,161 %, against 4,357 % on Friday.
Obama, winner during the first TV double
In the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House, there was another opportunity to find out who had won between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Not surprisingly, the general quarters of the Republican and Democrat campaign announced their own victory in this television double that has been followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, was not "too bright" to allow him to sink into the five-week polls of the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose poll of public opinion published last Saturday, gives five points of advantage to Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), considers it to be the democracies that went well.
Among the undecided voters, who are accountants, Obama was awarded a winner with 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them granted McCain win, according to a CBS survey.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his own candidate, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
" It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
It has good intentions," however Bill Clinton predicted this weekend.
The seven-year-old McCain highlighted his indisputable experience with foreign policy, stressing the "individuality" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first stage.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." accused several times.
" I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president," he also assured.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in public television advertising.
Obama underlined that he was representing the future.
Without disclosing, it was shown to be reasonable and precise.
He realized his ability to make good decisions and to restore the image of the United States to the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done it," he replied, at the end of this week, a democratic television advertising that accused the Republican of not having considered the impact of the crisis on the United States " .
" During the nine minutes of the debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, complains Obama yesterday, before 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a cold rain.
He did not say the words "medium class" or "workers." "The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the most capable person to save the economy on the basis of the principle.
"The next week could be a decisive episode," he estimated yesterday, the influential and democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an old member of Clinton administration, compared Obama ' s " good economic instincts " with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the democratic candidate, the current financial disaster " is the final outcome of eight years of a poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain " .
Reaffirming that despite the fact that 95 per cent of U.S. taxes would be reduced in spite of Wall Street's elevations, the Senator of Illinois also pointed out that the country's possible energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a security and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear plants from here by 2030.
At the same time, both candidates ignored the issues related to the financial savings plan of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted by the Congress yesterday and extremely unpopular.
"In Minsk, "Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and oppositioners showed Sunday afternoon at the main stage of the Belarusian capital to anticipate the results of the legislation.
Some hundreds of Belarus met on Sunday afternoon from the closure of the electoral centres in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to express their opposition to President Alexandre Loukachenko ' s power: " The dictator has to let go " .
Some recognize that they have not voted: "For what, because they will do what they want with my vote," says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime that has improved foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is ready to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
It wasn't according to the opposition.
" We have been sided by the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the report of the votes," Iouri Potemkine, the EU spokesman for the Democratic Forces, lamented a heterogeneous group of twelve parties.
" It is a cosmetic change, Mr. Alexandre Millinkievitch, former candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidential election and Head of the European Movement, because it is important who holds the votes, and in our home, is the executive power.
If some Members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
" But their entry into Parliament may mean appearances on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. "
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has a lot of debt against Russia, is in crisis, and if we do not reform ourselves, we will be in danger of becoming a guardian of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the electoral process, does not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that the participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalization of the vote with anticipation (26% of the voters in Minsk) promoted manipulation.
"Did you notice the elections? Ask the Social Democratic Leader, Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the electoral centers.
And there will be at least five Members of the opposition to Parliament, who are better suited to power. "
The night's silence comes back in October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased with their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated his 10th anniversary of his foundation yesterday, and his president, Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice because Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
Above all, he regained the public's confidence that he had been seriously vaccinated by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and with the disillusionment of the public, in February 1994, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer occur.
While Judge Krever was late to present his report, certain provinces then formed a committee that aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the committee of Gélineau carried out this mission.
As a result of Gélineau and Krever's reports, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and territories.
" In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, almost 38 per cent of the people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, recalled Decary.
The situation was discouraging.
After much effort has been made to improve the safety of blood products and much work over the years that followed, we have recovered public confidence " , he said, before he said proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94 per cent of the Quebec population was in subsequent confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Decary, however, recalls that " confidence is extremely fragile " .
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we attended in Europe the birth of many cases of the human variant of the disease of the cow, a new variant of the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, account Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
Then we support one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which, when we do not know it and when a serious disease can arise from it, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we establish exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we refused the blood of people who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But a few years ago, it has been demonstrated beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us so that the precautionary principle applied was meaningful."
In 1999 a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: the nuclear acid tests that allow donors to detect directly in their blood the presence of the virus and not the anti-virus antibodies, in which the tests used have so far been based.
Nuclear acid tests allowed the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We can reduce this period for a period of less than one week.
We therefore substantially reduce the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements allowed a significant reduction in the risk of contracting AIDS by blood transfusions.
Today, every 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV - contaminated blood.
"That means that you will have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before it can overcome a case of HIV transmission by a blood product.
I believe that today it is possible to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without worry," says Hema-Québec's head.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
It's never known which pathogen could emerge from the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Reunion which, for example, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
Hema-Québec must be constantly vigilant ", pursued by Dr. Décary before he underlined that in addition to a safe supply, hema-Québec should also provide for sufficient supply.
" The needs increase because the elderly population.
Since most aggressive anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a red blood cell or platelet injection.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the network of blood donors that regroups only 3 per cent of Quebecs eligible for blood. "
All persons with good health, 18 years of age and who meet the criteria of admission may, however, donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
In the medium term, 14 per cent of those who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travel to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we can keep an inventory covering the needs of hospitals.
The pennies are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew members of this donor network as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it's hard to convince people to give their blood, but above all, to keep them and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since the current life is very defrosted, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving your blood," hurts Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million per year, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone, heart valves, eye globes and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was previously considered biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of mother cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
" We have celebrated a few weeks ago, the deposition in the bank of our sweetest sample of umbilical cord blood and more than a thousand of these are expected every year.
We should start proposing it for injections at the beginning of next year ", Dr. Décary needs to describe this heart-blooding program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed at not being able to enjoy this " because Hema-Québec does not have resources to propose this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softbol - The Impact on Semifinals
The Montreal Impact was qualified for the semi-finals of the first USL series, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 in final summary) victory on the side of the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during the second and decisive part of the final quarter series, in the Saputo Stadium.
The central champion Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without a gol on either side, the central champion David Testo and Rocco Plantentino created many times of gol.
Roger Levesque was the only one who devastated Matt Jordan by the Sounders.
We recall that during the first part of the series of the parties went and returned, Friday, the impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the Suburban of Seattle.
The impact will be measured at the Whitecaps of Vancouver in semifinals.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, Thunder lost 3-1 in the return party to take it for 4-3, but the Whitecaps did not have access to the semifinals for 5-4.
The impact should be faced with Whitecaps by Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short – The victory goal of Kovalev
The third number of Canadians is ready to start the season.
The composite unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack on a Canadian 3-2 win for the free barrel shots in front of the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a hole, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev took a step in this achievement, the Tricolor room in six preparatory parties.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, before the Russians.
"I need another party to feel comfortable."
He tried to play the top of the first time, noted Guido Carbonneau.
But I think I appreciated the end of the game.
I had a beautiful ovation."
Charest takes care of the North
The first Minister does not only launch elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) tried to be elected during the partial election of today.
Renew the limits of our last large northern border ": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force remaining on the big lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis yesterday.
After him, during his speech, images were designed.
On three large screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric packaging, mineral exploitation, from Quebec, viewed by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means such as during the electoral period.
The first minister believes that the elections will take place this autumn, although he saw that his time was very full.
The " North Plan " is the fourth side of a " vision" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, the " new economic space " , which includes an agreement on working hand with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the first Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The first Minister was limited, however, to explain why North was " an immense potential joy " but he did not give a term, investment amounts, or a specific priority in future projects.
What could be most developed is, in particular, hydroelectricity, forest, but above all the mining sector, which is driven by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, five, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond " , according to Mr. Charest ' s enumeration.
This "field twice as large as France " is our home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it's in us," he insisted, as to show that he asked for a national founding myth.
Quebec was built very much thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the laughing towards gold in Abitibi, the Czech engineering, the Bahía James.
"We belong, it's our future," he added, after having taken a theatre break to look at the vast map behind it.
The North, 70% of the Quebec territory, includes part of the Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, specified the first minister during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a border line in which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion is presented, repeat that position on the part of the Government " , he said.
In addition, " with climate change, we need to reflect on our North vision," he said about the way to the northeast, which will open each year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers it a duty to occupy the territory.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The first Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (formerly former member of the Québeque party of Ungava), have already begun consultations with about thirty communities.
A interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role to play.
The first Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " but a meeting in which " a common vision " will be given.
The development of the North would be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be coordinated, orderly and respectful of the environment " , he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is continuing with the first liberal ministers who preceded him.
" As the Liberals who preceded us, we have thought of another way to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring weekend issues that began Friday with a great cocktail to underline the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes rebaptizing the Central Beauharnois in Embalse Adélard-Goodbout.
"From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the peaceful revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa which made the Bahia James our party intended to forgo the future," Juan Charest said.
At the press conference, he called for another reference, which was conservative, John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" programme, the first minister from 1957 to 1963.
Speaking on the theme of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric packaging project, Mr. Charest stressed that his position in service is foreseen for 2012.
"This remains between us, but I hope to be there," he confided to his soldiers, raising applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and no doubt not in 2009, did not deny the possibility of making a vote on this autumn, which the law permits.
He points out that his schedule is still full, especially because of a mission from the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
At the end of the week, the General Council provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, in particular " constitutional aspirations " which had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec, in particular, called for the recognition of " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
She also wishes that Quebec appoints members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and that they have a right to vote on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcome the large lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the North Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If I had done so, "we'd have made progress today" Mrs. Marois commented next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that took place today), Françoise Mercure.
The Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a North Plan by the Government.
"But what you want is that this isn't just a show," commented leader Sebastian Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letter - A Misspelled Nation
He is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh irony!) at Harper's office, which was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "professional" for Canada.
That is how this woman who has led an inexorable fight for justice and deserves all our admiration what she says all about the relations between the prime minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not returned to its country which is closed to the Guantánamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that were charged with his crimes occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada had signed the Geneva Convention, renewed its promise and left a child- soldier under inhuman conditions.
The only one who deals with a false justice to assess the accused's guilt.
We recall that UNICEF, International Amnesty and the Canadian Lawyers Association, in particular, support Omar Khadr's repatriation in order to enjoy the benefits of an equitable process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not matter to you that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of excavation.
We are still not aware of that, but we are currently witnessing an indiscriminate erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and has no meaning.
The time has come when there is no more morality: we can abuse, torture, arbitrary imprisonment of a Canadian citizen as the head of government has so far been a minority (what will happen after 14 October ?).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that praises the virtue, the Law and the Order: I do not see that this government has abandoned what it has done to our country's reputation and dignity.
Mr. Toews' shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold Orwelliano speech
In its September 17th edition, Le Devor published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President and Director of the Canadian Miner Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold says that the largest aurifer company in the world attempted a process of disfamation of six million euros against three authors and a small editorial house with a view to triggering a " transparent public debate " .
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of persecution by defamation, but the law.
No wonder this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr Garver.
Why, says Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his?
The outcome of the dispute is of little importance, the authors and editor of the book Noir Canada should spend considerable amounts in order to prepare their defence and to fight, with very different weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by almost mineless bottles.
The tactics, in these unequal struggles, are often aimed at destroying the applicants with a view to imposing an friendly settlement that will deter the opposition, in addition to threatening anyone to reexamine the matter.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public opinion that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are usually done by exchange of ideas and not by beatings.
It was enough for the miner to open up his books, his delegates and establish a genuine debate through newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent search teams that could have clarified the matter.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to rely on public opinion and rejects requests and support cards for Noir Canada's authors.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he could ask for a "public" debate, ignoring this opinion?
According to the vice-president, this term seems to refer only to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians, which is a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, tractors also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada is doing it primarily because it refuses the brutal way of mining.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but having as a basis civilized change of arguments, and not in the context of what many people see as a persecution-of-mortality (the " public debate " pursues, Barrick Gold has just filed a claim with regard to the authors of Noir Canada, hoping they will no longer use this word).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university search and truth, essential for all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that discourage the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under many persecutions, who can?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has known for a long time how to manage debates and disputes and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's demeaned persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he is saying, he does not want to make a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put devices that limit this kind of abuse.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the heads of Congress, while both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan that seeks to bridge the financial crisis that struck Wall Street a month ago has yet to be confirmed by both Congress Chambers.
In particular, it provides for a better control by the elected members of its implementation, new mechanisms aimed at ensuring the repayment of the public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of households charged with the lack of payment, as well as a right of taxation on wages paid to managers of the firms involved.
The US Secretary of Treasury, Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day negotiations.
"We are making great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
" Everything has been done to cover the economy and the United States of America before the current Wall Street crisis," the Democrat explained.
"This is the main point: if we don't do this, traumatism, chaos and disturbances about the daily life of the United States will be enormous," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last hours because they feared the effect that would create a new failure in investors' humor.
The last time they had been set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the US presidential elections, which had joined the negotiations later, proved to be more favourable to the agreement, without forgetting to express their disappointment that they were obliged to reach this end.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama was entrusted with certain provisions to reach the agreement, in particular that would enable owners to keep their home and the salaries of the heads of surviving companies by the State.
" When the contributors are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibleness of some, there is no need to congratulate them.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, asked another chain to know if I would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
"The important points I read [show] that it is something that we will have to say and with which we can move forward.
He said that the option of not doing anything is unacceptable."
The plan of 700 billion is intended to buy with the taxpayers' money the suspicious debt, risk assets and irresponsible from the US financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the establishment of an real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of mortgage credit before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and causing a freeze of liquidity and a downturn of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of Republican voters who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have been out of shock since democracies have accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only guaranteed by the government, rather than purchased.
With the aim of taking the savings for the world at the Congress, we also added a provision which provided that if the Government had to assume losses for five years with this programme, it could impose new rates that would help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion million which may be added to 100 billion others if it appears necessary to the President.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote on the Congress.
Instead of its aid, Washington will obtain participation in the subsidiary companies that will divide it into profit and that will be able to sell again when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility of deferring the procurement procedures relating to housing acquired with real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on remuneration and metal compensation paid to managers of companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it subject to the vote of the House of Representatives since today and the next Wednesday at the Senate.
Despite all its efforts, it is still not sure that its plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest against this project yesterday, both by the Republicans and by the Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the camera finance commission, told his voters that " Washington clearly doesn't want to understand " .
" We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But it is not what is involved in taking advantage of the contributors. "
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is the sponsor of a small group at Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
" Four hundred economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote us to say that we asked Congress not to appreciate and carefully consider the way to take," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we had another test of the global nature of the crisis.
Following an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group by EUR 11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention by the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas learned that it had been refusing to buy its competitor in cash since it had lost $2 billion (US$2.9 billion) during the crisis of the U.S. real estate loans.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and of the ten largest insurance companies.
"This is not money lost, the Dutch Minister of Finance Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we recover a right of vote in the bank and influence.
It is just something that rescuers and families will now appreciate that times are uncertain."
During this time, on the other hand, the British Government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would be responsible for all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank and over EUR 41.5 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander told me yesterday that it was the one that would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, which the British government would have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death from a committed icon
Their blue eyes represented their triumph for so long.
The American actor with an exciting smile had been released from his narcissist side?
Yeah and no.
His dust, his sensitivity, and a talent that was evident would also have removed him from the record of power which has the true sacred monsters.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman died last Friday, at 83 years of age, due to lung cancer in his joint of Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American film of the fixed years.
It's less phenomenal than Brando, who looked very much and who was long considered a rival in the film, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of the freedom and stability of the dramatic conventions.
The mixed blood often makes great children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, the father of a German German father and mother of Hungarian origin.
Of these European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream will be born.
Without me measured, last quality brand.
Because it was designed by an all-embracing country of itself made hand, of the fighter of the war of the Pacific, who at the beginning of the 50s studied dramatic art in Yale, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before attending the theater, television and soon in the cinema.
This man who fought for civil rights was also the second-class car pilot in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a six symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and compromised star also disappear with him, allergic to the world scandals of the show that we do not know very well.
He's an honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death caused the Vertigo to the filmmakers this weekend, while their big papers are being dragged into the black screen of the memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in the ever-changing change through it.
Many memories come back to memory as the Cowboy with affection for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Cata on the adapted Zinc tea of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we call out to his sensitive Mr Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that does not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone through film history.
This criminal, tormented, violent boxer at Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hate), by Robert Wise, a paper for James Dean, repeated after his death, which really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic manoeuvre in The Sting (El Golfe), Oscar in 1973.
Player of bitter billiard and winner in The Hustler de Robert Rossen (1961), will repeat the character in The Color of Money of Martin Scorse, which was valued in 1987 by his only Oscar among nine nominations.
This face that changes with years, it was him.
He's still alive.
The times change during your career.
Young people know it especially thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a little orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans returned to see him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With the last role of Irish mafia's homeland on Road to Loss of Sam Mendes in 2003, the rice was painted.
Unlike several film readers who left the race quite soon, Newman remained very much in the film world, accusing Hollywood, his gold, his pillars and concessions.
French cinematographer Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, " as a challenge living in " subplaying " and judging its benefits too well supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman who had come to the papers for a long time without doing anything.
However, he often interpreted the role of young galan rather than marginally: neurotics, alcoholics, cabrons or desperate ones whose traits reflected rebellion.
As a performer, Newman revealed his true puddle sensitivity to the unknown.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife, Joanne Woodward, described a female melancholy portrait.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdose gave him his film Harry and Son in 1984, work of dust and sadness.
" Among the many men who landed for Newman yesterday, his great friend and former arms colleague Robert Redford (who had worked together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very sad: " My life and my country were better thanks to his existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the failed actor.
On the other hand, on the other hand, there is also a large military force for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant against Hollywood's excess.
We'll have seen many of your face ruling over the vingreta salsa boats, salsas, gallates and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it started as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to its Children's Fund in difficulty.
Newman, rather than enjoying his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: " Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And it's a privilege for us to have followed the career of an American artist so luxurious and so generous.
In summary, a citizen model.
What did they produce in the Zuschlag &amp; invoice factory Co. ?
Soon, on 8 October, the criminal process will begin against János Zuschlag and its complications.
It is accused of the policy and its complexity of committing significant damage fraud, businessly, continuously and in the form of organized crime in addition to other crimes, including falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor ' s Office, the funds obtained in public tenders were used for their own purposes by justifying on many occasions the performance of work with false invoices.
The public funds and the associations - in total some 65 million HUF - took part in the treasurery of the Fiatal Balldal organization and part in the pocket of individuals.
The method, which was also known by the researchers, was to justify the cost of the funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices that were not carried out after which there was no real execution, and the different associations had never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the charge, most of the invoices were false.
To that end, the talent was obtained on the market of the Józsefváros District and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question of which company should carry out the falsified invoice was decided among others in that direction by the Balatón Upper Region where János Zuschlag sent to István Lados.
This last acknowledged that for this purpose guests and restaurants should choose.
He requested invoices for his consumption and they served as a model for the invoices presented among others in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social and Labor, and the Capital Union.
These invoices were signed in most of them by István Lados and his complicity András Óri, who, according to our best information, wrote the reports needed to obtain public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Lados chose a beer.
According to two invoices sent in 2003 by Zuschlag and its complications, this gastronomic centre provided food for a group of 90 people from the Bistos Pontos Egyesület Association.
However - according to the center manager - many people don't get there at the same time.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jötőrt Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
Because a host of Badacsonytomaj's premises had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there on one night, but the invoice consisted of hundreds and thirty persons.
But great fantasy invoice manufacturers also exceeded when they pointed to the Pigal Kft Gastronomic Center. Because in the bookstore of the same - according to the information given to Fiscalía - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jövőret and Hoppa.
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, informed hvg.hu that when he was mentioned by the tax office and showed him the invoices, he knew it was false documents.
"In the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: In addition to formal problems, he also did not agree that hundreds of people were accommodated by the invoice, since they only have 11 rooms in which so many people do not belong.
In addition, the invoice also included food, while the restaurant does not work for some time.
The invoice manufacturers were also not informed that the travel agency selected in Budapest only organises trips abroad, so that in the actual payment bill they indicated a travel service in Hungary, which was not in line with the agency's invoice delivery practice.
In addition - as is claimed during the investigation - they also included VAT in the document, although travel outside the territory of the European Union were tax exemptions.
Among other things, the measure of VAT was also incorrect in the four documents sent by the Hotel Revfüllöp Kft. for the foundation Jobb Jöőret, since the services of that company are not charged with a 25 but only 15 per cent VAT, and the employees of the hotel only extended invoices made to the machine but the invoice was manual.
In addition, "sendors" also made other errors, such as in the case of a company which placed in the invoice as a road transport activity to which - it is assumed during tax investigations - does not perform the company based as an investment consultant.
Also by formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false seal - it is assumed that the invoices sent to Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvány, to XXI. Századi Culturals Egyesület and to Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Konfehertó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to send these invoices.
The falsifiers also did not pay attention to the fact that when the Fiatal Városéret Egyesület group was eating there (2001), Nyíregyháza HIB Kft was in the liquidation process, so the charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - had refused to send such a document.
The invoices were issued on a conscious basis
Another group of manufacturers of false invoices are those who were aware that they should send fictitious invoices.
The Fundação Esély Budapest , at the request of Fiatal Balodal - Ifü Socialistak, issued invoices worth about four million HUFs in the name of the Fundação Együtt in Harmadik Évezredt.
To the manager of the Collab Kft. - according to the charge - one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, agreed to send fictitious invoices.
Similarly, she collaborated with Zuschlag and its complications the Biogate Kft., currently under the liquidation process, which in 2003 provided invoices for an estimated five million HUF value to the Foundation Jobb Jöőret Alapitvány , the Association Atlasz Egyesület and the Association Vörösfenyő Egyesület , without real economic activity behind .
There was no capital movement either, since later they cancelled the prepared invoices but forgot to make their documents available to this entity.
The following group of false invoice manufacturers includes those who have any connection with the accused.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the Ukrainian administrator of the Delta Trio SL with a fictitious headquarters in Budapest, which dealt with fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices for an estimated 18 million HUF in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of IT.
According to research data, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Ltd. from Kiskunhalas, which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a brother to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also disclosed documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that it issued invoices for the company atlasz, for Hoppa and for Együtt to Harmadik  Évevesredert Alapitvány covering the amount itself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian Albanians at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies worked effectively because - according to the accused - they did not receive work.
But he benefited from these companies, since, at the request of his complicity, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration papers, sent invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations associated with Zuschlag: for the Atlas and for the Y Generation.
Kubatov, on behalf of the Cash Investment, the Delta Trió, the Fa-Bani Jos Investment, the Jos Investment and the Linaxtrade gave total 15 invoices to different entities with a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The Authority considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
This man even used the Szi-Beri command company to send fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont competition.
The Y-Generation and Society of Modern Hungary presented a competition in January 2006 at Táncsics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
They obtained 500 thousand HUFs from the competition respectively, but did not use the money for the purpose of the competition.
In order not to discover this, they presented to the TMA five fictional invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the discrepancies record that Arpád Kemexei held at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the accused will probably report in court - as they did in the prosecutorial office - the course of fraud of invoices.
The most interesting can be the confession of the main prosecutor, János Zuschlag, if he decides to disarm everything.
Because their confessions have so far not been very detailed and although he has repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so far.
The question is: What interest should you have to do?, because perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - 50 million HUF - socialists have come to an agreement with him to assume all the responsibilities of Zusi.
Who, on the other hand, for these days was able to defend himself, since in order to ease his prison conditions he requested domestic arrest, but he was repeatedly denied it.
While the numerous authors of highly valuable economic crimes, who have never returned the money, are free to spend or at least can wait in their own home of judgment, he does not have the possibility to do so.
Psychology of Overposts: Why do we spend more money?
The participants in the subsists are willing to spend more money and overestimate the product.
The neurologists and economists of New York University discovered the neurological bases - economics of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study in Science magazine, people don't want to lose their competitions like eBay's substars, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "play" by means of experimental subassays.
One group of volunteers played lotterys, the other participated in a substation and while both reviewed the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment through the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI).
In both games participants could earn money, but during the subastations, where it is essential to play more than the other, at the loss of the game, the operation of the complex called strata located below the brain cortex was intensified.
This brain area, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "primary car" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in lead levels is explained as a prevention to avoid an intense reaction to the strategist.
In order to base its theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment, three groups set themselves against a person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its constituents set out.
Another group was promised that if they won, they would receive $15 more.
On the contrary, the third group received $15 just before the subsidized, but in case the subsidized group members lost even that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by checking neurologists' assumptions, the members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to pose even more than the members of the control group and the "winner".
"These results cannot be deduced from any previous economic theory.
For those who have so far explained the phenomena of subsists only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so that we now come to a third explanation" - Andrew Schutter, professor of the economic capacity of New York University.
Hepatitis: When should you go to your doctor?
In the world some 50 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and chronic liver disease in Hungary is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of infections in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many patients do not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; they are characteristic of liver infection and icterity, but their pathogenic agents and the occasional diseases are very different.
Hepatitis virus depending on the pathogen is spread through two main forms: hepatitis A and E via food (e.g. with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body humour (sperm, vaginal humour, saliva).
Travelers are recommended to be protected by vaccine against viruses A and B, against C no vaccines are available.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consumption of the infected food, manifested by a general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After this they appear in the skin and in the white of the eyes, icterity, excretion becomes clear, dark color urine and treatment may last even two - three weeks.
Each year, one million people die in the world from cancer and hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in ten infected people receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: without treatment it may cause hepatitis C and even cancer.
Most of the infected do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent in the form of pautine destroys the liver cells and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
Therefore, early recognition, systematic medical control is very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can also be discovered with routine laboratory control, it is worth consulting your family doctor when you experience some unknown symptoms.
The disease is treated if it is discovered in time, it is possible to eliminate the organism's virus, thus eliminating the infection and preventing cancer.
On 30 September, the World Day of Hepatitis was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients.
Its objective is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of early recognition.
Do you feel sorry for those who believe in God?
According to a recent study, religious faith has a soothing effect that also alleviates the death of Catholic martyrs.
The scientists at Oxford University performed an interesting experiment: they analyzed how religious belief affects human pain - reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
Within this unique experiment they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and to the same number of atheists, while they were all looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
As a result, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scan technique, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for controlling pain.
This experiment is the first of a series of research studies involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from the various departments of the University.
The analysis took place in the following way; they set up an instrument pointing to the patient's left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings; the Virgin Mary, the work of the 17th century Sassoferrato and the Dama of the army of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the show at the Virgin Mary would cause a certain religious spirit among the faithful, as long as they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had a soothing effect.
Patients spent half an hour in an MRI scenario, receiving 20 electrical shocks in four successive parts while observing the painting of a religious theme or either.
Catholics said that when they looked at Virgin Mary they felt "safe" as "protected" people," "they were calmed down and peace was restored in their hearts."
When they observed the religious theme, they felt about 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, believes that with any such an impactable image a similar effect can also be achieved with the atoms, it is only necessary to find the appropriate image.
"We should find the portrait of a person who feels very positive, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The English bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases truly change our personality," Wright added.
After these terrible results, there is only one question: What would be the effect on the treatment of pain if the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of its size were shown to faithful ones?
Would the vision of a High-quality Virgin Mary bring even better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
In its tenth birthdays, Google can say: you can be found both in the people's pocket, as well as in the sky above your head; you know where your holidays were, what doctors are visiting and what interests them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is not enough.
On the other hand, the sceptics that make a parallel with the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated in the Financial Times magazine that Google's main goal is to collect as many personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary in order to achieve the original goals of Google's founders: "We gather all the world's information!".
According to Google's leader, the company even after ten years of work that has been around the world is still in the initial phase of the effort to deal with all the information.
To the question what will happen within five years Schmidt replied as follows: I would like Google to answer questions like "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job that would best suit me?" - however, the software will not be able to answer questions as simple as it appears while there is no information available to users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their browsing on the Network, the keywords sought, IP addresses and pages where the search ended.
Thanks to the example of Personalized Search that started two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, see what they were looking for before, what they opened up and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized search - in this same logic will be based on the Recommendations, where the system will offer us products and services based on the previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if they use my data against me, if they collect information about my activities? - they ask those who are concerned about Google's information monopoly.
In most cases the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is already confirmed that they do not only preserve, but in case of justification, they also assign to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of Internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government information on its website, Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
On the other hand, Internet users who were concerned about human rights were relieved in May when the company with the EFF, an organization for the protection of electronic rights, demonstrated successfully to the court that it had reason to argue with the FBI: it is considered that Google will not be obliged to provide any information requested under the constitution by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government was able to achieve its prerequisite for strengthening the child protection law adopted years ago, about fifty thousand web addresses and some thousands of searched phrases, but without obtaining individual user search lists, nor complete web pages and keywords lists of the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory about Google: those who fear to provide their personal data are critical of it because they think that their privacy is damaged, their private life when they start using Google's services, and they rebel against it as against the multinational companies of conservative image.
Meanwhile, the North American geek culture and its enthusiasts, Internet users and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "Vanguarding Corporation", not its rival, Microsoft, which is categorized by its Windows as the winner of the World, because they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and seems more young, more cooperative than the official software giant practice.
But it can also be because the geeks are precisely the very problematic relationship between people's rights and the Internet that has been created just by one of the most key words mentioned in recent years: Web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intended needles behind us and using available communication channels, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: to show ourselves.
A normal youth can have a profile on many collective pages, from Facebook to Yanga, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that provides list of their music habits, then they can be included in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also have a blog where the latest photo gallerys are automatically stored in Flickr or Picasa.
We can know a number of cases of those who learn that for example the bride, when she saw the stream of photos of the next morning of the common friends, she became aware of who had spent the night her false boyfriend or they could leave the employee of a company because she writes her sincere opinion on the company's management blog: one thing is sure, the definition of private life was fully evaluated.
A person's "on-line" life is what she shows herself - this is the definition that is hidden behind the behavior of our youth today.
And whatever you want to hide something, or at least want to mislead Google's monopolies, you can do it (e.g. starting with the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but don't leave holes).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to avoid finding them, but they can replace Google's "online" applications, from text editing software to image and reading news applications with alternative versions which are not connected with giant servers or prepare the best possible profile on us.
The public opinion looks forward to almost the day when Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AddSense advertising sites threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, while services that are increasingly introduced cause serious head pain not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
However, critical observers will also find alarming contradictions: for example, the senior director rejected employees' protest roundly after doubleing the price of the company's childcare, they considered too much to be the limited number of employees' food, but all of this was nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave up pressure from the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement filtered all information that violated the good moral and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when they are already ready to work, which is sure is that the foreseeable problems in the coming months and years can turn around the world: while some believe that Google's project of screening and file of books and magazines will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the Supreme Court of the United States, others fear its system for its health, because in it we can create our own comprehensive health profile, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, you can provide a good raw material for science writers fiction, the Scroogled, novel of Cory Doctorow's populace, describes this future in an orwellian way, in which only a man of Google's data can be described alarmably well.
Two minors helped remove the needles to the author of the second murder of the city of Ozd.
The police asked two minors about the double murder of Ozd who, according to the underlying suspect, helped eliminate the crimes - the spokesman for the General Order Commission of the province of Borsod said Tuesday.
Young people recognized the crime that had been imposed on them, and they are now accused of crime-factors.
The two minors - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency about two girls - can be defended in freedom.
By the complexity you can receive up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The accused of the double murder of Ózd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pretrial detention since Sunday.
He is accused of killing several people with premeditation and by code.
During the research, it was found that a 23-year-old owed a high sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so the Wednesday of last week quoted his creditor at the headquarters of an Ozd company, where he killed him and then also killed the 9-year-old victim's daughter.
According to information from the IMI, the young man was prepared to commit the crime long before, as he committed murder with a weapon previously hidden in the scene of the crime.
The police are analysing with a gun expert and the circumstances of their use.
The Bolsa de Warsaw presented an offer to buy the Bolsa de Prague
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech Crowns - by hundreds of hundreds of shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, although the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Bolsa is in the hands of the state.
The 99 per cent of the actions are in the hands of the Polish State which, within a few months, wants to sell 60 per cent of the same.
The Czech Economic Journal E15 reported that the Polish offer has been the highest among those offered by stakeholders by the Prague Bolza.
According to the Czech press, so far they have offered the Bottle of Vienna, the Transatlantic Bottle of Nasdaq, the Stock Exchange of New York, the Bottle of London and the Deutsche Börse.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Valores Ball last week, declared that among the most interested the new owner would be the Warsaw Valor Ball and did not deduce the possibility that, in the future, the Prague Valor Ball would disappear.
Experts estimate the value of Prague's Bolsa in some 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, about 90 per cent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patricia Finance with a participation of about 25 per cent, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday's most profound international financial crisis speak of a "second 11 September".
The overall financial disaster is due to the President of the United States - La República de Rome - the President has not been able or even to obtain his own party's support for the draft law that has been enforced, whose aim is to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new Pearl Habor, which spoke by the multimillionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more right to speak of a "second September 11th".
According to part of the Madrid press, Washington is the expiatory key.
In The World's view, the failure of the political leadership of the United States was what led to the global economy on the edge of ambition.
More and more the danger of the depletion of the North American monetary system and then, it will affect the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the Congress's vote, the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The global economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the largest changes in capitalism history is being made.
There is no way to ignore this threat - point out the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still draw you out of saving funds to tambaleant financial institutions, thus saving them from fraud with taxpayers' money.
But if the domains are still more bankrupt, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be sufficient.
It is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to abandon their nationalist selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received only more than 100 billion euros a month - he recalls the coming Der Standard, adding that the concerns that, as the North Americans did, European taxpayers should also pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has not so far been seriously concerned with the crisis that is happening as a result of the Old Continental Age .
"savers" will not have to immediately submit hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: In what cases is it justified to use taxpayers' funds to avoid further harm?
The smart car imitates the flight of the bee
What would be the best way to develop technologies to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of existing obstacles in nature?
For example, he is one of the good-doers.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the volunteers gave Nissan engineers a starting point to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the robotic driving system of type BR23C models of nature, which gave him the characteristics of the well-being, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can mislead all colleges.
During the flight each evening, he created his own dedicated private space that actually looks very much like our security security cap – explained at the Kazuhiro Doi exhibition, Technological Director of RP and Development and Research.
They play an important role in the eyes of the wells who are able to see in all directions in an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eyes, engineers used the measuring system of length by laser rays.
This identifies the obstacles before the BR23C within a distance of 2 metres, in an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of the vehicle which immediately turns into a manual to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds, the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle's robot imitating the movements of the bees, changing the direction by turning to the necessary extent the wheels.
Unlike any system currently in existence, this manoeuvre is totally instinctive.
"If not, the vehicle's robot could not react with enough speed to escape obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and in an instinctive way, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the security capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what makes an improvement so that other improvements can be lost.
This process must be performed in an open and close.
However, unlike the wells, the movement cannot go up, down or diagonally, but can only be bidimensional and solely in the direction of the wheels
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available for the well-being of other well-being, they used here only as a possibility for the car's robot the rotary movement and acceleration as well as the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and are higher in energy density, which means they have a longer life span than lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, it is important that the instinctive and intelligent reaction is not the ability to process data, nor much less the storage capacity.
This device in each second should only process some input signals and react as appropriate.
There is no need to store these data or react with an instinct logic based on the data of the previous manoeuvres, so use only a few decades of memory.
There is no need for memory of gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step towards developing technology to resolve the obstacles immediately, which according to Nissan's calculations, can be incorporated into the models manufactured in series within ten years.
Another possibility for your application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to lead the driver to your destination, ignoring existing obstacles on your way.
He's got a name for this cute kid.
The written version of the financial redemption package of $700 billion has been prepared, which will be applied in several phases with a view to purchasing bank credit.
In the first phase half of the money will be spent.
According to the hour of the East Coast during the new consultations that took place until after Wednesday afternoon, the convention leaders reached an agreement on the financial redemption package of $700 billion in total, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have made significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, a democratic president of the North American Congress, saying that it is only necessary to formalise the agreement in a document.
The commitment made on the package was supported by both the presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the commitment, said that this programme will work and will be effective but more action is needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street but about returning it to the car of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before 8 o'clock in the evening, according to Washington time (or before the two Monday mornings, according to Central Europe time), without causing a spectacular jump in the bags.
On the draft legislation called the Emergency Act for Economic Stabilization of 2008, the first month will vote for the North American Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush consulted with Pelosi on Saturday night and then the White House also held the news on the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made during the night and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
The programme is different from the original Bush administration's proposal to spend all $700 billion on purchasing credit-based securities.
Only half of the 700 billion dollars can now be spent, using 250 billion dollars immediately after the Congress has voted on this amount, probably Monday, the Ministry of Finance will purchase credit-funded securities, ill-qualification and the fate of another 100 billion dollars depending on the decision of the President.
This programme will be controlled by a special agency, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the 700 billion dollars may be spent after a new decision of the Congress.
According to the Act, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combination of tactics: it can simultaneously buy miscellaneous, mortgages and credit-funded securities, as well as other "venous"-type credits.
The purchase may be made either directly or indirectly - inform the competent persons of the ministry.
The Act allows the affected companies to participate in an insurance programme where the financial portfolio guarantees the concerns of which companies will pay the amount corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulson stated: the law thus ensures the necessary financial means, which can reach up to $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the North American financial system, the treatment of the purchase of bad financial means, its insurance or the prevention of risks that could lead to the depletion of some large financial institutions.
We do all we can to be ready to introduce the law as it signed - it added.
Instead, the bank heads who are in trouble and expect State aid may be able to account for the official limitation of their remuneration, which the North American architect simply calls gold parachutes.
Payments will be limited only in certain cases, and limitations will depend on the form of aid from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of a substation, an extra tax will be imposed on gold parachutes unless the failed bank chief is released.
When the government buys bad credit directly, it will act aggressively to ensure that the remuneration of the chiefs is not excessive.
In addition to the above, there will be no change in existing contracts of gold parachutes, the limitations refer only to the new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in North America's history that will be in force a legal limitation on the income of the Directors-General - said Democrat Barney Frank, president of the Congress Commission, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares from participating banks in the programme, thus reducing the risk of contributors, since they can ultimately obtain profits from the transaction in terms of recovery of the economy and the bank.
According to the draft law in the next five years, the President should submit to the Congress a proposal on how to return the losses of the financial sector to contributors.
Of course, both sides had expressed their reservations with regard to the project.
This is not what the North American citizens urged us to do, i.e. they are not protecting the dollars of the contributors - California Republican congressman Darrell Issa said.
His fellow Democrat of Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: the measures forced him to take responsibility for the disintegration of the Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
In August 2008, national industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 per cent compared to last month's prices and by 12.9 per cent compared to the prices of August 2007 - the Central Statistics Office (KSH) reported.
Industrial export prices rose by 1.1 per cent in relation to July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent in respect of previous year.
As a result of changes in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to the previous month and by 3.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
Industrial sales prices have only increased to a minimum, with 0.1 per cent.
Internal sales prices in the processing industry increased at least, with a 0.1 per cent increase in July.
The largest increase in prices occurred in August 2008, in the leather and shoe production sector (2.8 per cent), mainly due to an increase of 4.6 per cent per cent per month in bags and belts and an increase of 2.5 per cent in shoes.
The highest price level of basic plastic and chemical materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical production branch (1.6 per cent).
A price decrease was observed in the petrochemical sector (1.4 per cent), in the production of electrical machinery and instruments (0.9 per cent), as well as in the wood processing sectors (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, editorials and printers have not changed.
In the rest of the processing industry, there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water that represent an important weight within the internal trade, an increase of 0.3 per cent was recorded in August, first due to the impact of the increase in official prices since the first July.
In a comparison of a 12-month period - in national sales of the processing industry - the largest increase in prices was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 per cent).
In the metal manufacturing sector, an increase of 13.2 per cent was observed, while in the food, drink and tobacco industry, a significant increase of 11 per cent was observed.
A decrease in prices was recorded in the textile industry (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and instruments (0.3 per cent).
In the rest of the processing sectors, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
During the past year in the processing industry, prices increased globally by 10.2 per cent.

In August 2008, with regard to the same month of the previous year, the increase in prices occurred in the energy sectors and in the intermediate industry (16.8 per cent).
In the production ranges of consumer goods, a decrease of 6.8 per cent was recorded and an investment asset of 1.4 per cent was recorded.
The export prices of the industry calculated at HUF increased by 1.1 per cent compared to the previous month, and compared with 12 months, there was a decrease of 3.9 per cent.
Our national currency in one month was reduced by 1.7 per cent in terms of the euro and by 7.1 per cent in terms of the dollar, compared with August 2007, by 7.5 per cent in terms of the euro and 15.9 per cent in terms of the dollar.
Will the next year no longer need to be targeted to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there are many possibilities for the North American-Hungary visa eviction agreement to enter into force on 12 January - the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke of it in Chicago, before the Hungarian residents there.
In its opinion " Virtually everything depends on the time-construction of the electronic system of access and control on the other side of the Atlantic".
At the same time he warned that in the new system the entry premium would disappear, but tourists would have to register before their departure from the country of origin.
From now on, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
The Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will be interviewed by handing over the Mediterranean Cross to the Star of the Republic of Hungary's Merit Order and will support negotiations with the international policy advisers of candidates to the Presidency, the Barack Obama Democrat and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of the bank's financial redemption package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates to the presidency of the two large North American parties, assured on Sunday their support for the $700 million administrative assistance programme, but there are politicians that require the Minister of Finance to resign.
The representatives of the Congress and the administration, after negotiations of several days of maraton type, announced on Sunday morning: a principle agreement was reached on the bank's financial redemption package.
The financial package aimed at resolving the Wall Street crisis and decoupling the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to prove that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, when economic issues were first put forward, Obama again gained a certain advantage and disappeared from McCain's advantage after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin's candidate to the vice-presidentship.
In a plot of Detroit campaign on the last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress would soon adopt the law on the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the proposal included those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) is at risk of employment, your savings, as well as entire industries and the stability of the entire economy," said a crowd of 35,000 people.
I did not take advantage of the opportunity to qualify as an obsolete for McCain's economic concepts.
In an interview given to ABC McCain explained that "all of us will bring this to severe punishment... but doing nothing is simply not a viable path."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a control committee to the Minister of Fines and the limitation of the remuneration of executives, which he insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, but he consulted the Minister daily.
Congress President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that Congressmen would probably vote on the bill on Monday.
German-language press magazine
The right group is intact, only within its own group became the most conscious voters - says Der Spiegel on the weak election result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a rojinegro coalition.
Mirror (spigel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-hand magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Revolution of Bavaria Destroys Her Parents" analyzes the reasons for the defeat of the CSU drama.
According to a well-known politician, CSU erosion had begun long before the sad two Beckstein-Huber had taken up his role.
The social Christians for several decades were developing in Bavaria - and right now these modern citizens are the ones who support them.
The change of a era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as is Angela Merkel.
The failure was not completely surprising for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that had been planned for almost ten years: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago , in 1998 the CSU received 47.7 per cent , for the first time under 50 per cent since the fifty years .
This was repeated three years ago in the elections of the Bundestag in 2005, i.e. during the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the subsequent modernization of the CSU in the destroying province of its parents .
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the rate they have made a lot of mistakes. However, secularization, the results of the education and settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the integrity of the CSU electors.
Modernization also increases the possibilities and also has political consequences.
The right group is intact, only within its own group became more conscious, more critical and more tested voters.
It is surprising that in recent weeks the conventional groups of citizens were the ones that left more than the CSU; the autonomouss, the small industrials, those who had Bacillerate and the diplomats.
This has resulted in fewer than 40 per cent of CSU support.
The Press (diepresse.com)
Vienna's Conservative Journal: "Who is with whom? In its article "The Presidents of the parties are very reserved for coalition issues" - it deals with the confusion of internal policy after Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the OVP.
The OVP prohibits SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, green exchanges still do not want to consult on the coalition.
The elections have already been held, now all around the coalition; in the debate on public television, the leaders of the parties have just stopped seeing some of their flags.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SSPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the OVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question standing that if you could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Moreer, the current president of the ÖVP, in the vice-canceller post.
He said that they did not approve Schüssel-Molterer's era in any case.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Moreer reacted cautiously to red offers.
He said that cooperation would certainly not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere with the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
The party is still open if they choose the opposition or enter into the coalition, these issues must undoubtedly be discussed within the own ÖVP.
The president of BZÖ, Jörg Haider, was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to assume the responsibility of the government," Haider said.
Járóka: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has been launched in Paris, and its host is France which is also President of the European Union this year.
Livia Járóka, a member of the European People's Party by the Fidesz, in her full-time message, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, called for attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that afflict Roma children and is also the greatest obstacle to the predominance of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of European governments, social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights protection organizations.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz Group in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, the Roma remain outside the labour market first by their low level of education.
"Most young Gypsies have not finished secondary education and because of the poor quality of basic education, only an insignificant part can get university degree."
Járóka also stressed that education, as fundamental human rights, has a decisive role to play in the predominance of other human rights as well.
Investment in the education of Haitian children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these issues between both the Gitan and the non-Gitan.
As soon as the school begins, a Gypsy student will have more opportunities to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"The Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must ensure their right to quality education and ensure the abolition of secret and low-level education," noted Livia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the European Union's objective and active unit is needed to speed up the process of school disintegration immediately, which is essential for the proper implementation of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, to give the Roma the opportunity to guarantee democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights," Járóka demanded.
The aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized annually since the Berlin meeting last year, which was held on the sign "European Year of Equal Opportunities", is to ensure a single forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level by Member States.
CSU: thanks for a transitional period
At the end of October a decision will be taken on the success of the Huber-Beckstein failure
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut at the tops of the Bavarian CSU, the debate on personal issues has been postponed for the moment.
Erwin Huber, president of the party and Günther Beckstein, the first provincial minister remains in his positions, but he does not know how long the grace will last.
The fate of the second, which suffered a 17 per cent electoral defeat, will be decided at the special convention of the party to be held at the end of October.
The members of the two so criticised were left to intervene: they will not be held to their posts.
They thus sought to calm the angry members of their parliamentary group and its basic organization, who one day after the "baby tsunami" claimed personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the direction of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career - the social union reached a 60.7 percent, in turn, a year after the attack against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent won.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopolio" in Bavaria which gave 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the province of the South, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservationists continue to dominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to associate with someone.
As the first sign of the restructuring of the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of the possible successors of Huber, also has a role in the reduced intelligence group that starts negotiations with the Liberal FDP and the Right-Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about the destination is that in the list of Free Elections, this former Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was used for the attack of the second Huber-Beckstein and then badly deleted from the scene to the ambitious local policy.
The CSU's top leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
The transition will also play an active role in Stoiber that has so far been moving the strings in the fund, the former Provincial Head of Government and former President of the CSU qualified on 28 September as the worst day of his political career.
Monday Huber made some critical comments to the CDU, in his opinion it would have deserved much more support from the party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel himself as well.
Following the election of the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel cannot be dismissed if it is not possible to highlight with CSU that played a transcendental role in the success of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, his failure to hide his disappointment in pain would not have a negative impact on the great Berlin coalition.
What is of course relative: it will not be easier to deal with the injured CSU and the ongoing crisis of social Democrats.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After Sunday's elections, there will be no opposition in the Belarusian Parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability guaranteed in the country by Alexandr Lukashenko, in exchange for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is better explained by the violations of the law committed during the context of the votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the electoral outcome.
Although the legislation of the country of 10 million inhabitants, integrated by hundreds and ten Members, has not been opposed for more than a decade, before the elections of the United Nations Democratic Forces (ODSZ) yesterday, it was hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed its mandate after the 2006 elections of questionable legitimacy, would now "allow the entry of some of the opposition's Members into Parliament.
So the ODSZ deleted the boy who originally wanted to do.
At the bottom of the opposition's expectations was what Belarus, which is increasingly dependent on Russia - which has taken a credit to moderate imports of natural gas increasingly across Russia and which has contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz, owner of gas pipeline across the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not allow it to enter Lukashenko and other high-level politicians to have an anti-democratic political regime.
It was a sign of distance when the OSCE, when assessing the electoral campaign, placed a better focus on positive and non-errorist phenomena - such as the prohibition of participation in taxes to a third of the opposition's candidates.
However, the OSCE's main monthly report even criticised the campaign - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and in particular that opposition could not be present in the content of the votes.
With all this in view of opposition there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, refusing to recognize the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus is theoretically a federal state - has already considered the two regions as independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one forward, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - said our journal Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the 2006 presidential election opposition candidate, it is desirable to maintain this situation, although "the regime is afraid to allow such an opposition to enter that Parliament without weight".
The opposition does not intend to organize protests when it sees the results, but rather tries to reach voters with their message on the need to make economic reforms.
- This is clearly caused by many problems because we have to print the pressure of opposition in Russia, local authorities are making it difficult for them to distribute, but even so I see that they are increasingly those who support the change among older people too - Milinkevich said, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, does not consider it appropriate or even the young people, who are officially the most subsidised by the regime.
Due to the country's debt and the increase in trade deficit, it is only a matter of time that decomposition of social security that "sees to be the silence of cemeteries" - Millinkevich said.
Russian observers against opposition policy qualified democratically for elections.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People don't believe in words but in facts," so that the lack of opposition is nothing but testimony to the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on you're exhausted before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Palacio Chigi who would put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of staff.
But since today it starts with this measure against who goes up and then goes to the bar to take a coffee in working hours.
This novel has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the President of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services," the minister needs.
"Now a new period of responsibility and transparency is opened.
This is Reformism," quoted once again by Brunetta.
Palacio Chigi completes the installation in all the buildings of the President of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
No resistance has been found on the part of employees, the Secretary-General says: "There has been a change shared by workers and there has been cooperation on the part of them".
Finally, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and lunches.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good capuchin at 7:00 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister stated that "in three months the absence of public employees' diseases has been reduced by 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people working in one year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more effective
Italian, "which wage dynamics – explained by the Minister – have been double over the past 8-10 years with regard to the private sector and well above inflation rate".
For now, millions of public employees have joined in opposing the rules of the Brunetta Decree by adding to the request supported by the Codacons.
"As the minister of the Public Service shows the numbers, the less austenism of work due to disease – writes consumer association – the people of 'vago workers' are constantly increasing .
In Italy, there are millions of right and productive public administration employees who have joined together to declare war against the illegal rules of the law."
In particular, the Tar will be responsible for the exclusion of economic treatments collected by disease due to service; the extension of the time-limits in which medical visits are made to the sick employee and other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Labour accidents, Napolitan: "Crucial Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail's data confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the gravity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and cause almost double deaths in respect of homicides.
To draw attention to the institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, Anmil is today celebrating the 58th national anniversary of the victims of labour accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October in all provinces of Italy.
"The worrying data transmitted by Anmil and the same tragic news these days confirm how crucial it is to prevent work," said the President of the Republic of Georgia Napolitan, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association Mutilated and Disabled by Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its "great appreciation for the constant partnership effort in favour of prevention at work, protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and awareness-raising of public opinion".
"It has been shown, a 'beautiful', genuinely shared, in the face of tragedies which, by its size, cause media to cry out and the participation of public opinion, instead of the daily reality offers us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitan does not hide that "there is no doubt a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
In particular, they take the many initiatives promoted in the school area for a more direct awareness-raising of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the attention alive to the phenomenon, not to slow down the alarm on social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
On its part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber has underlined "as the phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency, which violates the conscience of each of us and imposes a decisive commitment on all institutions to bring an immediate end."
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive approach, but this does not make the number of white deaths equally impressive," noted the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "deduction tendency" to be translated into less attention, because it is just when attention is reduced to exploiting the tragedy.
"We believe that at the general level there is still too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be carried out through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our view, to highlight Mercandelli – more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this is from the school world " .
"It is worth further effort - it has been added - to the extent that it concerns the communication and awareness of public opinion.
But it serves, above all, a greater sense of responsibility for employers in relation to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidized protection provided for victims of work" and "assistance to which the system is heading in recent years".
"The aim is to return to the employer the insurance guarantee - it has been aggregated - because the accident of the accident does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator at all times."
Mp3 players under the charge, risk hearing
Listening to high volume music for a long time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent injury to the audience.
This is the case with the European Commission, which, in a communication published in Brussels, refers to the opinion of the Scientific Commission on the emerging and recently identified health risks (Csseri) of the Ue, published today.
"From this scientific opinion – read in the note – it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than one hour a day having the high volume device are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who often use portable music devices and high-level audio phones can unwittingly ruin their ears in an irremediable way," Meglena Kuneva says.
"Of the scientific evidence - continue to be responsible for Ue - poses a clear risk and we must respond quickly.
What counts is awareness of consumers and public domain information.
We need to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they can be comprehensively effective and step up with new technology."
Brussels had requested the Independent Scientific Committee to consider the problem, seeing the large use of portable music equipment and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that is causing it.
"Scientists - which concludes Executive Ue - confirm that it is a cause of concern and the European Commission will now consider with the Member States and interested parties measures that may be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and related devices."
At present, there is already a European security standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but concerns increase as the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit many of these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and timing of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee Ue notes that users of portable musical equipment are listening to high volume (less than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limit of the maximum noise allowed at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for longer periods are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This means that between 5-10% of users of such devices can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the UE.
Rome, Germany leads the Commission to the future of capital
Today, in March it will be closed, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the calendar established by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which has been established this morning at its new headquarters behind the terms of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the meeting and the community council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the strategic plan for Rome with the "official good" of the Municipality and its intention Gianni Germano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – tending to underline Germany – It will be necessary to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who choose politically, together with the municipal council can then be assessed.
There is no position on roles, only the will to have a place where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March the work will disappear, as this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June – announces the intention – we will present the strategic plan using the Commission's work for the future of the capital of Rome.”
He who accuses the Commission of useless, given that its opinions are not binding, Germany replied: "All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as will France with the Italian Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
It is almost always a matter of policy in normal management and emergency situations that are again manifested.
On the contrary, we want to look more there and for a long time, in a deeper perspective, working seriously towards the development of Rome and its future."
The intention of Rome is also to point out that "this Commission is not a useless entity or a charity: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to Roman citizens and it will serve to participate and reason on the best minds expressed by capital".
For Germany, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or impossible, to allow our city to make a genuine level jump, of which we have absolute need, thinking with a united spirit to its future."
A future that requires the intention of Rome" will not only be limited to the current municipal borders but will look more there" not only at the outlook of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of capital but also "considering the role that Rome can and must develop as capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first former President American.
He wrote an American politician who is interested in passing on independently: "Barack Obama will be the second former US President.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, in his decisions, reduced the US economy and tube relations (as he does today by private citizen) with the Islamic enemy."
Attacks against Obama increase as the date of the elections.
Miami's wife wrote on a Web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he thinks he will win the highest rank of the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, they are attacks that don't say much; they are attacks of racial nature and they don't answer the electoral question: Will he be a good president? And there are also polls; they all say that Obama wins and with a good advantage.
There is also in this case someone who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the interiors of the southern United States, wrote an editorial: once in the cabinet to vote we know who will vote for the American patriot.
It is one side of the American mentality that has been covered up to the last.
"Tell them what they want, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether about Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama gets to win, we'll get out of America.
things like that before now, which seems almost certain of the success of the black candidate.
Despite all these reasons, however, the winning weapon for democratics is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: What have been the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent her home to the rear.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to do the will.
Also, Iraq for most has been the weak point of Bush.
Whoever assumes George W's position will have a huge duty to develop.
Use, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in newspapers it's time to cut. Many blame the Internet, "assina" for the paper printed.
Fifty American journalists have been interviewed by PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
Today, though, journalists are almost all pessimists about their future.
However, journalists have not openly expressed less concern about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is an economic model crisis destroyed.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where editors work to carry out the paper are a major problem.
It is a problem to be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as it is understood by the majority of the public is substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the U.S. journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at national level is following a wrong course.
In the local field, the executive group is 65 per cent.
Emission against pressure.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
Most editorial houses open a break on the Internet, for many views as the "assassin" of the paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are opening up technology in the hope "that does something good" by journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is among those who run newspapers – whether the directors – and journalists who work for them.
56 per cent of national executives are sure that their journalists share the same values, while the percentage falls to 23 per cent at local level.
For some this has to do with "work security".
Executives thinking of losing their job in 3 years are 47 per cent at national level.
For the newspaper staff it's 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, etc) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a nation such as the U.S., with 300 million citizens and millions of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become "tomala or leave it".
The directors receive almost always good wages, while the editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, but retirement and social insurance.
For holidays, the reason is complicated: one total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 days in the end after a certain number of years.
But U.S. journalists, by their admission, are "patients" followed during the year.
It's all a climate issue.
UNIPOL: Roman Trial, DANILO COUPOLA BETWEEN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaud, has decided to reject the instance of real estate owner Danilo Coppola who had requested permission to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
It covers this investigation by bankroll in the field of research on the anti-compatibility pact on the Unipol-Bnl scale.
In the course of the arrest process , last week , he obtained domestic release , transforming him into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata .
Her lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate owner be allowed to travel the streets of the province to a capital room.
According to the court, these journeys (for which pm has voted against) would allow you to influence your company and access the evidence that they accuse you.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had been demonstrated a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, more interested in winning Wall Street than saving the economy.
We are confirmed by the New York Times yesterday by informing us that the current crisis is at the hands of the Republican party, which is increasingly divided between its old soul in the East, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, in turn, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, particularly in the states of the Centre and the South.
The soul, in fact, has become preposterous with the vote of who spoke at the beginning.
This is just one example of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not just here.
Both in the United States and in Europe since then, the crisis has seemed to work as a accelerator for incubation phenomena that with the new climate are stabilized and brought to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-update, the extraordinary re-activation, of the double state-government category in relation to a re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is, indeed, a crisis of banking institutions which have strong financial relations with the outside, but above all, the balance of families living in a single country and in a single state is much more committed.
What creates an immediate political problem for those who rule it is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and of those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears globally but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be essentially out of play or do not have much to say: the crucial test is the European Union which is always divided between the different interests and the different state strategies it is not possible to decide any policy in common.
It is from the Government of each State that all expect intervention, rescue and rehabilitation plans, new rules and, above all, fund-raising: from the time it comes to court, only the State has economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy matters.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimization to use them: two incalculable resources, values in certain circumstances in which no market is likely to exist and no organization can ever be available at the same time.
This new emphasis on the state-nation crisis is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance whenever the new development of the economy tends to assign it to a very linked factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of more sophisticated technology, inmaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already intended to dominate the world, we realized that our future would have to change more and more with less material things such as water, crops and oil.
All things that, you know, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth but are also absolutely united in a circular space, a territory.
So he who is a sovereign certainly has many more letters about him who is not, and to him who has the desire to live in a place without crops, oil and water.
I'm going to the second news but I'm having a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leader.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who can handle the situation.
On the other hand, there is a wave of mistrust for existing leadership, of a particular economic nature which is inadequate with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain alarming sense: a mistrust, intolerance, inadequate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire class of Western countries in an increasing number.
It seems to be increasingly advanced, in several areas of the population, the conviction that before its actions are the same as those of the social elite until now, the same way of feeling and being, its culture in the comprehensive exception of the term, having done its own time and being more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a few words, is subterraneanly fed by a fragmented but powerful movement of the leading classes and traditional political structures, which are reflected in an electoral "revelation" or the sudden changes in collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American Congress against Bush (and also the victory of the right in Italy that has something to see).
It is felt that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their journals, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say something, make it increasingly difficult to understand and then to represent, what has been taking place since today are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis is renewing, intensifying and potentially slowing down.
In the face of all this speaking of a "mass rebellion" today, it is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open is certainly not.
The super climb to walk over the walls
Sell the laws of gravity thanks to a super trapping and in the future walking over the walls like the orange man.
This is the goal of several American research centres and a team of four institutions has now approached quite a few.
With an attachment of just 2.5 cm square meters, scientists have been able to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
THE STUDIO – The American magazine Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is an evolution of existing people who use a particular carbon structure called carbon nanotubs.
"The beginning of the capture can be imagined as a series of pipes arranged as a spaghetti pile" explains zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by gecos patterns, recovered by microscopics that can ensure a perfect attachment to the animal.
The tests on different materials, such as glass, teflon and line paper, have shown that the new adaptive is ten times more powerful than the feet of this reptile and at the same time "it is easy to get rid of the walls," explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton Engineering University.
WATER BY PAREDES? -"This material could be useful as a transitional additive" add Liming Dai.
Caps for walking through the walls just like the man spider? Caps? Yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use than the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubs are heat and electricity drivers.
Other applications might have to deal with space engineering.
For the moment, no superheroes.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to the search for a new adhesion.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian students have presented an adhesion made of micro fibers like hair that self-clean themselves of dust during the movement on a surface to maintain a perfect attachment.
Drugs: Never with fruit game
Attention to the game of apples, oranges and manzana.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if they are taken concomitantly with some drugs, their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing, as the case may be, the effectiveness with serious health consequences.
Repeating the risk of fruit juices, it has been discovered that freshly associated with the use of certain medicines by David Bailey, professor of Western Ontario University in London, who has been sending a new alarm from the 236th National Meeting of American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: just a piece of powder, orange and manganese to reduce the absorption of certain drugs, canceling the beneficial effects and risking the health of patients.
The game of pommel was already under the charge because it was held responsible for increasing some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anselytic, antihistamine and neurological levels.
PHARMACACOS A RIESGOS – The same Italian drug agency had reported in a newsletter two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to pay attention to what is being done if a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone is being taken.
NOT only THE POMELO – Experts also believe that orange and manzana are containing substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active principles inhibited by pommel and other games.
This is why Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milan: "These findings are generally pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that may be trying to change their information notes.
That is why we must always read the illustrations of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, don’t let us be impressed, ask the doctor or pharmacist clearly” the expert from the Ansa agency stressed.
The New Economy to Paul Krugman
The noble economic prize has been assigned to American Paul Krugman for his studies, his trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a Keynesian neon who teaches Princeton University and is an editorialist note from the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most critical decisions of Bush administration regarding the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001, attack on Enron, Krugman had planned in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the United States.
A prophecy that is very politic and has been reproducated to the economy for several years, but that has now been made quite clear.
"I am surprised and a little disturbed about how the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has disappeared quickly from the public's attention," Krugman had declared at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a very aggressive, particularly critical speaker against over-liberalism of Bush administration.
Open Office, I am the third edition of the "anti-Micro" package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the suite open source of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work on the part of volunteer developers, whose back is being monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several news: to the welcome screen and to the less large magazine interface, other more consistent ones are added, such as the compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF(Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Attention is also given to many functions with the Office 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint's presentation, useful for example, to send it via email, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphical development module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create "PDF hybrids" documents that combine the typical Adobe format graphics with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
Collaboration is an element that has received various improvements within applications: the calculation sheet can intervene in various users, avoiding conflicts of change, in the drafting of texts, each contributor is given a colour in the comment for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to carry out some of the functions of OpenOffice to the Web (on the cloud, over the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The request may also be sent to the installation cd at home or at work.
And if the free topic can be a win for the dissemination of houses, it is in business that Open Office is testing the suite, trying the great deal, able to count with several projects already done in public administration and schools.
And there is no lack of even the realities that provide an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Print, for Powerpoint presentation; Dbase, as well as for known access is the program that is capable of working on the base date; and finally Draw the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we have reached nearly 3 million 600 billion, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected number can be exceeded.
Kohl also has a positive result is the fourth case of doping
New positive case on the French tour: this is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, Gerolsteiner team, third-class winner and winner of the best climber remerament.
The news is the site of the newspaper L'Aquipé.
Kohl, 26 years old, is the fourth positive runner to the third generation Epo, after the Italians Ricardo Rico and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also from the Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl's blood samples goes between those performed in the last weeks at the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry lab.
If tests confirm that it is positive, Austria will lose its third position on the Tour and anger against the two years of canonization.
Confirming Kohl's positive doping news to the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordy, who has told the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has been placed on the podium at the back of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, offering the best climber.
Immigrant: THE NEW YORK TIMES PREJUDICE, ITALIA IS RACIIST?
It has only recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with hostility.
This is transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? That's what New York Times is asking in a long article which has dedicated to the debate on racism in Italy starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, the original leader of Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a case of ballet.
This is evidence of what New York Times defines as the "paradoja of the North": the northern regions are at the same time those where they are registered "more integration and more work" but also the highest anti-immigrants feeling of the country and the highest support of the North League".
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited periods of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
The new legislation of the Law also opens the gap on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestine peoples is referred to as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The trend is marked by the Pope who by the President of the Republic: "Georgia Napolitan meeting Benedetto XVI at the Congress has asked the State and the Church to work together to combat racism."
Student victims of expensive rental, up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the last survey of Sunia, the union of tenants, renting an individual room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already taken very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study for a large part of young people for the high costs that the family would have to bear – explains the responsibility of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani – in these cities the demand has completely distorted the market at such a point of launching a process of generalised increase to residents."
In most cases rental offers contain a series of violations: free, unregistered type contracts, without limit of canon, under linked rentals.
Extraordinary interventions are needed in order to regulate prices through the revision of tax taxation.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, about 450 euros are served; for an individual room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Black zone) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (Victoria area).
In Florence a bed is costing an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students focus on areas near the University, they serve €250/280 per bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 per individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bolonia) you are asked for about 600 euros for an individual room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per individual room) in areas near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecity).
The economy is only made if the peripheral area is changed: 300 euros per bed and 450 euros per individual room in Prenestina, Centocelle and around.
In Naples for a bed is 300/450 euros, for a room it costs from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas of Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for one bed you serve 250/350 euros, at least 350 per individual.
in smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a higher weight in the city's economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rentals to students and extra-Communitys is more frequent, there is an additional anomaly: a 25/30 per cent increase in the canon for foreign students in Italy.
Goodbye to the old movie Paradise, the cities cancel the historical rooms
Historical cinemas will close by favouring the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic rooms in a blind city is like a face without eyes."
The image offered by Director Giuseppe Tornatore takes a picture of what is happening in the great Italian urban centres as well as in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, which with the birth of the great methians in the perimeter and the resulting disappearance of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the features of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory,"it is like a friend, a friend with whom a part of the place was shared and so much emotion," observes the director of the new Paradise movie, the film that took 20 years ago the first Oscar and the great prize of the jury to Cannes, who counted the poetry of a provincial cinema and nostalgia for how to live the movie that I lost perhaps forever.
The figures given by the Anec, the leading trader association, are clear: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and to pay most of them are the main rooms of major cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 less in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions by the closures are as first, Emilia-Romaña with 82 less cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
It is a demonstration that the person responsible for its disappearance is the adventure of the multiplex, these three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new methic cinemas: 195 screens but in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romania.
"Italian exercise has developed irrationally," observed Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall is closed, not all its speakers are willing to move to the methians.
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the former state debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view that the Government does not respect the existing laws.
To support the sector would be between 16 and 18 million euros a year.’
In the interest of the case of Bolonia, the first Italian city concerned by the closures, decided to repair with the signature of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of which was in Italy to promote and protect the single room either in the historic centre or in the peripheral.
Among the proposed standards are means of tax relief for managers and public benefits in terms of mobility: spectators can enter the restricted area of traffic and have special rates for parking.
"It's an initiative I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by taking other measures.
True, in contrast to the extra power of methians, traditional rooms need to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional film is a subject that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria movie, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the chip that I agreed to perform the "New Paradise movie", which I had thought of for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I move forward to the Rialto or the Quirinale of National Road already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so that I can not see the cartels burned by the dust, I turn to the other side.”
Lace between politics and 'dragheta', has been arrested by the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to unify the municipal elections for those interested in the Piromalli Cosca."
There are serious allegations that the judges of Calabria's Anti-Fraud Directorate gave to the intentionor and vice-president of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the intentionor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafiosic association.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administration, was also arrested, and his grandson lawyer, homonymous of the boss, already convicted of mafia criminal association and paid 10 million euros.
"Avoiding any legal and moral norm," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay consultations with the lawyer Piromelli.
"It would have been allowed to the mafia family – the judges – to officially enter the municipality by facilitating the great possibility of control and command of public administration."
The president of the Calabre regional meeting Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between organized bad life are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than elsewhere, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of 'dragheta', heroes who keep themselves clean'.
The arrests of this morning are added to those of the past July after the police had announced the cut of heads of the Mafia family Piromelli.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, since 1991 and always because of alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been resolved to administer the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torreone, intent on the Udc at the time of the resolution, after the vote in May 2006, had been elected head of a right centre coalition.
I blow up a scandal when the Prefecture orders municipal council resolution.
I call on the Deputy Minister of the Interior who was then Marco Minniti, accusing him of organizing everything on a political issue, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that Piromalli had arrived to request a change in the A3 road project.
Of the environmental interviews made to Dal Torreone, the judges wrote, "the availability of an entrepreneur, a representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, forming the elections of the public administration on the interests of the mafia families".
When the energy is born of the waves, the great ones descend into the stage
It's an out-of-season that occupys more than 70 per cent of the planet's surface and is now being discovered, the world's largest energy companies.
Olas, currents, seas are the new renewable sources on which the great ones view as Chevron.
The potential for energy recovery of sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years and in the 70s together with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of low oil, in 1980, the idea of using marine energy was isolated, but now environmental cases and the new increase in oil prompted the sector.
The London World Energy Council (WEC) estimated for 2007 that 15 per cent of global electricity needs could be covered by plants that exploit the movement of marine waves.
This would be double the current production by nuclear power stations.
And there would be currents and tides.
Gigants at the attack.
The first company to claim marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has signed an agreement to build an implant in North Portugal.
When the intention was announced, a revolutionary step appeared.
Two years of distance on marine energy are always more and more among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – he has declared the voice of a company associated with the U.S. oil tanker in the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal – and is assessing the possibility of cooperation with us."
Cooperation on the subject is about obtaining permission from the US Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a very important sign, if it is considered that the US continues to extract oil in Alaska and President Bush has recently launched a plan to implement new perforations.
In addition to Chevron is New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increased interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are still talking about a technology at the beginning, because marine energy is no doubt having a major environmental impact.
For now, the impacts such as those Portuguese or Scottish are small and do not seem to create major problems in the ecosystem.
To produce long-scale energy, a technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of good united ones among them.
The force of the waves, which moves the good up and down, becomes hydraulic pressure with guns and cylinders inside the same.
The pressure makes a turbine turn into a generator.
The electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type on development routes, expecting only federal approval, part of energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, in turn, is already producing energy for a commercial centre and for a station using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there is tides, rotates the bubbles of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that nourishes the generator.
Verdant has said he has a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say in the Institute for the Development of Electric Energy, is now worth the potential of the seas.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the seas are more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is particularly about the energy of seas such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with other coastal people, have invested $7 million and half a million in 2008 and a 35 million investment is planned for 2009.
