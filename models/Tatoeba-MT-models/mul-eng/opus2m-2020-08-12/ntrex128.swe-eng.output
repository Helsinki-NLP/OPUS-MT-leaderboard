AM in Wales is worried about "exact like a puckon"
Some AM members of the Wales National Assembly are confused about a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of Wales).
The proposal will be based on plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
AM over the entire political spectrum is concerned about being handy.
An AM for Labor said his group was worried 'cause it's "removing with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who cannot Welsh: Twp means dumb on Welsh and pwp means bad.
An AM for Plaid said that the group in general was "missing" and has proposed other options.
A conservative Welsher said his group is "open" for the name, but noted that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context W is expressed in Welsh equivalent letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which currently compiles legislation for the name, said: "The final decision for which members of the congregation are to be called is so clear to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which had strong support to call the Wales Parliament.
As regards the title for AM, the Commission proposed Welsh Parliament Members (members of Wales) or WMP, but MWP received most support in a public consultation.
AM clearly proposes other options, but the problem of reaching consensus may be the problem of Presidenting Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft legislative amendment within a few weeks.
The amendment legislation also includes other amendments to the way the assembly works, including rules for the disqualification of an AM and the design of the Committee system.
AM shall vote on what they shall be called when they debate the law.
Macedonia implements a referendum on the change in the name of the country
On Sunday, the voters shall vote in favour of the change in the name of the country to the "North-Macedonian Republic".
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute which has taken place over several years with Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
The Act has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, is opposed to the referendum on the change of name and has said he will withdraw from the outcome.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name exchange is the price they have to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's silence when the churches in Harlem support problems
"The older people I talk to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"There's neither here nor now."
He said it's understandable that the bars are gone.
"People are being turned around in other ways now," he said.
"Just isn't like the area's living room anymore, your people go on a regular basis."
The current churches are concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders wait and that "more or later they will get on the road again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments filled with people who do not help the remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people buying apartments in buildings will be white," he said. "This will lead to the closure of all churches, as those who move into apartments will probably not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community 1870, a decade later by St. Martin.
The original white methodist assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a bookstore of shops on 125th Street, a shopping mall in Harlem, who refused to hire or transport black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson's collection planned the renovation, they also built the clock.
Pastor David Johnson, father of Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, called the famous music game "the poor watch".
The expert who played the watch game in July had another name for it: "A cultural tax" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first watch game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said he didn't replace St. Martin's.
The events of the last few months at St. Martin's is a complicated story with architects and entrepreneurs – some associated with the church’s playmanship, others from the Episcopal Foundation.
The Churchman – the governing body of the congregation consisting of the members – wrote to the Constitution in July and expressed concern that the Constitution would "try to transfer the cost" to the Church Father, although the Church Father had not been involved in the formation of alleged architects and businessmen.
Some members of the assembly complained about a lack of transparency from the statute.
Haj damages 13-year-olds who dive for eggs in California
On Saturday, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark who died after dogs in California on the first day of the summer season, according to officials.
The attack took place right before 7:00 in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been blind with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help and walked there with a group of others to get him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was only happy to have found a whore, but then he noticed that the boy shouted, "I've become a bitch!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that all the keys had been removed.
"I called everyone to get out of the water. "It's a haj in the water!" Hammel told me.
The boy fled to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is said to be critical.
Of course it was.
The bathroom guard Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim had traumatized his upper chest.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours by investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 hazards in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's entry into the British beauty market
Sainsbury's takes an An Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with similar beauty features with beauty specialists.
As part of a considerable push into the British beauty market at £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the decline in the fashion and household market, the larger beauty gains will be tested in 11 shops across the country and implemented in more shops next year if they are successful.
Investment in the beauty market is part of the rapid purchase's attempt to fill the pillars previously taken up by TV devices, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said they are thinking of double their beauty offer to up to 3,000 products, including the brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Available offers from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with marked areas, such as in shops like Boots.
The store chain also launchs its boutique brands so that most of the products are vegan – which is increasingly required by young customers.
In addition, the perfume seller Fragrance Shop will test the status of two Sainsbury's shops – the first stand opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second opening in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend to buy less food every day in local shops means that fast shopping has to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, VD for Sainsbury's, has said that their shops will always appear cautious in an attempt to fight cheap shops like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos status in hundreds of shops and has also acquired a number of Habitat status since they bought both chains two years ago, which they believe has increased the sale of food and made the acquisition more profitable.
The previous attempt to give the beauty and apothecary sections a face surface failed.
Sainsbury's test of cooperation with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the cooperation was closed after a discussion on how the revenue from Boats' sales would be distributed in the fast purchase.
The new strategy will follow that Sainsbury sold its apothecary business with 281 shops to Celesio, owned by the chain Lloyd's Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
They claim Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an increased supply of luxury leather products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichi, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Sanisbury's business, said: "We have given our beauty treasures a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in highly trained staff who can advise customers.
Our brand offer has been designed to meet all needs, and with an adequate environment in humble places, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way to shop."
Peter Jones "resanding" after Holly Willoughby pulls off his share of £11 million
Dragons Den-Star Peter Jones is "facing" because TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulls out a share of £11 million with his life-style mark to focus on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't stop with their brand Truly, with holiday clothes and accessories.
Their activity has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This morning's representative, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons De Star Peter Jones angry by withdrawing from their luxurious life-style brands in the last minute – to focus on their new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became "resanding" at a exciting meeting at his high-ranking business quarter in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite offered her new contract – worth £1.5 million – which means she no longer focused on their brand Truly, with holiday clothes and accessories.
The activity has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and double Willoughbys estimated worth of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she was leaving Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly was clearly Holly's primary priority.
It would be her long-term future for the coming years.
Her decision to get out of shock all those involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods that are ready to be sold at Marlow's Highway."
Experts believe that this morning's decision to withdraw may cost the company several million because of considerable investments in all of the goods and light to clothing and the risk of further delays in the launch.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Mr. Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Cap 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as president in March.
The couple are having lunch together with Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to be a mark agent for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as "I'm a Celebrity" on TV.
A source near Jones said last night: "We don't comment on his business."
Tufft talk "and then we became loved"
He mocked that the media would criticise him for a comment that some would consider to be "valueless a president" and that he was so positive about North Korea's leadership.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "newsan carrot":
"I haven't given up anything."
He said Kim wanted another meeting after Trump missed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a great step for North Korea's nuclear weapons equipment.
However, the negotiations on nuclear weapons equipment have been finalized.
More than three months after the Singapore meeting in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "comparable response" from the United States after the first phase of North Korea.
He noted that the United States continues sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his supporters.
"It's going well with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a sovereign relationship."
He said his attempt to improve Kim's relationship has had positive results – a stop to rocket tests, the release of hostages and the remnants of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It is so easy to pray as a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this packed arena we would have about 200 people here," Trump said and pointed to the public before him.
Tsunami and earthquake damages islands in Indonesia, hundreds of deaths
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were promised that they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lomboks had lost their homes, there was no exception, which was required for international aid.
"In many cases they have unfortunately been very clear that they do not ask for international help, which makes it all complicated," said Ms. Sumbung.
Save the children will gather a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear if foreign personnel can work there.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the Natural Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to decide whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the relief work.
In view of Indonesia's ongoing earthquake, the country is still undeterred in the heat of nature.
There's been a tsunami disaster in Aceh, but they're rare on other coastal lines.
The absence of a Tsunami protection acid in Palu, although a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship that has attached itself to Lombok to deal with earthquakes is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the promise to improve Indonesia's narrow infrastructure in its election campaign and have spent large sums on roads and trains.
However, the lack of co-financing has caused Mr. Jokos' administration to fall before the next year's elections.
Mr. Joko was also impressed by the quadrupling sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machetes, pill boats, and other primary weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge invited in the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a target in 89 minutes in Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's target when his bed was down with 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and jumped a stick against the outside column.
The attempt went high over the target area towards the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell over Kepa Arizabalaga's jump and landed in the net.
"I was just trying to get into a position to get to the ball and players that Shaq always plays forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and didn't think so much about it but just jumped."
Chelsea led with 1-0 after the first half of the month after a goal in 25 minutes from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striper held a passport back to Matthew Kovacic, pushed from the middle of the field and printed it on Liverpool's page.
Kovacic did a quick give-and-go at the middle.
Then he got a superhero that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard jumped from the defense and got the ball in the net at the left column with a left-photoed park across Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool is fighting Napoli at the Championships League in Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 a.m. on Wednesday.
Chelsea is hosted to Videoton in Uefa Europe League in London at 15:00 a.m. on Thursday.
Death figures for Tsunami in Indonesia increase to 832
The number of deaths for earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has increased to 832, according to the country's disaster agency earlier today.
Many people were reported to have stuck in the holes of buildings planted in the earthquake at 7.5 which hit on Friday and blew up to six metres, said the Agency’s spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was filled with bridges from buildings like roots.
The police arrest you, 32, suspected of murder after the woman's mind is broken
A murder has begun after a woman's equal was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44th year was found at 7:55 p.m. on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man is arrested for murder.
The police have invited people in the area who have seen or heard anything to do.
Criminal Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in an early stage of the investigation, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a camera to contact us because they can have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who was found living in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, friends who believe that they know the woman are on their way to the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is taking place and the police are informing the victim's closest members.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one can come in or get out of the building.
He became unhappy when he got to know what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it will take several hours before they can come in again.
A police assistant told a man that the whole area was treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman came up on the spot.
She says "it's so stupid" about and about again.
At 14:00 a.m., there were two police cars in front of the bus and another just outside.
A number of police assistants were in front of the dispute with a view to building the apartment.
People with information are asked to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's status of Cromwell's most recent sacrifice for greens on rewriting history
A banner was poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society called Mr Cricks' proposal for "record" and "try to write about history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the state of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be brought into the current debate on the removal of states."
The icon class during the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
False Cromwell might have been sacrificed for what his father Thomas did 100 years ago.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the views of the 1800s on whether and is part of the history of a man who many still consider should be dismissed.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more at the end of the 1800s than now, consider Cromwell to have defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a proper representation, it is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has no doubt affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His companies as Lord Protector also deserve to be stopped and fired.
Murderers Kill Bonds
A bond was attacked and killed by a grey on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, who was only identified with his last name Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a street on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A Grisupfactor is prepared to inject the vaccine into pigs in a pigsty on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He is reported to have completed his cousin from Yunnan County on Wednesday to sell 15 greys on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby pigeon was open.
He said there was a big pigeon in the pigeon with blood on his mouth.
A legal investigation confirmed that the 250 kilograms of grain had killed the bond, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and confused," said the cousin who was identified with the last name Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to eat his vegetables at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The crisis that killed the band didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the crisis had been locked in to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence at the site.
Yuan's family and market officials are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It's rare to be attacked by attackers, but it's happened before.
In 2016 a grey hit a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and gave the man serious damage.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - pound [300 kg] drought hit a fence in Wales against a tractor until his wife threatened it.
When a band in Oregon was set up by its 2012 Griessers, a band in Manitoba told CBC News that cracks are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can work as a "catalysator".
"They're just toys.
They're nervous and they're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The rest of the Rosa Orcan for a vast amount of heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As expected, the Orcano Rosa becomes weaker when it is transported across the shallow water at the north coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring an overwhelming rain to North and South America in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind power up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five EST on Sunday and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
In time, a tree begins to be formed across the Pacific Sea and traveled east toward the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches half of Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will take up to 25 cm rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching river will create a massively strong rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 cm rain will cause dangerous floods, floods and possible earthquakes in the forest.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5–7.5 cm rain per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm rain is expected in some places in the western United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Emergency overexploitation is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the expanded tropical account.
It is not absolutely recommended that no one be thrown into the forest when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can cause cannons to melting rivers and storms leading to strong local winds that blow around the sand.
The approaching trail is certainly a local strong rain for parts of the southern California coastal line.
It is possible with combined over a cm of rain, which can lead to the flow of tides and to take its way.
It would be the first account in the area during the accounting period.
Some skimmed tropical billboards will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the account becomes much more extensive later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue during Wednesday.
October can result in intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when Arctic cools down but tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes in short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in Central America on Sunday.
It is almost ten degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will be again distributed.
Large parts of central and eastern America are expected to get a hot start on October with about 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of North-East America.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows a high chance of warmer temperatures than the average in Eastern America during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people were looking at Brett Kavanaugh's assets.
Over 20 million people were looking at the catchment of the day from Brett Kavanaugh, who was named to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse that was due to take place in the 1980s, on six TV networks.
In time, the political death and normal delivery were interrupted for the last minute of the Friday – Arizona Senator Jeff Flakes's deal with the FBI, where they were given a week to investigate the complaint.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh took her when he was full and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate witness and said he was absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of spectators on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million declared by Nielsen.
They calculated average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other TV networks that showed the missing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people who look from the office.
Similarly, there are as many spectators as for a football match in the final game or Oscarsgalan.
Fox News Channel, whose representatives have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had most of the audience with an average of 5.69 million during the long run, according to Nielsen.
ABC had most of the 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was focusing on the Friday drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh filmed CNN and CBS demonstrators who shouted at him when he tried to take a seat at a hearing with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the demonstrators screamed at him, which was shown in direct transmission of CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth about the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Fleke said his office had issued a statement and before closing the doors he said he would have more to say after hearing the committee.
The TV network sent live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted on whether they would proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the whole Senate.
But Flake said he was only going to do it if the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominated over the coming week, which the minority Democrats have been working on.
Fleke was partly convinced by his friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flexibility's decision had a major impact, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political players" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political players" on the future of the United Kingdom and undermine the interest of the nation in an interview with Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will host the Conservative Meeting in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another round of her interview on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal for the United Kingdom and the EU to collect customs duties was "completely unfair".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: The police arrest suspect Dytheon Simpson for the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the murder shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dytheon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and put in the murder shelter, said the police in Baton Rouge.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
The police found the glass bags on the spot and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After a meeting with Simpson, the police said he admitted he shot Wade.
His town was set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The judge in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, which said the cause of death was a year of shock in his head and neck.
The police thank Louisana State Police for their space intervention, the police's state legal base, the Southern University police and the residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "fly and the pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 meters long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played the bass for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's bass trainer Will Wade said the ship was "crossed" and "chocked" by Wayne's death.
"You're worried about this all the time," said Wade.
Volcano asks for ships over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatépetl has reached the southern part of Mexico City.
National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity had been detected in the crater and the recorded 183 emissions of gas and gas during the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered several women and shoes.
Images on social media showed tons of steel layers on windscreens in the areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noted increased activity in the volcano, which stands 72 km south of the capital since a earthquake at 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police kill with Catalan separatists before the annual vote
Six persons are arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after they met with the police at the same time as thousands of people took part in rivaling demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catholic polarisation vote on section.
A group of masked separatists held back by the police threw eggs and colorful powders on them, leading to dark dummymmols on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Murders broke out even later in the day, and police used their guns to stop them.
For several hours, self-determination groups called "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists called "long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor damage caused by the protests, according to local pressure.
The vote is still tense in the region which lasts for a year after the referendum, the first October that was considered illegal by Madrid but was rejected by Catalan separatists.
A overwhelming majority voted for independence, but the participation was low when most who were against the session voted in favour of the vote.
According to the Catholic authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent co-operations in hell when the police tried to stop the vote at resorts in the region.
Self-determination groups campaigned during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but another route was forced.
Electrician Narcis Termes, 68, participated in the separatist protests with his wife and said he no longer believed that Catalonia would become independent.
"In hell we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal gain in regional elections in December, Catalan parties that are for themselves have found it difficult to keep the driving force up this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-contained exil or sit in line for their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who played the protest in support of the police on his mobile phone, said the conflict had been triggered by policies on both sides.
"It's always going to be exciting," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders who has been sitting in the hall since the end of last year, announced that he is going to apply for election to the European Parliament next year.
"Candidacy with the European Parliament is the best way to judge the return of democratic values and the subquota we have experienced from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into the house
Three men – 33, 34 and 39 – have been arrested after driving a car into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Criminal Inspector Bob Blemmings said the bricks and the building itself were damaged.
An armchair may also have been fired against the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Mengas's first goal for Livingston's secure profit
Livingston shocked Rangers and judged Steven Gerard to his second loss of 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas strike proved to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was split into two with Hibernia.
Gerard's page has not yet won a prize in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Before this, Ranger's Rapid Vienna welcomes the European League on Thursday.
Livingston extends its profit rate to six matches – Chief Trainer Holt has not yet experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livington misses opportunities for two visitors
Holt's law should have taken the lead long before they achieved their objectives; their justice gave Rangers all possible problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but let down his performance across the target, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot the board after moving in to measure Craig Halkett's nickname across the target.
The House was pleased to let Rangers play before them when they knew they could attack in certain games.
And that was how the decisive goal was made.
Rangers gave up a free park and Livingston used an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a chance, which made goals from the middle of the target area.
In that situation Ranger had dominated the ball, but the defence of the home was uninterrupted and the target guard Liam Kelly was left in great peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was rejected by Ranger's target guard Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot board from another of Livington's fixed games.
Crossings were constantly entering Livington's target area and were handled without problems. Two penalty requirements – after Halkett’s challenge by the exchanger Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were removed.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal appearance and results for Livingston.
Each one was unique and continues to exceed the expectations on the way up.
Their play-style and staff have only been changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves honor for having galvanized the layer since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a well-organised defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on a hospital basis.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their hours under Gerard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball didn't have to – they just opened the house-to-house once – and it's something of a watch for Rangers, who's in the middle.
Erdogan gets a mixed welcome in Koln
The Saturday was invited to the west and blue sky (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – which will repair the relationship between NATO allies.
They have become obsessed with human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25,000 spectators from being gathered outside Moscow for security reasons, but many of the supporters were gathered near to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurdish – also heard their voices and condemned both Erdogan's police and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The dueling protests show the split views of a visitor who is considered to be a hero of some German Turks and are condemned as a tyrant of others.
Weighing in Deptford: Cyclist dies in a truck
A cyclist died in a truck in London.
Crocken owned rooms near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-traced road in Deptford in southeastern London, about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stood in the car and the hospital was called there, but the man died on the spot.
Crocken owns a few months after another cyclist died in an explosion on Children's Street, about 1.5 km from the crocken on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Walls have been stopped and buses have been redirected and car drivers are forced to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in tuult
Six prison guards have been injured in anxiety at a high-security prison for men, according to Prison Office.
The anxiety broke out on HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and is still going on.
Specialized "tornadoves" have been called there to deal with concerns involving eight prisoners on a flight.
The guards were treated in a place of pain in the face.
A speaker for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been sent here to handle the current incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those behind this will be referred to the police and may receive increased prison sentences."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director was treated at hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October in hell, the police were called to prison to deal with serious concerns where staff were attacked with billiard balls.
The Rosa Orcan threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dark areas can benefit)
It is rare to experience tropical low pressure when Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen in the beginning of next week when the remaining energy of Rosa is rising above the forest in the southwestern United States, with a risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden floods for Mondays and Tuesdays in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain later on Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "two tropical cyclones have maintained their status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an Orcan within 65 km from Arizona's border."
National Hurrine Centers latest models predict 5-10 cm rain, with isolated quantities up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
Other parts of the forest in the southwestern United States, including central cliffs and Great Basin, are likely to be 2.5-5 cm rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas where there is no risk of sudden floods, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Overwhelming is very serious, but some of the account will probably be useful because Southwestern America suffers from drought.
According to U.S. Draught Monitor, over 40 percent of Arizona's extreme dry, the next highest category, reported weather.com.
The Rosa Orcan will first be transported over half of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, still equipped with power in the morning with maximum wind power of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north of 20 km/h.
The storm is crashing on the shallow waters of the Pacific Sea, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico's land mass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Some parts of Mexico can be very rainy, which poses a considerable risk of overexploitation.
"A total of 7,5-15 cm rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach the Arizona border earlier Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then be carried through Arizona and into South Utah late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is a very strong rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the forests in the southwestern United States," said the National Hurrine Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-sustaining sudden floods and floods in the forest, as well as earthquakes in mountain terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three boys in the teenage years and a 20-year-old have been suspected of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with a knife year in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the apartment is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old, and a 20-year-old, arrested during the night in Radstock area, said the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who can have filmed what happened with the cell phone to appear.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "lead, elekheten, Illiscan" from the Democratic Party
"A vote for judges Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the lack of respect for the democratic party and scandalous tactics," Trump told his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "lidite of elakhet, illusk" from the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the convention on Thursday and rejected Christine Blasey Ford’s firm and unsensibly accusation that he had been sexually involved with her several years earlier when they were teenagers.
Because he also witnessed before the Congress on his charges.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliantness and quality and courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most competent legal minds of our time, a jurist with a first-class history of serving the public," he told his supporters in the public in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the vote of the Republicans in the coming mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of our most important choices in life.
I don't apply, but I do," he said.
"That's why I'm going around and fighting for sovereign candidates."
Trump claimed that the democracies are trying to "stand up and stop".
The first decisive vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number increases
At least 384 people died, many were displaced when giant waves broke against the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities of Saturday.
Hundreds of people had been gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu on Friday when up to six meters high waves broke against the beach in the sky and pushed many to a safe death and destroyed everything in its path.
Tsunami came after an earthquake at 7.5.
"When the tsunami hit yesterday people stood on the beach instead of running immediately from there, and they fell victims of tsunamis," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency BNPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Tsunami was not alone but left with cars, stocks and houses. It killed everything in its way," he said. He also said that Tsunami had been transported on the open sea up to 800 km/h before the coastal line.
Some fell into wood to get rid of Tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
The flight photo released by the disaster agency shows that many buildings and shops are destroyed, brothers are confused and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
The aftershock still killed the coastal town on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology BPPT stated in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake on Friday was 200 times as large as the nuclear bombs released on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long, small bay, which may have made tsunami larger, according to the Agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as "absolute" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found under the bridge of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and damages could be even worse along the coastal line 300 km north of Palu, a region called Doghea, which is near the epicenters of the earthquake.
The communication from Doghea "was completely lost without any information," said Nugroho.
"There are over 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can be much worse," they said.
The Agency was criticised on Saturday because it had not been informed that Tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said the guards had drowned within the time the warning was issued.
In a amateur video shared on social media, a man is listening to surveillance in a built-in freaky warning about tsunamis for people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water falls against the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a massive power breakdown that interrupted all communication around Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to carry out their rescue work.
The military has started sending your cargo flights from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated persons are still in great need of food and other needs.
The city airport has been opened for the relief work and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunamis in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Workers from World Vision in Dothraa have gone to Palu, where they are looking for protection in the garden outside the office, but they saw destruction along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have initiated the ongoing assistance work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad may be used only if exemption is granted after a disaster.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a speaker for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say it's a national disaster, we can send international aid, but that status has not yet been clarified."
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake of Friday and tsunamis, families and friends of missing persons were still hoping that their close and dear ones would prove to be the miracles that light the dark natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was saved from a clock.
On Sunday the rescue workers saved a woman who had been stuck under a bridge for two days with her mother's body.
Gendon Subbandono, trainer of Indonesia's national flight type, had trained two of the missing screen flights for Asian games, which were completed in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandigi, were his students.
"As the screen flyer, I have my own unsatisfied burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that hours after the screeners heard that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he sent the news of WhatsApp to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
But his message just got a gray book instead of two blues.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Double takes $26,750 during bank-matching at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning's salary was $26,750 from a Brink's employee who filled a banknote at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The car driver had emptied a banknote in the maintenance facility and would deliver more money, said criminal Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was arrested, "push another man behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that would be delivered.
The Witnesses saw several suspicious planes from the area, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
All who have information on the identity of the perpetrators should contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes its name – to Yes.
He reported on Twitter on Saturday and said, "The event that is officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as title for its eighth album, which was released in June.
The name exchange comes before his work on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande in the program, who introduced "sensitive reasons" according to the program's creator.
Ye is abbreviation of the current professional name of West, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio value.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only', to only Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a row known rapper who's changed his name.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, previously co-operated with the West, has previously written his name with and without links and deals.
Mexico AMLO is forced not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to use the military against civilians now that the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody confrontation with students.
Lopez Obrador promised Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that "never use the military to force the Mexican people".
The troops fired their weapons against a peaceful demonstration on the street on the second October 1968 and killed up to 600 people during a left-wing student movement in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans with monthly contributions to students and by opening up more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and poor educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
US should double AI funding
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on field research, according to the finder and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment will be made after several parts of the U.S. government have made the statement on AI, although the United States does not have an overall AI strategy.
China presented its plan in line with the objective of becoming leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next break in AI," said Lee.
A double so large budget can double the chance of the next major AI traffic in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier in the month of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is a VD for Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies – Face+.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the most ranked American Othello player, and later put him in charge of Microsoft Research and was VD for Google's China department.
Lee mentioned earlier technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as Robot Challenge from Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what would happen next in order to identify future spectators.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government estimates, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technical companies have employed leading persons from the university to work on AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the United States with AI innovation.
"I think the green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in the AI," he said.
State Council in China issued its development plan for the next generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, National Natural Science Foundation provides an estimate of people at academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations spend money on researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation which would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not made any progress over several months.
Macedonian People's Voice on Named Change
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed to "North-Macedonian Republic", which would solve a number of years of old dispute with Greece which has prevented its attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its neighbours in the north constitutes a requirement in its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the name exchange would undermine the identity of the Macedonian slave majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he does not want to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubts whether the 50 per cent minimum participation required to be considered valid will be achieved.
The question of the vote in the referendum is: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
However, the candidate for the change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claims that it is worth changing the name so that Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia was split, can join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live free under the European Union's umbrella, for this means more secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not binding, but enough with Members of Parliament have said that they intend to follow the outcome in order to be considered decisive.
The name change requires a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
According to the National Electoral Commission, no irregularities were reported at 13.
But participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children's debt, we are home in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the Macedonian referendum on the country's name, which would open the way for membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a small scene and set up chairs in front of the hall set up by those who book the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our head in the air, not slip through the back door," Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't welcome us as Macedonia we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, a NATO member would lead to well-needed investments in Macedonia, which has more than 20% unemployment.
"I think the absolute majority will vote yes, for over 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said when he voted.
He said a "Yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future."
According to a study published in Monday by the Macedonian Police Research Institute, between 30 and 43% of voters voted in the referendum, which is due to the minimum participation required.
According to another study conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 per cent of the participants wanted to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them wanted to vote.
In order to calculate the vote, 50 per cent of registered voters will have to vote plus one vote.
If the vote fails, the first serious backlog of the Western-oriented government's policy will be taken over in May.
Look at: Manchester City Sergio Aguero takes over all Brighton's defense to achieve goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won Brighton's prize in Manchester City on 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero got it to look ridiculously simple when he set his target at the 65th minute.
The Argentinian striker got a pass from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He jumped between the three Brighton's defenses and came out on the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green trees.
He took around a champion and jumped from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he put an adjustment to Sterling to the left.
The English front used its first range in the target area to return the ball to Aguero, which used the right foot to beat Brighton's target guard Matthew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has a problem with his feet," said city manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about he'd play for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were sure he was doing his goal right now."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial takeover in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside the Brighton revision of that game.
He sent a nice park along the left side of Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of shots and led Sterling to the outer column.
Sky Blues forward jumped the ball into the net right before it got out of stock.

Scherzer wants to play with Rockies
Nationals have been removed from the final game, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But the competition focused Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only about Rockies, which is a match before Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still has a chance to finish the game.
Rockies got a wild card place with a win of 5-2 over Nationals on Friday night, but is still out after his first division title.
"We play nothing, but we can have a chance to swallow gum in knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the public and that the second layer would play at a higher level than any other layer I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals have not yet announced their launch for Sunday, but according to reports, they are fighting to let Scherzer fall under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would start his 34th, warm up in the bubble pen on Thursday and throw on his normal holiday day.

Trump keeps numbers in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the Supreme Court, when he spoke of the importance of the vote of the Republicans in the coming mid-term elections.
"All we've done is stand at the game in November.
We're five weeks from one of our most important choices in life.
This is one of the great, great... I don't apply, but I do. That's why I'm going around and fighting for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a family, a group of radical Democrats, you see this happening here and now.
They are determined to take back the power whatever is required, you see their folly, homelessness.
They wonder who they have to hurt, who they have to drive over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We're not going to let them get it."
Democrats, he said, are fighting to "stand up and stop".
"You've seen it in the last four days," he said and called the democracies "arga and elegance and homeish and false".
He mentioned the democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who is sitting in the Senate Judicial Committee, which is dominated by a high-ranking wave from the scenes.
"Do you remember what she said?
'Did you close the document?'
'Eh, uh, huh?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for a... 'It was really bad body language, one of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labor is no longer a broad church.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was almost surprised.
I am, however, all the latest in a series of MPs from Labor who can hear that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she was faced with anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not staying with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe – ironically enough similar substances that Jeremy criticised earlier leaders for.
In the Communication on the Meeting with Nottingham East Labor on Friday it was "we want the meetings to be welcome and productive".
During most of my eight years as the Local MP Labours, the GC meetings on Fridays have been exactly that.
But unfortunately, many meetings are not that, and the promise of "friendly, smarter" policy has been forgotten long ago, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly evident that divergent views are not tolerated within the Labour Union, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party's leaders accept them.
This began immediately after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I once thought had a similar political view I expected to make a whole revolution and take positions that I would never have taken – whether it was the security of the nation or the internal market of the EU.
Every time I speak publicly – and it really doesn’t matter what I say – follows a quote from above on social media that requires me to be rejected, criticises my policy and says I shouldn’t even be in Labor.
And this doesn't just kill me.
In fact, I have more luck than some of my fellow Members because the comments that are addressed to me most of the time are political.
I admire the professionality and determination of these colleagues when they are exposed to a stream of seismic and racist abuses every day but never give up.
One of the biggest shortcomings in your policy is the level of abuses that are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labor should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in fact, we are no longer this broad church and with every misgiving and change in the electoral rules, the party is becoming more and more sneer.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too straight, so it's "ordinarily arranged".
But that's not why I became politicians.
Even after I went to Labour as a school student 32 years ago, caused by the summary of Thatcher's government that literally got my primary school classroom to fall together, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at local level and as government ministers.
I have never completely understood my political views, and that includes the latest choice.
No one in Nottingham East can somehow have been confused about my views on the police and the subjects I do not hold with the current leadership.
To you as the promoter of the campaign on Friday, I just want to say that when the country goes against a Brexit that will damage households, activities and public services I don't understand why anyone would want to waste my time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party.
But my first message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituent – both labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threat of rejection or political satisfaction will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Oslagna Air on top
Two attempts in the last minute may have gained a reputation, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved triumph in this beautiful Tennt's Premiership match.
They're now at the top, the only unscathed side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, which gave the homematch victory, and coach Peter Murchie has all the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested during our matches so far and are still unbeatable, so we are so clearly happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than us."
Grant Anderson's effort at the 14th minute, which was converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a gold card for Captain Rory Hughes of Scotland, who was released by Warriors for the match, let Melrose let the figures speak and Jason Baggot did an unconverted attempt.
Climo increased Ayrs' leadership with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he made points and converted a solo attempt to give Ayre a 17-5 lead during the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the leadership to five points.
It was then a long wait after a serious injury to Ruarhyh Knott, which was due to the plan, and after the reopening Air led again with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, who was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting Captain Blair MacPherson then got a gold card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of hard pressure.
But the house painting recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a gold card for having thanked Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the punishment line-out behind the Air's furniture.
Climo converted, which he did almost immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent away the banker Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home plan.

Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter the restaurant after it has been found to have been designated as a VD for a licensed restaurant activity.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays together with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
Duon has announced that the next nine months will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to plan for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is a VD for AOD Morn Limited.
The chess player refused to comment, but a source at Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan would join Glasgow's "florning restaurant industry".
"The Sea belongs to us": Coastless Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to Stilla Sea again
The seamen patrol a well-covered high-rise for the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
The base of the fleet from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to restore it."
In coastless Bolivia, the memory of the coastal line lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of the 1800s is still strong – and it is also long after sailing back to the Pacific Sea.
This hope is higher than over several years now that Bolivia is awaiting a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1st, following five years' consideration.
"Bolivia has the operation, a harmony of unity and peace, and expects so clearly the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will judge for the benefit of Bolivia's demands that Chile, after years of informal discussions, must negotiate with Bolivia to allow them to withdraw themselves into the sea.
The decision of the Monday is also of great importance to Evo Morales, the charismatic-born President of Bolivia who is facing a controversial struggle for change next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Sea," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is impossible for the Court to judge Bolivia's benefit, and that it would not be much changed even if it did.
The Court of Justice of the United Nations, based in the Netherlands, has no right to assign Chilean territory and has provided that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is notified only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert at international law.
And the last four years may have been more damaging than promoting Bolivia's chances.
"The question of sea access has been covered by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She claims that Morales' aggressive rhetoric has grown on Chile's permanent well-being.
Bolivia and Chile will gradually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after this.
The two countries have not exchanged Ambassadors since 1962.
Before this, President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in Haag, did not consider that the Court’s decision had been taken very quickly.
The Monday will give Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new era for the relationship with Chile" and a chance to "stop for 139 years of mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – used the sea as a political crisis.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Sea," he said.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we must move forward from the past."
North Korea says nuclear equipment requires trust in the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that the nation will not undermine its nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfil the commitments made at a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be on the border to resolve the death of nuclear weapons diplomat more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "willing dream" to continue sanctions and US protests against a statement that the end of the Korean War will never cover North Korea.
Washington hesitates to join the conference without Pyongyang first launching significant nuclear weapons equipment.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want one for the summit.
But there is widespread scepticism against Pyongyang really trying to get rid of a arms race that the country probably sees as its only chance of guaranteeing its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for other summits between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion show reveals last line huge main subscribers on the way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hate collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing to do for you.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed an offer of modest, oversized headbones for their SS19 collection on catwalken, which mixed the styles on Paris fashionweek.
Amazingly attractive hats have taken over Instagram these summers, and the designers have sent their amazing creatures to catwalken.
Valentino’s first creation was an overcrowded beige with a birdlike wide hat that completely took over the head of the models.
Other over-dimensional accessories included yellowed watermelons, a trollach hat and even ananas – but they are not intended to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a choice of brave masks, in low time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had combined lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute Couture.
One creation looked like a wet cloth with a snorkel and a thick mask, and another looked like a soft glass.
And if you're going on that huge courage, you're lucky.
Modeexperts predict that the huge hats can be on their way to shops near you.
The oversized hats will be immediately after La Bomba – the half hat with a table of 60 cm which has been placed on all of Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural mark that lay behind the incredible attractive hat that has taken over social media sent out another great creature on the catwalk – a half-fish which was almost as large as the model in the bathroom that it contained.
The refinery in the terracotta, with Raffia and a white leather handle, was outstanding in Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris fashionvecka.
The newslist Luke Armitage said to the FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach pools in the shops next summer – the designer has had such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with yet another set of outstanding test results, which is only enhanced by individual and collective progress in sports, art, music and other social engagements.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are pursuing the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As a education sector that can design and implement custom learning plans, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and asked subjects at schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot just trust English when we create relationships and trust people from other countries.
This year's test results show that languages are at the top of the list, with maximum approved results in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final Higher Grade.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 per cent of students who studied mandarin received an A in High Grade, and 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as decisive skills such as children and young people without any doubt will need in the future.
Languages that are now considered to be as important as natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics at educational levels in independent schools and abroad.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission 2014 found that employers for various reasons had difficulty in carrying out their free services, with 17 per cent attributed to a lack of language skills.
With this in mind, language skills become increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills become necessary in a globalised world.
Despite the choice of careers, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted another language.
To communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person automatically provides a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 British adults published by YouGov 2013, 75 per cent replied that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that came up in a two-digit percentage (15 per cent).
That is why it is so important to invest in language skills for our children.
Speaking several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland each school will learn different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while another will teach in languages that are considered the most important for Britain before 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose between free schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish self-employed schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and get them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, there is no doubt that language continues to be crucial to the country's future, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication capacity".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's youth.
You have to do it.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakers Debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who look forward to seeing LeBron James do a debate for Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker's coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play on Sunday's first season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's playing has not yet been determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Laker's official website.
Laker's reports Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' seasoning scheme.
"I don't need seasoning at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Trump West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump takes his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned events in the next week, including events in places where he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Waiting for a confirmatory vote of its candidate to the post of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for future mid-year elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of the Congress before the current elections in November.
What time is Trumps West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump Wheeling, West Virginia campaign event is scheduled to 19:00, Saturday evening, 29 September 2018.
You can look at Trumps West Virginia-rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to take off this week's candidates to the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who were motivated by complaints of his sexual abuse, with a expected delay of the vote from the Senate to a week while the FBI's investigation of the case is under way.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their feet before the November elections.
Thus President Trump said that these five meetings in the next week aim at "encouraging volunteers and contributors when the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of the Congress is so important for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the Hectic campaign period," said a speaker for the Trump campaign who would not be named Reuters.
The night's event, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time during the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent units in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been following in the opinion studies.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come here to try to give him an increase in his opinion studies," says Simon Haeder, a state scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is fighting to keep the hopes alive in front of Sunday's singles
After three unilateral sessions, the parties could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup on Saturday afternoon.
The changing pen of the moment is a completely discovered sport concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before in front of such competitions.
So what moment is it now?
"They had a six-point guide and now it's four, so we carry it as a little moment I miss," said Jordan Spieth when he finished for the day.
Europe’s advantage, of course, has four points forward with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have a little wind in the sail, but they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and got home three points of four.
Spieth has been washed from tea to green and provides a good example.
The winestrip was much higher when his round continued and he dropped a decisive score to take the match four all-square when he and Thomas had played two after two after two games.
His poem that won them the match at 15 met with a similar noise, with the conviction that the American law is not out of the game yet.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own match," said Spieth.
That's all these players have left.
18 to say.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cups undisputed story.
Europe's outside but boring couples are four from four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back on Friday morning.
These performances and public reactions confirm that they are players to hit on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could get home a potential European winner when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
I represent both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, tomorrow's fireball hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on front nine dropped the Spanish and Swedish in a hole that they never even came near to claim.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you out of the hole.
Fireball and foursomes are so fascinating to look at close ties due to the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can be changed at a moment.
Europe has played better than it has done so far and has taken a significant lead before the last day, but this four-month session also showed that the team of the United States had a fight like some, especially on the US side, had doubts.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cups last day after coming out of the fireball and foursome match with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duon Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led two victorys over a sealed Tiger Woods and took home all four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Björn's European Law, which fought to keep the poker they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American law that never really started during the morning fireball with 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursom and won two matches, but it wasn't enough to win.
Jim Furyk's law needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the poker.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in row while he and Molinari, baptized to "Molliwood", after a sensual weekend, only the second pair is to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cups history.
After Crossing Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fireball, they beat an exhausted Woods and American Rokey Bryson Dechambeau with a more impressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who fought through two matches on Saturday, showed evidence of one hour of brilliantness, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fireball and foursome, and seven of them in row.
Justin Rose, wanted during the morning fireball and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 winner over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not have the whole way, but it was a nice, blue day in the south-west of Paris.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the target for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They came home winner with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a fireball and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4 & 3 in a foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only two times in Ryder Cups history has a layer come back from a four-point basement in single-games, but Furyks' page needs only an unsolved result to keep the poker.
After having been the best for two days, it looks like an attack on Sunday can be difficult to get through.
North Korea says they "never" will leave alone without confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations today that continued sanctions would deepen their mistrust against the United States and it was not possible for the country to issue its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's annual General Assembly that in recent years North Korea had taken "significant measures to show its goodwill", for example by stopping nuclear and missile testing, disassemble the installations for nuclear testing and promise not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
"However, we see no corresponding answer from the United States," he said.
"Without any trust in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there will be no chance that we will individually withdraw ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a approach divided into stages of nuclear power that would result in the gradual reward of North Korea, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject a single nuclear solution as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between a situate US President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work towards "development of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first withdraw its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also thanked negotiations for facilitating severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on "development first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose by force and even against "the declaration of end-war", says Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can be imposed on us on our knees is a dream of the people who do not know about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leaders highlighted in the UN earlier this week.
Instead of three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months, the Minister said: "If the party to this issue of nuclear weapons had been South Korea and not the United States, the Korean half of nuclear weapons would not have come to such a death."
However, the tone in Ri's speech was dramaticly different than last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to achieve US position with rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "racetman" on a suicide mission.
In the year in the United Nations, Trump, who in general threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his refusal to take measures for disarmament, but it said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is dissolved.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months," no role is played".
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The maintenance of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with force and without failure until we realize a complete, final, verifiable defeat."
The Security Council has consistently reinforced the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to undermine the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met Ri in connection with the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip wasn't going well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. However, North Korea accused him several hours later of putting in place "gaster-like requirements".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to detonate a missile facility and also a nuclear power plant about the United States adopted "comparative measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "comparative measures" he sought were security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore and were opposed to normalising the relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has been given to all doctors to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture to study with caffeine-filled "diggers".
Academic study found that students at the world’s leading university are often unintended about their own reasons for taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, formed the course he considers to be the first in his fall in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after discussing the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of it a girl came up to me and said, 'Why can't I know this until now, in my last year?'
She said she had never told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organized for the first time this year, explains to the students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University of Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding out that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive data.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room where students click on coffee cups, gardens, coaches and books to learn about the effects of coffee and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleeplessness and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants can learn how long-term sleep failure can increase the risk of heart attackers, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the management of the students directly.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," Professor Czeisler said.
The culture of "digna" still exists, he says and allowed modern technology and constant increasing pressure on the students meant that sleeplessness was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to deal with stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - also to avoid weight loss because sleeplessness puts the brain in danger and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and have read one of his courses last year in Harvard during his first year.
He said that the course was an eyebrower and inspired him to campaign for a campaigning course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctors to complete a similar study program before they start their studies at the high-level institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting up a alarm for when to stand up and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can make you turn to the day, which leads to confusion.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Megas targets reduce Gerard's men
Ranger's lead was another loss today when Dolly Mengas striker sent Steven Gerard's uneven page to a 1-0 bottom floor in Livingstone.
The Ibrox side was out after taking his first victory on the road since February 4-1-triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's law delivered Gerard's second landing in 18 matches as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbrokes Premiership Leader Harts.
Several hit seven minutes before half-time and Ranger's never managed to match the result.
While Rangers now falls down to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third and lies only behind Hibernia on a target difference.
And there may be more problems at stake for Rangers after the line called Callum Spence was forced to be treated for a year after an object was cast from the outside end.
Gerard made eight changes in the semi-final of Betfred Cup.
The other side went with the same Livi 11 that took a point of Hearts last week and he would have been happy about how his well-wishing games were overflew the opponents every time.
Rangers must have dominated it, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been a goal already two minutes in the match when Mengas first passed through Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his great chance and shot out.
A free park at the bottom of Keaghan Jacobs was then reached by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the back seat.
Rangers took control of the match, but it seemed to be more than believing in their games during the last third part of the match.
Alfredo Morelo certainly felt he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless collated, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian request.
Rangers succeeded only in making two targets in the first half but earlier this Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly took easy on Lassana Coulibalys Nick and a soft park from Ovie Ejaria.
Livis opened the door at the 34th minute must have gone against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their cousins deserved it.
Once again, Rangers failed to handle Jacob's persistent situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher applied to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the exchange gave almost immediate effect when the outside hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly jumped out of his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get the opponents to play exactly the type of games they think about, with Lithgow and Halkett that changed long after long adaptation.
Holt's side could have strengthened its leadership in the last phase, but McGregor was well able to stop Jacobs before Lithgow Nicked outside after the corner.
Ranger's deputy Glenn Middleton had another late requirement for punishment when he was arrested with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Founder of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a discovery that led to manicure called Geiger measurementer.
Geigermeators have become a foundation for science since then and are also largely in pop culture, as well as in the 1950's film "Bells of Coronado", with the main role in their seemingly unsanitary cowpoke researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger miner, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these particles on you, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that are derived from the radioactivity of the minerals. "Evans:
Evans said, "Yes, it's popping up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63-year-old day.
But the discovery bearing his name continues.
New cancer vaccines can teach immune defense to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccines can teach immune defense to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccin teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method means extracting immunities from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancer forms and then re-injected.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancer forms.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to feel cancer again, saw their ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immunities from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many forms of cancer called HER2 and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our result is that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 " promotes the growth of several types of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and thoracic cancers, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immunities from patients and "learn" them how to deal with cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by bringing a MAGA catch after his SNL presentation.
It wasn't that good.
Kanye West was expelled from a study during Saturday Night Live after a failed performance where he promised US President Donald Trump and said he himself would apply for the post 2020.
After performing his third song for the night, Ghost Town, where he had a Make America Great-Keeps, he ran against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, "How can you think about Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL launched the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood star drew up by Brett Kavanaugh's witness board before the Senate's legal committee on allegations of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, the recording of West's exhibition was loaded on social media by comer Chris Rock.
It's obvious if Rock tried to drive West with the installation.
West had also complained to the public that he had been dragged backstage for his headquarters.
"They pushed me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that cap."
They're moving me!
And then they say I'm sickly low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to also fall low?" and said he would "set my supermancape on, because it means you can't tell me what to do.
Test with love."
His comments attracted more than twice from the public and employees from SNL seemed generated, reported Variety. One person said, "It was a death test in the studio."
West had entered as a later substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
The West disturbed many with its appearance of the song I Love it, dressed in a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: TACK FOR YOUR STOD ON YOUR MOBBEN."
But the speechshowen's worth, Karen Hunter, tweeted that the West was simply "self and it's perfectly beautiful."
"But I chose INTE to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art") I think a ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
That's what we're gonna do. She's allowed.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter reported that he had changed his name and said he was now "the former-known being as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
The rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and of course the native musician Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Judgment for attempted murder after knife cutting at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old was charged with attempted murder after a man was kidnapped at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
It happened in Ballyhackmore, the police said.
The answer is expected to be found at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The complaints will be examined by the complainant authority.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington hits toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his violent role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent media fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the chess player, 31, has said negative about the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be proud to be respected.
In a speech to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something has gone wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem with toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, too, admitted that he felt "ganska strong" to take the problem away.
"I personally feel quite strong, right now-- where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men in view of the problems we now see?"
Kit believes that TV can partly be responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to its very male characteristics.
He continued, "What's inborn and what's learned?
What does it teach on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they must be in a certain way in order to be a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not do any Game of Thrones followers when the series came to an end next summer and said he was "ready with fields and horses".
Since November, Kit will play in a new game of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a miner.
The shooter recently discovered that he thought his wife Rose's meeting was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks for the series, so she gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ybritte, which Kit's character Jon Snow loves in, in Emmys winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been killed in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only during the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transferred through six and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is spread rapidly through certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected by HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV infection through assembly is an acute issue in the Chinese HBT community.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBT persons is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men earlier or later will marry women.
Many of the infections are due to insufficient protection in combination with these relationships.
The Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicine since 2003 as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to personalize the data of the GOP Senator, due to "hazardous lies" and "conspiracies"
The US Congressman Maxine Waters condemned on Saturday the claim that one of her employees had posted personal data on three U.S. senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these claims were spread by right-wing extremism websites.
"Ladies, lies and more proficient lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information includes information according to the address and telephone number of the senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill under a Senate panel's request for complaints of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The doctor came once after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the item was associated with Water's office and released information about a member of Water's staff, reported Hill.
"This baseless claim is completely false and absolutely false," Waters continued.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been advanced as a result of these false and false claims - were not in any way responsible for the production of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and absolutely false."
Water's speech received quick criticism online, including from Vita Huset's former press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"This excitement is hot," Fleisher wrote.
"This means that she does not have the time to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they don't have to be angry.
They can't be faithful.
They shall not question the reasons of the applicant.
They must be calm and content."
Fleishers seemed to try to compare Water's reaction with the criticisms of judges Kavanaugh, who were accused of being mad during the winter days.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who applied for the appointment of Waters in the middle of the term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Fuck about the truth," he tweeted.
In her speech Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and anti-crime agents of these fraudulent requirements.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit meanings in each new movie with British escape, and the same seems to be true of this new play of the latest Johnny English action comedin - a series of spy parodys that were fired in 2003 with Johnny English and was re-lived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there water rates about how clearly bad we are becoming the new export product of the nation?
In any case, the competent Johnny English has been authorized by the customs authorities to renew the customer's business for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a wide-ranging comitique creation intended for the biopublic even in non-English countries
He is of course the key secret agent, who, despite his dire demands on smoothieeglamour, has received a little bit of Clouseau, a gnutt Mr. Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the OS in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveling and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There's one or two nice moments in the last JE movie
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medium-sized equipment and when the rotor blade struck his neck for a short time.
Atkinson's speech for physical comedy is shown, but humor is quite low and artificially overflowing, especially since the "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
Humorn feels as if it is adapted for children rather than for adults and for me Johnny English is a constituencies not as exciting and focused as Atkinson's lead film bravades in the role of Bean.
The current topic is now that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's super secret network of spies, revealing the identity of all British agents out in the field, to the agent in the great disadvantage of service - an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last street for a prime minister who is a pump and hard-working figure, who is already suffering from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but the manual does not offer much to work with.
Her informant informs her that when each individual active spy is taken, she must use someone who has retired.
And it means the leading Johnny English in its own high-ranking person, now an employee who is a teacher in some well-educated institution, but who offers informal lessons in art to work undercover on the side of it.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an acute meeting and is reunited with its former long-lived sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an undercover, a jolly hockey-sticks role where Vicki Pepperdine is near the city.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terribly wrong at Her Majesty's Secret Service and supports Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In time, the Prime Minister will fall hard on the charismatic technologist, who claims he can solve the British computer breach: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their oyysse of pharynxed behavior: dressed to servers, they set fires on a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they swim on Volta's luxury boat; and English releases clean anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the last sequence, but although the film is both charming and expensive, it has an air of children-TV around it.
I mean, I mean, I guess I'll do anything like that.
And as with the other Johnny English films I can't be thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his tongue?
Labor refuses to develop a plan for Brits to work for a four-year-old week but get wages for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's party Labor reviews a radical plan that shows that the British work for a four-day week - but is paid for five.
According to the information provided by the Party, business leaders are leaving savings made through the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but keep the same pay.
According to sources, the idea of "pass" with the party's economic agenda would benefit workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by trade union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic changes.
A senior representative in Laboror told The Sunday Times: An examination of police is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen one day, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits into the party's position to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the Party The Greens who promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this objective is not listed by Labor as a whole.
A speaker for Labor said: "A four-year-old's work week is not the party's policy and it's not the party's agreement."
Skuggscans John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw the power from "invisible leaders" and "sniffer" of state companies.
The plans of the Smuggling Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies can't get back all their efforts, as a Labour Government can make "derogate" because of what they consider to be wrong actions.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in company management and create so-called Inclusive Ownship Funds where 10 per cent of the private company's own capital is transferred to its employees, which is then to receive annual allocations of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell in the TV program "60 minutes" if the FBI's study of Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the Agency's investigations could allow some Republican senators to change their position on the matter.
In an interview sent on Sunday, "60 Minutes" by Scott Pelley, the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked whether the FBI could reveal something that would lead to their change of mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went into the interrogation, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened that the claim came out and said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, convinced, unconscious."
However, Graham's voice seems awful.
"I have already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite complaint," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Board strongly rejected it," Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new being changed."
What is Global Citizen Festival and has done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be worth the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive setting of stars that rise and an equally impressive task; to combat world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocked to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the event's real goals: to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival is, according to a 2012 statement, an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international language group that hopes to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteer work, email a world leader, call or otherwise meaningfully contribute to raising awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a renewed way to convince people to act, or is it only so called "clickivism" - people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has stated that more than 19 million "actions" have been recorded by its supporters as fighting for a number of different goals.
It is said that these measures have helped to track world leaders' commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect life for more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and notifications arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the accumulated assets have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in Britain between investors and actors who are committed to "help children develop their full potential", promising to give Rwanda $35 million in order to contribute to combating malnutrition in the area after having received more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can do social injustice as a bottomnote in history," said Ambassador of the partnership Tracey Ullman to the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken requiring the United Kingdom to improve the cost of mothers and children, the Government announced funding of the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes food programmes aimed at 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the common questions on its website: "What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-participation movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who attend the event of the year in New York, whose values are Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports indicate the Interior Minister
The Government may "if necessary" use its fleet to prevent Russian energy operators from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, by American Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - especially where it works at the invitation from the legitimate government - is a premise to explore new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he said.
And he says there's a way and a means to get rid of it.
"The US has the ability to ensure, with our fleet, that the maritime routes are kept open and, if necessary, to apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group called the "energy consumer's vote" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are really the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and exchange fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "day-old" with an economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement will follow that the Trump administration has aimed at increasing exports of its moving natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin "prison".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline of 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They claim that Washington's opposition to the project is only motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was rejected by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly regret that a third party interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "well-founder" if she will set up in the 2020 presidential election," says Senator Massachusetts.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "well-founder" around her participation in the presidential election after the US's mid-year election.
At a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider setting up as a candidate.
"It's a day for women to move to Washington and fix our tragic government and it includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take a real fundraiser to apply to the presidential post."
Warren referred to President Donald Trump during the council meeting and said he "has taken this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been freer in his criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not think she would apply for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "secret" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not apply, according to a study carried out by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent supported the candidate.
The study showed more support for a candidate before Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent for a potential candidate and 48 per cent against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Biden said he would decide officially in January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after taking acquisition in September.
He was arrested and charged with violence at home on Monday night.
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through now when he's back, I can relate to other families who have experience of PTSD and part of the trauma our soldiers return with," she said to the public at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest for "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they will come back as other people, they will come back honored, they will come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and refugees and all the other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, attempting to prevent a report on domestic violence and the possession of weapons in a state of disrepute, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Colombia support the issue of a new asylum policy
Arton states and the District of Colombia support a legal test aimed at a new American policy that refuses asylum to victims of genocide or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges police, reported NBC News.
The full name of the charity in the case of Grace v. Sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the police has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gang members" missed her, but American officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
Lawyers from the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries producing a large number of asylum seekers, which are nations facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy changed a 2014 decision by the immigration authorities which allowed illegal immigrants to seek asylum in order to escape from domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorneyney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores dozens of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances in which the claim applies, and such provision conflicts with the principle," according to the friend-of-the-court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that policies that deny the entry of immigrants damage the US economy and argue that they are more willing to become entrepreneurs and "give necessary labour".
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered judges in June asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and violence.
"Asyl is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or political opinion," said the session on 11 June.
Asyl was never meant to solve all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the number of deaths doubled in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked more and more intense.
"It feels very exciting," said 35-year-old mom Lisa Kusuma, who comforted her febrile boy in an evacuation center in Palu.
"The ambulance gets dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a waste."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, crawling through damaged property and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and ill, who were injured in the earthquake at 7.5 were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who were killed by a broken back and axel, wandered outside the hospital of Palu's Army Hospital, where the patients were treated outside because of continued severe relapse.
With tears in his eyes, he told me that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughters.
"We don't fly.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I think," told Haris for Associated Press and allowed his family to be in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador of China complained about "mobbling" with "propagandistic ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in an American daily about the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily paying a fine in the Des Moines Register - state Iowa's best selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to cooperate in the US's 6th Congress, something China refuses.
Trump's complaint that Beijing tried to mix in American elections marked what American officials told Reuters was a new phase in a climbing campaign from Washington to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are, for the occasion, locked in a ecliptic trade war with high rates of imports.
In the past, Chinese reparation rates were designed to kill exporters in such countries as Iowa, which is supported by Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, says Branstad in a discussion article in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, "now doubles the movement by putting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"The Chinese government uses America's expensive tradition of freedom of opinion and a free press to spread propaganda by publishing paid ads in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newspaper box on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of disparate votes and will not see any real reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economy, as media is ruled by the Chinese Communist Party's irony," he wrote.
He allowed "one of China's most prominent newspapers to refuse the offer to publish" his article, even if he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans fear female voters in the mid-year elections through the Kavanaugh Fish, warning analysts
Since many high-level republics defend the Supreme Court's so-called Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a relapse, especially from women, during the next election.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the elections.
It is impossible to turn back the clock, says Grant Reeher, professor of state science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s last attempt at an FBI investigation will suffice to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national speaker for the progressive movementOn group on Friday, according to Washington, DC.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators were scanning "November" when they demonstrated in the hall to the late building when the Republicans who control the judicial committee chose to proceed with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the witness target of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, told Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go into action," told Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, for the news site.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still undetermined female voters in the majority and younger voters, 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the President, often do not vote."
Prior to Ford's public testimony with allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a backlog could follow if the Republicans were pressed by confirmation.
"This has become a confusing drive for GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of Republican, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the Committee's vote or the final vote or about Kavanaugh coming through, it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, Head of Priorities USA, a group helping democratic elections, for the news channel.
But the Americans in general seem to be divided over whom they will believe in the cool water of Fords and Kavanaugh's witnessing goals, and later it seems to be the most widely believed.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford's testimony board, while 35% said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying under his testimony board, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as those from at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Because during the last week, Kavanaugh was severely attacked by 17-year-olds before the Senate's court committee.
Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposed his sexual organs to her while they participated in a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The discoverer of World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of World Wide Web, launchs a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which persons have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee ridiculed that the purpose behind Inrupt is "world Dominance".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data size" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, making lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a web browser at the same time.
What's unique with the personal online data entry is that it's completely up to the user who can access any type of information.
The company calls it "personal authority through data."
The idea with Inrupt, according to VD John Bruce, is that the company should take resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, a part of the programme developers to work with the project and a group of volunteers.
From this week onwards, technical developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are placed on top of one night.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In an investment on Media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid website.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he established World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential vote in the debate on network neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era on the web," Berners-Lee admitted.
Bernard Vann: Priest blessed with Victorian courses during the first world war
The only priest in the English Church who was rewarded with a Victorian course during World War I is now celebrated in his home city 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the award for his action during the attacks on Bellenglishe and Lehacourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed by a prickshock four days later and never knew he had been awarded the most prestigious price of the British military.
A monument was discovered by his two children during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his children, Michael Vann, said that it was "brillantly symbolic", that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his father was rewarded with the price.
According to London Gazette Lt Col Vann on September 29, 1918, his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "by a very thick dark and heavy fire from field and machine fire."
He later stepped up to the shooting line and led the "great losses" line forward before he decided on his own.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German peak shot on October 4, 1918 - less than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his father's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm very gentle in front of."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a cranna after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "was very ashamed to play a role in the parade" and allowed "a real hero to be challenged by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stood up all night looking at Bellator 206 and got instead of seeing Greta Gris
Imagine this, you've stood up all night to see Bellator 206 just to be refused to look at the main audience.
Shown from San Jose included 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown alive at night in Britain on channel 5.
At 06:00, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the British observers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were poorly impressed after they had kept awake to the early morning hours to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a characterized child program as "a sick joke".
"It was the government's decision that the content was not so early in the morning, so they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice-president vd for marketing and communication when he was asked about the shipment.
"Greece grey, yes."
Bellator's VD Scott Cooker said they will work with their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we'll be able to find a solution for the reprieve," said Coker.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, the software exchange has caused many to lose their lives.
We tried to take action, and we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it was actually a state issue.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We're going to show five matches instead of six, as we usually do. We took the water over our head in our endeavor to satisfy the fan.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "substance" due to sexuality
Olympic poet Tom Daley says that he felt under the influence of his comrades during his growing up because of his sexuality - but it also motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize that he wasn't like everyone else before he went to high school."
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give others "hop".
He also said he was less concerned about winning the OS after becoming parents.
The popular show's regular programmer, Kirsty Young, has been free for several months due to illness.
During his first meeting at Lavernes, Daley relates how he felt "less worth" than others during his childhood, because "it was not socially acceptable to think about boys and girls".
He said: "This feeling of being inferior to me and of being different has been a real source of strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so he didn't fail everyone when they were so young that they got to know his sexuality.
The two-fold Olympic bronze medalist has become a highly profiled advocate for HBT rights and has used its appearance at the Year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt that he had the tour to live openly without restrictions and would give others "hop".
The three-year-old world teacher said his love in a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "come as a surprise".
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar's winner last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age," he participated in his first OS as 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age with similar experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole life perspective" had been changed.
"If you had asked me last year it was just about winning gold," he said.
"But you know, there are more things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad didn't agree that he would die and one of the last things he had asked if they got their tickets to the Olympic Games in London 2012 - where he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him you won't be able to sit on the front row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead which I finally recognized that he wasn't invincible," he said.
That year, Daley competed at the OS 2012 and won a bronze.
"I knew only that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to drown before a local public on an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It was also inspired by his first choice - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him to the OS and still gave him excitement.

Mickelson out of shape on the bank during the day of the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will hit record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he has to fix the form to avoid an unfortunate midship.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in row, was bled by Captain Jim Furyk for the four-day ball and four-some.
Instead of being in the center of events, which he has often been for the United States, the fifth winner spent his day doing heiklock and training on his game in hopes of getting a chance to demonstrate his ability.
He has never been the most radical of drivers, not even at the top of his career and the 48th year is not in the shape of the Tuft Road on Le Golf National, where the long call often loses its weight.
It's not just the way out, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson met Master Francesco Molinari, who along with the newspaper Tommy Fleetwood won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below the 12 single matches, have won the game at the beginning, it can be quite decisive for Mickelson's match.
Furyk expressed confidence for his player, not because he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a stick on my back and left his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"His self-confidence is no mistake.
He's a famous and he's done so much for these laws in previous seasons and in the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two matches.
I thought he'd be better, but now it's what it is, and we'll have fun with it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mikkelson Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches was played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully lived up to the heights of its individual results.
Mickelson has 18 years, 20 losses and seven months, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities to the building.
"He's cool, he's sardistic, funny, he likes to laugh with people and he's a good guy to have in the act," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players thought it was fun to play with him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a memory piece
Thomas Björn, European Captain, knows from experience that a significant leadership in the last day's singles in Ryder Cup can quickly be transformed into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in 1997 at Valderama, where a layer under Seven Ballester's leadership benefited a five-point advantage over the Americans but finally watered with the lowest possible margin with result 1411⁄2-131/2.
"You remember that we led a great deal on Valderama, we led a great deal on Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won with hardship and thirst," said Bjorn (on the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday and leading with 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone in the layer that this isn't over.
We'll do everything tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
This is not over until we see the points on the table.
Our goal is to try to win this poker and it's where our focus is.
I've said it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of what awaits on the other side - the world's best players."
The bees were pleased with their players' performances on a tuff golf course and allowed: "I would never be able to do this myself.
Tomorrow is waiting for new challenges.
Tomorrow is the individual performances that apply and it's a completely different thing.
It's nice to be out with a partner when it goes well, but when you're out there on your own, your ability as a golf player is tested.
It is the message you need to deliver to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself."
In contrast to Björn, opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than those who did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who spent three points at home.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of major revolutions during the last days of a competition, both in the winning layer in Brooklyn before he ended up losing when Europe ran "Miracle to Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he replied when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, Captain 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to go out as quickly as at Brooklyn, as at Medinah.
When the temperature reaches one level, there will be a lot of pressure on these interstellar machines.
We did our creation and placed the guys we wanted to make, you know, make some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was commissioned to try to lead the fight and meet Rory McIllroy in the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the upper half of the scheme.
"I went with this group of guys in this system because I think it's enough the whole way," Björn said about his single choices.
Germany's new warships are re-established
The German fleet's latest fleet would have been seabed 2014 to replace warships from the time of the so-called war, but it will not be seabed until at least next year because of incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the crew of the whole new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has now been shot up to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper citing a military speaker.
The ship should have joined the fleet in 2014, but the problems arising after delivery were destroyed for the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuertemberg class that the fleet ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen frigates.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a series of air protection and marine missiles, as well as certain beautiful techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the latest questions for up to two years without contact with the door.
But continuous delays mean that the flagship warships - which allows Germany to design power abroad - are already advanced when they are taken into operation, writes Die Zeit.
The devastating F125 frigate created headings last year when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship in operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
A little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media identified a number of important "software and machineware wafers" that made the warship worthless if it was used on a fight mission.
Lacks in the software were particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of about 120 seamen - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It has also been observed that the ship has a significant surplus, which leads to impaired performance and limits the ability of the sea to carry out future upgrades.
The 7000 tonnes of "Rheinland-Pfalz" are assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from incorrect hardware, the entire project's price drop - including training of crew - is also a problem.
It has been said that it has been committed to misleading EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion in the start-up market.
Problems affecting the most recent issues become particularly important in the light of the latest warnings that Germany's fishing power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet was actually "consuming a lack of fully equipped ship".
The officer said it was a growing problem, since old ships were being abandoned but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the questions in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the sea.
National Trust is listening to the secret life of the gladdermuseum
A new research carried out on an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how gladdermös uses landscapes in their quest for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the management of unique flying mammals and help control future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at National Trust for Scotland, will follow South and South and South-West Pistrill, as well as brown long-term and Daubington gladdermöss at Inverwe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special players will be placed on important sites around the property to track gladder activity throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using manual detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of gladdermous sounds and what species to do.
An environmental map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area image of their management.
Rob Dewar, Nature Advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of life that are most important for the gladdermuseum and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of environmental management such as the creation of angels and how best to maintain forests for gladdermös and other related species.
Flanders populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have decreased significantly during the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the well-being and loss of the environment.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as a plane and certain chemical treatments of construction materials and attackers from memory.
Fladdermöss isn't really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the exchange.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to find insects and prevent them from flying.
NTSC, which is responsible for the protection of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes care of gladdermuses on a large scale.
The organisation has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, examine bonuses and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated flagdermus reserve at Three Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten flagdermous.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here on Tree we have a good area for gladdermös," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of veterinary buildings and a lot of useful living environments.
But there is much about flagdermousness that is still unknown, so the work we do here and in other properties helps us to understand more about what they need to be pursued.
He stresses the importance of looking for gladdermös before maintaining in properties, as it is possible that an unforeseeable destruction of a single home could result in up to 400 honours and young people, and possibly inflate a whole population.
Fladdermöss is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, question or destroy them or destroy their bond.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have much to learn about our flagderms and too many of our species we don't know how their populations are."
Ronaldo refuses violence while his lawyers threaten to vote in the German newspaper
Christian Ronaldo has called the charges of violence against him for "false news" and says that people "will be marketed" by using his name.
His lawyers will agree with the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus have been charged with violence against an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas 2009.
He is alleged to have paid her $375 000 to keep the event quiet, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a Live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) quoted the reports as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, only hours after the requirements were reported.
"It's not her. It's her.
What they said today was false news," said the fifth winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's good," said the player and log.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to agree with Der Spiegel on the claim, which they have called "an unauthorized reporting of doubts about integrity", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "the moral damage to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event was said to have taken place in June 2009 in a Swedish store at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he was supposed to have abused her anal, according to documents submitted by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99%" a "good guy" failing the "last percent".
According to the document, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that they agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed on a comparison because she felt "fear for revenge" and was worried about "betrayed public".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to cancel the comparison because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged defeat, and in the summer he moved to the Italian village Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: Great Britain "comes forever" to lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "will always regret it" if you lost your status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Minister of Business Greg Clark said.
He admitted that it was "no wonder" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain had left the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer reported that the effects of delays at the border in the event that no agreement could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150 000 cars in bulk, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see production stop in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, Toyotas vd in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concern about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini facility in Oxford within one month after Brexit.
The main problem concerns what car manufacturers say is the risk of the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without solution.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU for cars ordered.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may lead to disturbances at the border that the industry says can lead to delays and shortcomings in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's consumption in stocks at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus the production would be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future EU relations is "exactly calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need a solution. We want the best agreement possible, as I say, not only for the present success of the assessment, but for us to take this opportunity." he told BBC Radio 4's programme Today.
"The challenges of not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we must certainly be able to continue what has been a very successful set of suppliers."
Toyota could not tell how long the production would stop, but more recently warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and thus cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is head of the Unit trade union at the factory, said his members are always concerned: "My experience is that these jobs never come back.
One government official said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trumps met with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein would be able to "shut up for another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court named Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work with Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian involvement in the election, relations between Trump and Russia and the President's potential obstacle to justice.
Huruvida Trump will shoot the contributing minister of justice, and thus adventure Mueller's independence, has been fueled by Washington's storms for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of bringing hearing equipment to play talks with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through the 25th addition of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reported that he was going to leave.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced, which was then held at UN headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "pretend" not shoot Rosenstein but then was late to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal committee hearings where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of complaints against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
The press secretary of Trump, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for this has not been set, this week can happen, or one week later, in view of all other matters that are taking place at the Supreme Court.
But we can see, and I always like to keep the press up-to-date."
Some reporters would argue that: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The value of Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences didn't depend on any foreign television reporters who "play for the gallery," even if she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President has more questions than any president has before him," she said and allowed without saying, "We have looked at these figures."
Conferences will still hold room, Sanders said, but if the press has the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is far better to talk to me.
We are trying to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in recent weeks and it will replace press conferences, and you can then ask the President of the United States directly."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the President may have shown why, with the spontaneous statements and sometimes stronger representations before the rapporteurs.
Health Minister writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland with concern about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in the NHS of Scotland to express the country's gratitude and the desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the costs of advanced application for EU citizens working in the decentralised public sector.
In the letter Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU have continued to appear before decisions expected to come to the east.
But the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the efforts of each staff member, regardless of nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU, and the rest of the world, offer valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care and benefit the patients and society we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after he is struck by headache
Tennessee State Tiger's lineback Christion Abercrombie underwent an acute operation after having suffered a major loss of the hearing day with 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennesseans Mike Organ.
Tennessee State Chief Trainer Rod Reed told the reporters that the damage occurred about half an hour ago.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," said Reed.
Trainer and medical staff gave Abercrombie acid on the sideline before being placed on a bar for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris admitted that "there is no information on the type/wide nature of the damage" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a red-haired second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five thanks on Saturday before leaving the match, which gave him a total of 18 thanks.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when they buy an estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers may pay higher stamp tax when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and the extra money is used to help homeless people, according to the new plans of the Tory Party
The measure should neutralise Corby's success by attracting young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The British Ministry of Finance estimates to raise up 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be paid a higher stamp tax when they buy property in Britain. The extra money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's success by attracting young voters with the promise of more affordable housing and focusing on high-income people.
The increase in stamp tax will be taken out by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom. The extra money will give rise to the government's rate of combating homelessness.
The extra tax comes in addition to the current tax on stamps, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on holiday homes and apartments purchased for rent. It can be up to three percent.
The Department of Finance believes that the measure will amount to 120 million pounds per year.
In comparison, 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by people living outside the United Kingdom. This drives prices up and makes it more difficult for beginners to get a foot on the housing market.
Many well-equipped areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become spout cities because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new show will only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the stamp tax to help younger people to buy their first home.
He accused a large construction company to keep prices up by buying up land without using it, and asked Theresa May to withdraw from allowances on housing at affordable prices to solve the "disquieting housing situation of the United Kingdom."
Jeremy Corbyn has launched an exciting enough proposal for housing reforms, including rentals and an end to cuts without the disparity of the tenant.
He also wants to give the municipalities the opportunity to build new homes.
Theresa May says: "Last year I said that I would spend my time as prime minister to restore the British dream, that life would be better for every new generation.
This means solving the problems on the housing market.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in Britain, and even for companies who are based abroad, to buy dwellings such as for hard-working residents in our country.
The dream of owning its home has become just a distant dream for too many people, and homelessness is still an invaluable fact."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "final goal" is that once he becomes Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old shot faces the challenge of blowing up life in the club from northeastern England, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer after having made St. Mirren return to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a match in the B-lander and it was all," says Ross to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But when I grew up, I looked a lot at Scotland on Hampden with my father, and it has always locked me back.
But that chance can only come if I succeed in leading a club."
Among Ross's representatives are Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says he was not concerned about meeting such a established name in such a large club. He has previously thanked no for the offer from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"Just now I appreciate the answer to the question 'can I get this club back to Premier League?'
This club is absolutely home in the Premier League, given its structure and talent," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period of time as an assistant trainer in Dumarton and a 15-month stay as a member of the Heart's training team.
Then he helped Alloa to return from the downturn to the third division, and raised St. Mirren from being close down to becoming winner of the master's title in the season.
Ross says he's more satisfied now than ever during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a reason for the road," he recalls and hopes when he took the command over Allao.
"I really thought leadership was totally right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had bad results and could live up to it, and I had some great success.
But playing can be fun.
It's a lot to take care of every week.
It's still stress and stress at work for me, but training feels quite right.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it better than I've ever done in my adult life."

A study shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The summer’s heat waves have resulted in increased revenues for the country’s combative pubs, but the restaurant chains have got more pressure on themselves.
Figures showed that pub and bar companies increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurants' income decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin from CGA's consulting company, who has compiled the figures, said: "The beautiful weather continued and the fact that England remained in VM longer than expected implies that we had seen a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs went up by 2.8%.
The decrease in the turnover of restaurants by 1.8% in June has only increased in July.
Pubars and bars that offer drinks above all showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that went up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubars offering food also had difficulty in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People seem just wanted to go out and drink something.
The output of managed pipes and bars rose by 6.6 % per month, and the sales of food decreased by 3 %."
Paul Newman of the RSM service and entertainment industry says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and large sports events are still the most important factors in the sale of large-scale kitchens.
It is not surprising that restaurants still have difficulties, although a 4.8% reduction in sales per year is particularly difficult to deal with beyond current cost pressures.
The long summer could not have become more illegal for companies driven by food sales. It is time to show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give any proper respect."
The total sales demand for pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, fell by 2.7% in July. This reflects the fact that less new brands are now being launched.
Business sales supervisor Caffer Peach Tracker for the pub-bar and restaurant industry in Britain collects and analyzes information on how 47 active groups are dealing with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds, and is a set of guidelines in the industry.
One of the five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents
A study shows that one of five children, sometimes as young as 11 years of age, has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents and teachers.
A study of 20 000 students at the university and gymnasium shows an increase in the number of false Instagram sites
The result has increased concern that it is sexual content placed there
20 % of students reported having a "main account" they showed to their parents
One of five children, some as young as 11 years old, creates an account on social media that they keep secret for adults.
A study of 20,000 students at the high school and gym showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Instagram", a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The result has been delayed by concern that it is sexual content placed there.
20% of students reported having a city's main account that they can show for their parents, and then they also have private accounts.
A mother who sneezed over her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a teenager who asked others to "violent me."
According to the study, conducted by the organizations Digital Awarenes UK and Headmasters and Head Mistakes Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them acknowledged that they had a private account.
The HMC president, Mike Buchanan, says: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are forced to create places online where parents and teachers don't find them."
Eilh Doyle will be "the voice of the heroes" in the board of the Scottish Peace Association, Scottish Athletics
Eilh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as an external board member at the annual meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most prized peacekeeper, and President Ian Beattie describes the choice as a unique opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of her broad experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilidh has won great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that the players in Scotland would benefit greatly from becoming a member of the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says: "I want to be a vote for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 meters at OS in Atlanta in 1996, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now an expert comment on BBC. He lost his ability to follow a mini-strake.
He writes on Twitter: "Today a month ago I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time had been shown to me to recover and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I've been completely recovered and kept, taught me to go back and now I'm doing mobility exercises!

Advertising for breast pumps that compare mothers with size parts of the Internet
A company selling breast pumps has caused divergence on the Internet with an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers with breast milk.
In order to note the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released a video-inspired film with humorous estimates to show the freedom of the new pump to pump breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a shackload of cards to a sound with text lines like, "Yes, I milk myself, but there's no snakes" and "If you didn't know that, this isn't nothing funny, but stupid."
The phrase continues: "Pamp out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the advertising film, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused online conflict.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from viewers. Many say it sheds light over the "fasor" of the meridian industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just like we have to become pregnant and fed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them just a few days after birth," writes one person.

Another comments: "I understand it's traumatic for both mothers and children.
But of course, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their children?"
Another person adds: "What a real-time advertising film."
Others defend the film, and one woman denies that she thinks the song is "hysterically fun."
"I think this is genius.
I'd have gotten one if I was still old.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The advertising film is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a generic product," writes someone.
Another comments: "This is a fun advertising film that turns to moms who pumps (usually on the job or on the toilet) and feels like 'cossor'."
This isn't a film that catches up with or condemns the mermaid industry."
At the end of the film, women discover that they have all danced with the discreet pump stuck in their pockets.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no cables or pipes and can be carried discreetly in an amputation pool, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is a participant and ECD on Mother, and she says: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves an expensive and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women who pump breast milk and milk, we would like to highlight breast pumping and the challenges with it, while we in a sustainable and easily identifiable way show the amazing feeling of freedom of the new pump.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump creates headings.
During London's fashion week, a two-year-old lady appeared on the catwalk with clothes from designer Martha Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp near the border of Texas
The number of migrant children deprived of their freedom has increased, although the number of persons crossing the border every month has been relatively unchanged. This is partly due to the fact that emergency rhetoric and strict policies introduced by the Trup government have made it more difficult to place children in reference persons.
In the past, most reference persons themselves have been paperless immigrants, and fear to place their own opportunities in the country of play by explaining themselves willing to accept a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult members of the household would be forced to leave fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Authority, witnessed before the Congress that the authorities had arrested thousands of persons who had requested to be referred to as single minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not known by the crime-fighting authorities since then.
"Nearly 80 % of those who are neither reference persons nor family members of reference persons are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to follow these individuals," said Albence.
In order to manage children’s affairs more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to be found in court within one month after their release was required, more than 60 days later, which was previously practice, according to staff at the premises.
Many of them are currently on video links faster than personal to bring their speech for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered entitled to protection shall be deported quickly.
The longer children are deprived of their freedom, the more likely they are to be affected by anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or refugee attempts, according to staff on the presentations and reports from the system in recent months.
Speakers say that concerns are rising at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs of a child’s being more likely to be ignored because of the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the city of refuge without getting enough time to prepare emotionally and take care of friends, they can harm the trauma of many already involved.
Syria requires US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to return immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouelem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country was within its eighth year.
Moualem, also Vice Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces are illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "will be dealt with in accordance with this."
"They must return immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the Government of Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred act until we have freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war - torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" which forces refugees to stay away.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They are policy-making something that should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no aid for rebuilding Syria before there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last great rebellion Idlib has created an opportunity to proceed with political talks.
The Russian-Turkey agreement triggered a massive attack by Russian-supported Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
However, Moulalem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadline" and expressed hope that a military intervention would be directed against Jihadists, including warmen from the Al Qaida-related Nusrafront, who "come to be punished".
The UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura is hoping to bring together the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government members and opposition members to draft post-war constitutions for Syria and the ban on elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and said that the work of the group would be limited to "review of the articles in the current constitution", and warned against involvement.
Why Donald Trump will win a change
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the 2020 turn if his presidency was not ended in the past through wealth and scandal, which many liberal viewers are probably hoping for.
In what no doubt would be "the most dramatic finale of a Presidency ever!"
There is no sign that the spectators have failed.
Since 2014, the viewing figures for the best delivery time have been more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times as high, 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best delivery time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topled the list of cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during major news nights.
"This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who drives the show for ABC's "Designed Survivor" drama, which deals with a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed Capitolium.
Nell Scovell is a multi-year comedy author and has written "Just the Funny Party: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club". She has another theory.
She remembers a tax trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The guy told me he'd vote on Donald Trump.
Then why? She asked.
"He said, 'To make me laugh,' says Nell Scovell to me.
There's a maintenance value in the case.
Of course it is so different from anything else on TV that Washington's report can determine the future of the legal case in abortion, Roe vs Wade, if immigrant families can be reunited and the well-being of the global economy.
Shutting down is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can offer.
However, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you have suddenly sat and watched a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" to his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bomberjack for $15,000 ("a plague filled with hybrids", as Washington Post said) and the significance of Stormy Daniel's macabre descriptions of Donald Trumps, um, anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario myself the same way again.
"A part of what he does to make it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, vd for Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pown Stars", about the Trump follow-up role playing and daily intruder (much green with NFL, promised Kim Jong-un).

When I spoke to the TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, it was the sun and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai in Hawaii, but he sat and looked inside and looked at MSNBC while he was playing a message from CNN.
He couldn't stand up, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be placed before the Senate's justice committee and the future of the Supreme Court was low in the classroom.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs before and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss said to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it proved they were right."

Money from flows into the most common race ever before the mid-year election
It is not surprising that the 17th Congress district of Pennsylvania receives a lot of money. It is thanks to the restructuring of a convention district that has made two members now compete in the same place.
This recently surrounded prefecture district in Pittsburgh is represented by the Democrat Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district at a special election in the past year.
Lamb campaigns against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus. He is currently represented by the old 12th district in Pennsylvania, which is largely above the new 17th district.
The cards were cited after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were constitutionally modified for the benefit of the Republicans.
The merger in the new 17th district has led to a campaign financing dispute between the major economic divisions of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a short win in a wide-guarded special election in March to the 18th convention district of Pennsylvania.
This place had been occupied by a republic for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts had given the democracies a certain source.
USA considered punishing El Salvador for China's support but then withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama, until the members joined the Trup Organisation's lead team.
The officials of the U.S. Foreign Department decided to call home the heads of American affairs in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan", the department's spokesman Heather Nauert said in a speech earlier this month.
But only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which was estimated at $140 million in US aid 2017. The money would include drug control and development and economic support.
The sanctions proposed, including reduced economic assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been severed against the Central American country with its high unemployment and mortality statistics.
At the same time as the internal meetings continued, American and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, high officials in the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held, which in practice stopped the consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now going to speak at the conference, which will now take place in mid-October, a sign of how important the presidential administration considers the meeting to be, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strong messages or punishments from Washington.
A speaker for John Bolton from Vita Huset refused to comment on the details of the debate, described by the three US officials, of which two diplomats were involved in discussing internal transactions against anonymity promises.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Study History
The next inevitable step can be the special investigator Robert Mueller's report on the alleged infringement of the case in law, which is now available in public registers.
Mueller is also reported to conduct his investigation on whether Donald Trump's campaign co-operated with Russia in its attack on the US elections.
If the convention would change the majority, Trump will be held responsible for the assembly as soon as he prepares for another election, and perhaps eventually for a citizen's jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor will his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to find different options, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how the output of the struggle can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to release a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the Western countries had taken his stand and put themselves behind the check-ups in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of the bloodbath that followed.
History surrounds such decisive events, and the uncertain progress of democracy is either accelerated or frustrated.
The Americans are now facing several of these decisive events.
What should we do if Donald Trump gives Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what's going to happen with Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper has reported that he has proposed to play the President in secret last year, and speculated that he would not be fit for the oath.
Rosenstein says The Times report doesn't agree.
"How should we respond if the recent requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he is allowed to attend the Supreme Court in spite of credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-year elections at a convention held by Donald Trump?
If we fail these tests, democracy is facing a dark period.
But I don't think we're gonna fail, because of that reading I learned in Prague.
My mother was Czech-Slovakia Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime as once occupied my embassy residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me on my way to wear Saturday lights on the table decorated with the jacket.
With that inheritance, how could I be more optimistic than the future?"

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic in front of the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday. They know that winning against the Austrians after the impressive Spanish match against Villarreal which ended undecided earlier this month will encourage them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A broken middle-fielder Graham Dorrans prevented his first performance for the season from reaching the 2-2 match against Villarreal. But he believes that Rangers can use the result as a language bridge against greater success.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good law," says the 31st year.
"We went into the match in faith that we could get something, and went from there with a point.
We might have been able to get it in the end, but in the large part, there was probably no fair result.
They must have been better in the first half, we came back in the second half and it was better.
Now on Thursday it will be an important evening in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it becomes a nice match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can probably smoke and get a good result.
Last year was very tense, with everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys are cool, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the previous season behind us and succeed."
Women sleep badly due to fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear picture of how they wanted to be remanded, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the country-wide study said they had talked to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the step and talk about it, said Holly Snyder, Vice President for Life Insurance at Nationwide.
This is where you can start.
Talk to your husband/mother and children: You can’t prepare your family for taking care of yourself if you don’t talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your consultant and your family and discuss where and how you want to care. Your choices may be of great importance for the costs.
Get help from your economic consultant: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your long-term funding options may include a traditional long-term insurance solution, a life-insurance hybrid solution with cash to cover the costs, or a self-insurance with your own funds if you have advice.
Create legal acts: Avoid legal disputes from the beginning.
Create a nursing capacity so that you can appoint a trusted person who sees your medical care and ensures that the care staff follows your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also an authority for your economy.
Then you choose a trusted person who can make economic decisions in your place and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are not able to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who gets into an acute medical condition and is on her way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so you're ready.
"It's not just the economy that's playing, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicine is it?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure the plan is ready."
Several times with airborne radiation in Ilfracombe
A man was beaten several times with air pollution when he walked home from an evening.
The victim, who is in the age of 40, was in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, arm and arm.
The police describe the shooting, which took place about 02:30, as a "unfortunate event".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The damage is not life-threatening, and the police are calling on the witness to hear it.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a violent earthquake and tsunami that killed the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday. It is expected to increase.
The communications are outstanding, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to get any information from the Doghea administrative area, a northern area of Palu located near the Earth’s epicenter. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Doghea, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Centrala Sulawesi, and is located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city’s population was estimated to 379,800 in 2017.
The city spread its 40-year-old jubilee when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dothraa is a management area that extends over 300 km from the northwestern Sulawesis coast.
The administrative area, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The beneficiaries of the Centrala Sulavesis economy are fish and agriculture. This is particularly true of the Doghua coast.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dodhaa have been killed by tsunamis several times over the past hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management authority.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Doghía.
Even 1996 was killed by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is in the circular seismic age, often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake at the west coast of the Indonesian Province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that killed 14 countries. 226 000 people lived along the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A number of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with magnitude 6.8 on Richterskalan struck south of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with magnitude 7.6 hit the nearby town of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A earthquake with magnitude 7.5 hit one of the Mintawai Islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten metres was triggered. Thousands of villages were destroyed and about 300 people were killed.
2016: A major earthquake struck the management area Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time no Tsunami was released, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed together.
2018: Great earthquakes struck the Indonesian tourist Lombok. More than 500 people died, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for violence at home
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaska Governor and Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for misconduct.
Palin, 29 years old and from Wasilla in Alaska, is accused of domestic violence, for having filed a report on domestic violence and for resisting the arrest, according to a report issued on the day of Alaska's sub-State police hearing.
According to the police report, he should have taken the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and reported the alleged crime.
Palin sits free in the Mat-Su hack and is held against the city at 500 dollars to be paid if the suspected breach is contrary to the public condition, according to the KTUU TV channel.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteed not guilty" when he was asked to present his position, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of less serious crimes under Class A, which means he can be held in prison for up to a year and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a case of less serious crimes under Class B, which is punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
That's not the first time that Palin was accused of crime.
In December 2017 he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now handled by the Alaska Veterinary Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, for having joined in the notification of domestic violence and for the possession of weapons under the influence of that event.
His girlfriend accuses him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin received criticism from veterinary groups in 2016 after she had linked her son's violent behaviour to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which is due to his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The electricity supply and communications are below, and death figures are expected to rise in the next days.
The earthquake struck immediately outside Central Sulawesi, which lies north of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Movies that show when it hits it is now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had been gathered to a beach festival in Palu when tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors work on a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are responsible for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist act in New York which killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been committed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, has been using a rental car from the construction and construction chain Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. He met footsteppers and cyclists on his way to the attacks, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death penalty, the prosecutors had to prove that Saipov "sightly" killed the eight victims and "sightly" caused serious bodily injury, according to the death penalty declaration submitted in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges may involve a death sentence, according to the Court's judgment.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with a federal jury at 22 points, including eight cases of murder in support of defence activities, which are often used by federal prosecutors for organised crime, as well as for traffic and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "wide planning and attitude", the complainants said, and described at the same time the way Saipov carried it out as "dissolved, cruel and human".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci," says the statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York's southern district has not reached a target where death penalty is imposed on a decade.
The alleged Khalid Barnes was killed by two hostages, but finally he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was finally carried out in a federal target in New York in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were sentenced to two years in prison for stamping up the Soviet Union as a spy during the so-called war.
The pair of Rosenbergs were set up in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, who is a Uzbek citizen, showed a lack of money during the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the agreement, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to attack after watching IS films on his phone.
He also asked to install the IS flag on his hospital room, the police assigned him.
He has not declared himself guilty of the 22 points of complaint in the agreement.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He stated that they are "probably disappointed" in the decision of the complainant.
"We believe that the decision to impose death penalty rather than to go to prison for life without the possibility of conditional release if it is recognized that it is only due to prolong the trauma caused by these events for all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to commit murder.
The Member of the Parliament of Tories says NIGEL FARGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must "know this" from EU shipyards, when one of those MEPs proposed that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative member Peter Bone said at the March in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "have gone out" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit Minister.
But the challenge facing Theresa May with regard to making the deeply shared accessions to reconciliation worsen by EU positive members, who have joined in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain its compromise plan, the Chequers Agreement, in the face of attacks by Brexitian supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU themselves.
Her allies have insisted that she should press on and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backlog, and force EU skippers and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "kaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he would "spoll the Chequers Agreement".
He pointed out that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood by the hole, we would have been out at this layer," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents the Wellingborough district of Parliament, admitted: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must break the Chequers Agreement".
He clarified his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought a world war to be underestimated.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the claims that the general opinion would have been changed since the 2016 referendum: "Thank you for the changes made by the British and now you want to stay forever."
Brexitan delegate Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party was also on the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is popular in the party and our voters who are out on the streets and make sure we are elected.
Leave the Chequers agreement and start listening."
And she lets a smart message to Theresa May: "The Prime Minister can keep his jobs when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must be "conscious of this" if they were to fail the decision taken in and with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us, that is to say the people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to break Brexit, and we're here today to say to them, 'We're not gonna let you go with it.'
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he said: "I want you to get our political class, which is about to fail Brexit, to feel this.
We mobilize the army of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, EU citizens marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists fanned with banners with the text "Tory Members against Brexit" after the group was launched in the weekend.
The Labour Parliamentarian Lord Adonis from the Supreme House held the conservatives for the security problem they supported with a stakep when the conference opened.
"These are the people who say they can have an IT system on the ground and all the techniques for Canada plus the plus agreement, for free-of-frequency borders and free trade without borders in Ireland," he admitted.
"It's a clean father.
There's no good Brexit," he said.
Warren is planning a "well-founder" to apply to the president's post
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take a "well-founder to apply to the presidential post" after the election in November.
The Boston Globe newspaper reports that the democracy from Massachusetts spoke about its future during a city-owned meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticised President Donald Trump, and is now referring to the Republican State's representative Geoff Diehl, who was Vice-President of the Donald Trump campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She's been the subject of speculation about maybe taking a Donald Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th city hall meeting with the voters since Donald Trump attended.
A person asked her if she was planning to apply to the president's post.
Warren replied that it is the day "for women to go to Washington to repair our tragic government, which means a woman at the top."
A person arrested for the death penalty of the basketball player Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for killing LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The police in Baton Rouge announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at 11 a.m. of a press conference.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man who looks at the pictures.
20-year-old Sims was shot to death near Southern University's campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died of this," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on the Saturday through the news site 247 sports.
Wade went between protecting his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was arrested and admitted he had been on the scene and had a gun, and he admitted he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and was taken to the police station at East Baton Rouge.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches with 10 starters last season, and weighed 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world's beginning after the teamman gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified himself before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' teammen would play a large role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and hung almost out Hamilton in the dark when he defended his position under the first two arms, and invited Vettel to attack his roommate.
Vettel went down first and allowed Hamilton to drive back to the club, which should have been decisive.
Mercedessen went to the roof a little later and came back to Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a little wheel-wheel-action where Ferrari's driver voluntarily left the inside free with a risk to offer on site after a double drag to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and fell seven at the end of the first yard on his 21st year.
He then led a large part of the race and held the decks to achieve a rapid measurement and run about Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
Finally, he arrived at the 44th floor but was not able to rise the temperature during the remaining eight yards when the Raikkonen went up to the fourth floor.
It is a difficult day because Valtteri did a great job all week and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an exceptional job and got one and two," Hamilton said.
Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump held a meeting of Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday, because she maintains that she has not been reading the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated as judges in the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual abuse.
The President, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly address Ford's point of view before the Senate's Justice Committee. Instead, he commented that what happened at the Senate showed that people were "eleak, inexplicable and unlawful."
"The only thing that could happen and the fine thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see the evil, when you see people who are angry, elekah, indiscriminate and dishonest," he said.
"You see the press messages and jokes and then they say, 'No, I haven't.
I haven't.'
Do You Remember?
Did you get it, Diane Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Did you light the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't let it go.'
Wait a minute.
'No, we haven't eaten anything,' he admitted, and imitated the senator.
The letter with details of Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and was released in September, but Feinstein refused to have come from her office.
"I haven't darked Ford's complaints, I haven't let her know," said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill newspaper.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wanted."
But her dementia does not seem to fit the President, who, during the Saturday evening meeting, commented: "I must say you are a thing; that was really a bad body language.
She may not have done it, but that was the worst language I've ever seen."
The President continues to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been charged with sexual abuse by three women, and he stated that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back the power with all the necessary resources.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run to get power and control," said the President, according to the digital news site Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two targets for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars sonated the loss of peace in Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received an early double lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were invited to the event before Dwyer re-established Belfast Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard welcomed Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen assured the winner.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season of Adam Keef's law, which came from behind and struck Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two laws, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening target came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assistance from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave assistance when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intensive first period, Sullivan brought the home painting back into the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquartt delivered it to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer saw that Belfast Giants was in the lead at the first break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The Home Hall regrouped and Bouchard once again tweeted with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, and he won the winning with his team's fifth half-way through the final period.
Belfast Giants, who now lost four of his last five matches, will play home against Milton Keynes at his next match on Friday.
However, pilots were able to fly hundreds of people on a plane from earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia is now rescued as a hero after he was born when he saw that a plan with hundreds of people on board could be lifted safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a great earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful retreats continue to plague the area and many are stuck in the bridge in the city of Palu.
But although his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agun left his post in the wildly waning control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the starting line, could be lifted safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was going to explode.
He was born in a hospital later.
The speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
"We arranged with a helicopter from Balikapan on Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
I'm sorry he got off this morning before the helicopter came to Palu.
We're overwhelmed to hear this," he said.
At the same time, the authorities allow the number of deaths to increase to over a thousand people. The disaster aid authority of the country says it is limited access to the cities of Doghara, Sig and Boutong.
"The number of deaths continues to increase because there are still many bodies remaining in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a speaker for the authorities.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes provide assistance and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with dead bodies.
It's bad about clean water.
The minimum markets are everywhere. "
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to meet there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo called on Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Indonesia was killed earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people were killed.
Aeroplane Krasch in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports now that a man is missing after a plane is broken into a law
The airline responsible for the plan that collapsed in a law in Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean now claims that a man is missing. It was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the deteriorating planet and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not answer exactly the questions of more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Lokala boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the planet sank into the water when it tried to land at the airport at Chuuköarna.
On Friday the officials announced that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and how the event appeared.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both reported that the planet landed in the lagoons without reaching the landing path.
Some Witnesses thought that the planet was passing through the countryside.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the planet flew into very low.
"It's extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others were able to make things through medium deep water to the needs of the sinking planet.
He said that the cabin crew got panicked and screaming, and that he got a little bit hurt.
The American fleet said that the seamen who worked near developing a shipyard also helped in rescue work by using a floating boat to drive people in the country before the planet sank in 30 meters deep.
Data from Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have been affected by accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea for the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analyticals draw up a line of time for the night when a woman burns alive
On Saturday, the complainant concluded his complaint in the second trial against a man charged with burning a woman in Mississippi living in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, spoke for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained for jury how he had used cell phones to put together the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements that night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location information from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night she died, which contradicted his previous claim, reported The Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the information showed that his cell phone was with Chamber's cell phone during the period he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in the place that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis about Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "laughing because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis once after Chambers' death radioed Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He kicked her out of her life," said Hale.
The defence is planned to launch its final launch on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that same day.
The High Width: What is the awareness of hipop?
A hipop-trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Width from Bristol seems to have gone far from its origin in political messages and to attack social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make the consciousness hippie popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently been released in Britain by such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
A black again?!
A child girl in New York agrees with a couple because of her commitment to a "racist" text message
A young girl in New York agrees with a couple of discriminatory commitments after she received a fake text message from modern, who complained that she was "a black again".
The couple refuse to be racist and compare the word "expression" to "expression".
Two-child uncle Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed frustration when she realized that the new girl Giselle Maurice was black when she came to her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN A SVART IGEN", wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a text to his husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice twice.
After she had realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "bad to the contrary", and gave Maurice the shock, and claimed that their former children, who were Africans, had done a bad job and that instead she expected a Filipino woman, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work and was sent home in taxi.
She now agrees to get compensation for the divorce. She seeks compensation in the size scheme $350 per day for her work from the start to work, which would be in six months and where she would live with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she said to New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple objected to the allegations that they would be racist and said that it was the only cancer to end Giselle Maurice's employment. They were worried that they could not trust her when they had abused her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said the owner Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you trust your children to someone you've been unchallenged against, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
It's serious."
Plasco compared the statement to "expression" and said that his wife would give birth to children two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Will you give yourself to such a person?
It is not particularly pleasantly done," the investment banker Plasco said.
The judicial process is still under way, but the general opinion has quickly condemned couples on social media and criticises them for their behaviour and rationality.
The Paddington audience didn't think the readers could relate to a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Paddington's author Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented: "It's hard to think about how it was for a person who first read it before it was delivered.
It's very fun, given what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She told her father, who had worked as a cameraman on BBC before he was inspired by a little toys boy to write the book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She allowed the 60-year-old jubilee of the first edition to be "biterly" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family" and allowed her father to be proud of his final success.
"He was pretty quiet of himself, and no one was funny," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds with something.
I think he saw Paddington's successes a little bit like that.
Even though it was his creation and his fantasy he always used Paddington himself."
My daughter was going to die, and I got to take a seat on the phone.
When she landed her daughter was taken to the hospital of Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors worked to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that you didn't expect her to be all right," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad who said she would die within two minutes and that I had to take care of her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my love.
I'll be right there.
I'm coming to you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly disappeared and left her body.
She had died right before and now everything was down.
I just got to sit there and wait and know that all of this happened.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to take me together."
Finally Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who now suffered the loss of her daughter, went on board the planet along with the other passengers, who were fully aware of the difficult test she was going through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I bowed my head down, and tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt a great feeling for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Surgeoning women set up cardboards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their lives in the face of suicide are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up a card on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and he took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to need to be as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney. She tells me her son was a promising cook who had a contagious laugh.
"Everyone knew who he was because of his laugh.
They said his smile lighted up the room."
But he stopped working before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his nephew when he took his life in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I'm worried about consequences all the time."
Sharon Davis created the card "for people to know that there are people who can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost his partner 15 years ago, Mark, some time after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she says.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that he was acting differently.
On Sunday he was on the floor. When the children opened his Christmas candles, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
She says his death was a very hard blow for them, but they have to take care of it. "It flows up a family wound.
It cuts us apart.
But we must continue to fight allihop."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI starts an investigation
"I thought if we could get something similar to what he asked about - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - then we might get some agreement," said Jeff Flake on the hearing day. He allowed him to fear that the committee would be "distributed" because of deep party differences.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their resistance depends entirely on the time.
The mid-year elections will take place only five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans make a bad choice, which is expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the one they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called the senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was a personal secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the death sentence and confirm his infiltration in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean miners "snakes" under Kim
The number of North Koreans hoping for South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, which cites data from the South Korea Reunification Ministry, says that 1,127 people have jumped from last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park says that more severe border controls between North Korea and China and higher human trafficking charges are important reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Finally, the majority of North Korean explorers are offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the flights across China, which have the longest border to North Korea and whose borders are easier to cross than the closely guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean States.
China sees the evictions as illegal migrants faster than refugees and often send them back with violence.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is still technically at war with each other, has been significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks focusing on the ongoing negotiations on nuclear weapons.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean peninsula to be free from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of failure since then.
"Without confidence in the United States there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we cannot at all defend ourselves unilaterally first," said Ri at a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh for "hysterical" and says he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
The Prime Minister of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was impatiently inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelois comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin in Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had been so busy, she would be called 'hysterical'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness target before the Senate's justice committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became sensitive when he rejected the charges of having given up Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when both were teenagers.
During his opening session, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, and then he screamed almost and the voice stuck when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the democracies of the committee and said that the charges against him were "grossed and co-ordinated murder" organized by Liberals who were afraid that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's witness objectives proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was a party to the heads of the Democrats.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi questioned whether she would try to place Kavanaugh before the law if he was attacked, and whether the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he is currently in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi allowed her as a Democrat to be concerned about what decision Kavanaugh might come to face against the Unfordable Care Act or the abortion of Roe vs. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In its confirmation questions, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not a position for a hysterical and party person to put himself in court and expect us all to complain," Pelosi said.
Women have to stand out.
It's a fair criticism, months and years of evil that cooks over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
And she continued: "I got the help of a woman who was VD somewhere. She said that she also cried when she was upset, but had developed a technique that meant that when she became angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: 'You might think I'm sorry because I cry.
I'm mad.'
And then she went on.
I thought it was bright."
The tears are allowed to get rid of anger partly because they are often misunderstood on the ground.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs at a man-dominated office, where I once cried out of unexplained love, was that I was taken into the power of an older woman. It was a quiet boss that I had always been a little scared for, and she dragged me into a trappus.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sorry and they're happy that they've been printed for you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught up in an uncompromising business on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason to investigate the idea of setting himself up in the presidential election.
"It wasn't a well-thinked decision," she said with a smile to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates. The last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it 'Snovit and the seven bears.'
Because she was late out, she fell behind the money collection, and promised not to go in as a candidate if she didn't get $2 million together.
It was a project doomed to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave her $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting fired?" she wondered.
When she announced in a speech that she would not launch a formal presidential campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and focus on voters faster than delegates, and contempt for sexism, that the vote was stocked.
"You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schröder recalls approaching the reactions of the press.
"You could have thought Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking, 'What are they gonna write on my gravestone?'
"She's crying?"
Why the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening of the trade war between the United States and China was urgent. The war is far from over, but the gap between the countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning committee earlier this year by placing important Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important increase came in the week, with new duties on goods for 200 billion dollars. This means in practice that half of all goods coming into the United States from China are charged.
Beijing has each time responded with the same coin. Recently, between five and ten percent of US goods for 60 billion dollars were spent on taxes.
China has promised to match the US's actions. The world's next largest economy will probably not fall down within a reasonable amount of time.
To get Washington back means to lie down for requirements, but to publicize for the United States would always be a genius for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing is playing its short rights, the press from the US trade war can provide a positive support to China in a long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"A fast political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in the entire country, and it is actually much more dangerous than the observers have previously agreed," says Abigail Grace, a research assistant focused on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria 'redo' for returning refugees, by Foreign Minister
Syria says the country is ready to accept voluntary return refugees and calls for help to build up the country, which is in ruins after more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are now being improved.
"The situation in place today is more stable and secure, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to build on the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
There are now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and well-being.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have moved to the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian support.
According to Al-Mouelem, the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the damaged country.
However, he stressed that it does not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that have supported it.
Europe with victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by winning Team USA with final score 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in line on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when Danish Captain Thomas Björn's team reached the 14.5 points required to hit the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was able to fight hard during most of the tournament, landed in the water at the 16th floor of the castle's 3rd floor, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari was glamorous in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever done 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was awarded 5 & 4 of the lowest ranked players in the European Act, Thorbjörn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have done his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who is a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the most successful European tournament ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't use crying, but today I can't help it.
It's been a nice year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad to win back the winner.
It's about the layer, and I'm glad I could be of help," said a voice after the European Parliament said.
He left over the staff pen to his countryman John Ram who defeated the American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
"What extraordinary pride, to get to fight Tiger Woods. I'm up looking at him," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four matches in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder Cup.
A special statistics for one of the world’s best players who has ever won 14 major titles, which has only been exceeded by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA fought all weekend to find fairway, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the fallout performance: "I am proud of these guys, they've fought.
It was tomorrow when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We were wrong.
The hate of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the U.S. PGA tour and our Ryder Cup Committee and then we're going on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be the captain.
You get booked and booked.
They played better than we."
General flowering: The stops decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Floridas Fisheries and Forest Commission shows a general reduction in the concentrations of algae flowering for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, there are no comparable flowers in the areas around the large municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier.
The alga flower stretches 20 miles from the coast, from north Pinellas to south Lee.
Flakes can be seen about one and a half miles out of the sea outside the large Hillsborough municipality, but in less places than last week.
Alga flowering has also been observed in the large municipality Pasco.
Medium-high concentrations in or outside the coast of Pinellas have been reported during the past week. Outside the Hillsborough coast is low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or outside the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium-high concentrations in or outside the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports on breathing irritation continue to come from the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in the northwestern Florida last week.
