Barack Obama will be the fourth US President receiving the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will come to Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth US President of history.
The diploma, medal and check of $1.4 million will be received, inter alia, through exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will come to the Black Metro in the morning and have much to do.
First, a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he will first meet with the five members of the committee who, in October, elected him between 172 and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then has a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the evening the visit will take place at a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious Gilead.
He will be the fourth president of the United States who receives it, although the third one who receives it in his role.
The White House has already announced that, after receiving the prize, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the prize as president of a country currently at war in two countries.
Their efforts in war increased further by sending additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of its critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, the diploma and check of ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to give them charitable paraffins, but has not yet decided which organization in particular.
During its entire programme, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which they will attend, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama had a more well-served attitude towards the prize from the start.
He mentioned, for example, the feeling that he should not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him but for all who struggle for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it was "a challenge to take action".
Defender of the accused nature of chanting

Last year he appealed several times against certain construction licensing procedures and in order to withdraw the appeals he demanded investors money for their own benefit, said the spokesman for the Litomérice police Alena Romová.
The President of the Society dedefensores de la nature Litomerírica is Lubomír Studnička.
Currently detained and faced with a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like the containers to separate the trash
In Prague, citizens can separate drinks packages and in the villages of South Moravia containers can be found to separate garbage everywhere.
And Brno?
There they need several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that Brno has nothing to do with the garbage.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, associations are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally delayed in the separation of garbage, not only because we, citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but especially because of the number of containers for these residues.
Have you ever tried, for example, to pull a PET bottle into the center to the appropriate container?
It is almost impossible, especially requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I've found so far is on the Moravské namestí square, in front of the Potrefena Huse.
That Mr. Onderka and his companions are not angry with me, but that seems too little to me.
There is no need to mention that in other parts it is not easy to separate the garbage either.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate it.
By Vagania
What happens is that containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to take away several bottles of glass and plastic.
But I didn't see any red container near the Kaunicova Street.
Fortunately, on my way to the tram I found the right place.
However, the trash has already been emptied of the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics don't seem to be too interested in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy you out of the city the hockey extract, which shames us all over the Republic, and do not buy any more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I'm glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little, with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM society, Brno is really the worst in the whole region of Jihomoravský Kraj.
Paroubek's budget took away money from pensions and sickness subsidies
After the left, in spite of the Government's opinion, funds may be added to farmers or officials, the budget may not have enough money for pensions, sickness subsidies or construction savings.
But neither is it for the interests of State debt or international disputes.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of the coming year, says Hacienda Minister Eduard Janata.
When social Democrats and Communists forced the increase for some groups, they were convinced that the government would demand a loan for sensitive, low-income or disease subsidies. "This only suggests to delay the problems for the future, it is to place mines," Janata says.
What happens is that when money is taken over, you have to pay higher interest rates and, someday, you have to return the money.
The State does not have many options to earn money.
If it does not reduce the social benefits or operating costs of the State, taxes must be increased.
To all who added to the left now: bombs, teachers, farmers.
And, later on, also to your children.
People don't have to worry about sickness benefits or subsidies, they'll get them.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; the next year will not only cost 163,000 million, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janato, debt will continue to increase along with the costs of interest.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer be able to increase VAT slightly or reduce maternity subsidies, as the government has done in its deficit package.
Due to the money transfers for some electoral groups, the coming year will also require five billion dollars to complete the construction of buses and railways.
These are, above all, sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their prices cannot be reduced.
The greatest thing you can do is save them, which is not free either.
This means a delay or termination of the thirty major buildings; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanselka.
ČSSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the ČEZ dividends, which is mostly State property, and it will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never certain nor is it about a fundless bag.
Last year ČEZ allocated 18 000 million to the budget.
Each year, dividends settle environmental damages, serve to complete the interest account or serve as a reserve for the preparation of interest reform.
In addition, this trend, according to EU rules, increases the actual budget deficit of 5.7% of GDP.
The Carnival of Money Transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were provided from the budget to grant various compensation to the victims of communism and crime, or for dispute costs, including construction savings.
It is unclear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose some international dispute, maybe we'll have to pay for it, Janato says.
The Minister will then have to save money within the resort or, at the worst of the cases, hand down the government's budget reserve.
There are also hundreds of millions already missing for the Statátní pokladna project (State Caja), whose price is 2 billion and which has already been started. It must be allowed to monitor online what different authorities are spending.
The first stage starts in January.
If the trade minister does not find the money on the other hand, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, warned Janato.
Your future smart phone can work with two operating systems
The United States will have a mobile phone where the user can switch between several operating systems by pressing a key.
The revealed plans sound promising.
With just one key click, they'll be in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
This option is precisely the goal of the U.S. company VMware, which focuses on developing virtualising software for computers.
On your mobile phone you can take two user profiles at once.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
The two are operating at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware company in the interview for the computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where the systems mentioned, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in its support.
The VMware company cooperates with European and US operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and these phones will be available to customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains concerns hotelers
Not only do the television operators in Krkonoše worry about snowless tracks.
The lack of snow makes people don't book ski stations in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Nochebuena and Nochevieja.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but they're still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they ask us about our opinion immediately, whether these Navidities will have snow or bar," said the holder of the Information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to pass on Špindlerův Mlyn a Nochevija according to their expectations should no longer doubt the stay.
Those who prefer to save the money and place the quality of accommodation in second place can try to wait a few more days.
Hotelers from Špindlerův Mlyn offer mainly weekly stays for Nochevija.
I think they'll continue to offer them, but soon they'll retire and offer shorter stations.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, he loved Jandura.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what matters most is the navigation week, which is still not complete.
Half of the places offered are still free.
That's why we've already prepared some last-minute navigating stations," Ingtours director Petr Schiefert said.
Vrchlaví travel agency can also offer Nochevija in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February are sold very well, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stations is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there's snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the snowless mountain.
If the tracks remain snowed during the week, Christmas dates will also be exhausted," Schiefert believes.
On the contrary, it's a little easier to take care of the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pec po Sněžkou; last year was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For the Night and Christmas, we have the latest free places.
The interest increases during Polish holidays in January and February is also well-selled," the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada, reported.
The eight percent of Nochevieja stations are also busy at the hotel Omnia, near the central parking area in Janské Lázné.
On the contrary, in the most recent hotel in Janské Lázné in Navidat half of the beds are still free.
This January was a great surprise for us, as we found about 60 percent of the employment capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as the snow falls, the interest in stations in Krkonoše will undoubtedly increase, said Erik Sparysch, director of the hotel Omnia.
However, it seems for a moment that Krkonoše hotels will experience snowwinners waiting for them.
Thursday should fall temperatures and, if there are precipitations, in the mountains should snow.
But then the temperatures will again rise, reported Jirí Jakubský de Hradec Králové, of the Institute of Hydrometeologics of the Czech Republic.
U.S.: The repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the most intelligent man, as a diligent student repeats on the issue the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the worst.
When he finally discovered his Afghan approach, eagerly expected, it proved to be a copy of the guide used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is used several times "as in Iraq", but it did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 declaration for its own statement: "A new way forward".
He was himself, three years ago, critical of Bush's idea of sending new military forces to Iraq, the country that is suffering from civil war, and that criticised him as "an irresponsible decision and with disastrous consequences".
The following months, however, demonstrated that Bush's strategy, based on field capital recommendations, was the only possible and successful one, so that nothing in the news is being said today.
Bush's reputation did not improve, however objectively left his successor a much more favourable initial situation than he could have expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama looks forward to the miracle.
The camp commanders again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander general of the Afghan operation Stanley McCristal. He, despite the traditional subordinate relations, subjected the indeterminate gunmen to a harsh criticism in the White House.
He asked 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president resigned for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so at least he cheated the general on 10,000 soldiers.
It was possible for Europe to promise it another 5,000, although it itself had previously counted at least 10,000.
The most problematic of all Obama's strategy seems to be its goal, to start withdrawing from Afghanistan's troops in 18 months and finalizing this procedure in three years. All Obama's doctrine generated more questions about the answers he offered.
Many doubt that the increase in fruit is the same as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fraternal wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, and its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to trust anyone and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces if they are used to change the boss every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will continue to be only a village of Potemkin, after which patriotial tribal relations will remain.
To balance the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complex due to confused relations, even more complex by the influence of Pakistani and Iran.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action", a minimum objective of all operations, it seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is shocked by its volunteerism.
For the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to stop.
Only a romantic soul, who doesn't know anything about the reality, can believe that the soldiers sent to the war to "come home soon," will do some miracles here.
From a political point of view, fixing the date of withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, since the Taliban will consider it an indirect declaration of the United States defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are increasingly willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians don't know, and they don't want to explain to their voters what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war against the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of having a radical impact on the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions do not have any effect on Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: to try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to find the answers exactly when, according to Obama, America begins the triunfal withdrawal of Afghan troops.
However, each solution will mean a dramatic review of the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that three years are missing for presidential elections and therefore there is still much time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
The Goldman Sachs bank guidelines will no longer receive the bonuses in effect
The high executives of the U.S. Goldman Sachs bank will not receive the bonus this year.
The entity announced it to react to the critical burden of its wage practices.
The group of 30 high directives shall receive, instead of money, shares which cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to the Reuters agency, Goldman Sachs became the leader in an effort to unite the bonuses in Wall Street with the power of long-term.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longer way to start, mentioned JPMorgan Douglas Elliott's former investor banker.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank faced the criticism after having separated almost $17,000 million (nearly CZK 300,000 million) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the Reuters agency, is probably over, despite today's announced measure of $20,000 million.
High bonuses in the banking sector became a delicate issue with the coming of the financial crisis.
Great Britain announced the Wednesdays that it planned to record once, with a tax of fifty per cent, the bonuses for bankers exceeding 25,000 pounds (about 712.000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prizes in all categories Less Physical
Five women, which is a record figure, today in Stockholm by King Carlos XVI Gustavo de Sweden, received the Nobel Prizes this year in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also a German author of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine received it from two U.S. biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his partner Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemical Nobel received it from the Israelis Ada Jonathan and the US Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz by explaining the structure and function of the rebels.
The last award, the Nobel Prize for Economics, was received by U.S. Elinor Ostrom and his partner Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a prized woman, was Physical.
This prize was received today by Charles Kao scientists for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis for all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each prized received the diploma, Nobel medal and the certificate of money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish crowns (about 25 million Czech crowns).
In the case of several prizes in each category, the prize is divided into one another.
The most traditionally expected Nobel, the Peace, received it this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the controversy of being awarded, as it was at the beginning of his career and was also at the head of a country participating in two wars: Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend its policy, however, it added that in certain situations wars are necessary to achieve peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janato sees the resignation. Klaus invited him to Castillo
President Václav Klaus will be given Friday morning to Minister of Agriculture Edward Janata, who is on his way to stay in the government, since he does not agree with the version of the state budget for the coming year, approves Wednesday by the House of Representatives.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps Janata's stay in the office, will be the subject of its Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
On the date, President Radim Ochvat's vote was announced.
Janato wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on his permanent role.
According to the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should manage with a deficit of 163,000 million dollars.
The House of Deputies, however, approved Wednesday proposals from the left for funds transfers and increased money for staff salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government does not agree with the proposals made by the social Democrats, as they cover a considerable increase in budgetary deficit.
Between the left and the government, Klaus and the right, there was a serious internal political conflict. Because of this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic office began to be challenged, which was agreed in spring by ODS, ČSSD and the Greens Party.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the House of Representatives, is actually liquidated by the package of conservation measures imposed by the Government of Fischer to bridge public debt.
Klaus may but not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he said during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians spent a lot of time behind "the serious problem", i.e. "the unsustainable deficit" of public procurement.
He says they don't have a good solution today.
Only a strong government, which can be supported in a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the President said.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek said that the budget was frightening and that the government should think about its future existence.
The Vice-President of ODS, Petr Nečas, told the ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is obviously no longer working.
First Minister Fischer responded and qualified for similar words of "strong judgements".
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is shocking, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek. It will exceed 200,000 million crowns.
Wednesday ČSSD said the adoption of the state budget for the coming year was successful.
People were also happy.
Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that Hollywood's new film, Invictus: Invincible, reports a lot about the country, its fight and its victories, although some critics say that the protagonists play American actors.
The story is about sports, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The powerful fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and his first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in his biography by the U.S. winner of an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91 years old, asked him to interpret it in Eastwood's film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "When I interpret it, I'll have to have access to You.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama on the world of boxing millions of dollars Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who ended up being a slave, of the U.S. presidential fiction, and even of God in Evan Almighty. But rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statist spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and has been president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Inventable is a Latin word and the title of an English author's poem William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined his forces with the head of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation continues to be racially and economically divided.
He believes he is able to join his people through sport, and so he decides to join the rugby players, who belong to the world's outsiders.
The South African team is able to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story to the movies.
I had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as real as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were outside the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to dinner with him, to be among the hostages before his speech.
The most important thing was I wanted to hold my hand to Mandela.
I discovered that when I opened my hand, I got your energy, it was transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to turn me into a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national team of rugby, in which white players dominated.
The actor said he had been six months to prepare for a role in the tough rupby world.
A great surprise for him was when he finally met with Pienaar for the first time in his home.
I remember calling at the door, he opened up and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was: "In the film I look much higher."
Despite obvious differences between the characters of actors and their real models, and under the management of Director Eastwood, Invictus: Invitus received positive reviews and also spoke of ambitions for Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summarized his evaluation with these words: "It was a very good story, a very good film."
In film reviews on the Rottentototoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent of positive evaluations.
The Secret of Splendor on Norway Resolved: Russians Tested a Missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Ministry of Defence of Russia concluded yesterday by acknowledging that near the borders with Norway proved an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The missile type "Bulava", previously intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the weight of the Russian generals and of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even its repeated presence in missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulva, in most cases, did not fly out or an air error occurred.
In Russian newspapers they write "Bulava" as "a missile that doesn't fly."
A mission he doesn't want, but it shines.
During this, the 13th test did not occur at first.
At the end of the flight, new technical problems were encountered on the device.
Probably the engine set up in the third phase of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated in the White Sea.
This type of missile enables launch from a ship that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
It is therefore likely that the mysterious light about Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failure "Bulava".
The same Norwegians from the first time did not vacillate that it was a Russian missile.
The generals defend themselves this time by claiming that they cannot simply speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile reached and the event occurred on the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately discovered in the first stage.
Although none of the fires were completely innocent, only six of them failed according to the Department of Defence's management.
The success of almost fifty percent full of optimism to the generals and therefore continues to say that "Bulva" will one day fly without problems and will even be able to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, with a maximum weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA in Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary Defender Viacheslav Fetisov will be presented at 51 years of age at a professional hockey meeting.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and winner of the Cup Stanley will help your team CSKA Moscow and will probably play Friday in KHL's misery against San Petersburg.
Fetisov completed his career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chaired the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash gets injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov practice constantly and has committed himself to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, quoted the AP agency to Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is still unclear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirit of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice tracks, it will become the longest professional player of the Russian hockey.
The front legendary Gordie Howe played in the NHL by Hartford at the age of 50 and a year, during the entire season, and achieved 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The largest group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful historical hockey players.
Playing by the Soviet Union won two Olympic gold, seven world champions, won in the Canadian Cup and the June World Championship.
In the second part of his career he also succeeded in the NHL: playing with Detroit won the Cup Stanley twice.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the hockey Glory Hall.
Hyundai has met the union requirements. It will cancel all additional work
The management of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with trade unions to cancel all the additional work.
Exactly because of the frequent extra work, the unions declared the moon emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The direction, however, wants to agree with the unions for this year a more Saturday tour.
We cannot refer to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed voluntary additional work on Saturday 19 December, namely, it will be working on two shifts, Vaněk said.
According to Sedmićka.cz server, the company offered 400 CZK bonus to employees working on the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vanjka, the company decided to change the way it motivated its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can cover the bonus for extra hours or take a day off on 28 December, i.e. prolonging the navigating parties one day, Vaněk mentioned.
In addition, all employees of Saturday shifts will receive money for travel and food.
Since the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of unionists and hostages who stopped manufacturing last week, the management decided to immediately cancel all the supplementary work for the month of December, Vaněk said.
The car factory employees were forced to work two hours more than eight hours and this situation was practically lost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, trade unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another trade between the factory management and trade unionists should be held on Monday morning.
The chief of trade unions, Petr Kucharí, said Wednesday, that if they are committed to meeting the requirements and sign the document, they are willing to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation in the car factory improved last Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously entered the strike due to frequent additional work.
They also protested against the poor conditions of payment and the alleged austerity.
The Board considered that employees had to work extra hours to meet the requirements and to be able to provide cars.
The unionists, in their statement of the moon strike emergency, also demanded that none of the employees, who had interrupted the production last Wednesday, be punished in some way.
With regard to supplementary work, trade unions require that the company minimize it.
In addition, this year requires a fee of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
The production in series began last November.
By last September it had produced approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance up to the 'emalled' HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new components capable of moderate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against anti-drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the composition is not so effective in a common variant of the virus, such as some medicines already available.
AIDS cannot be treated until now.
However, the lives of patients can be significantly extended by a combination of medicines that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely removed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, medicines will no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and Heidelberg University shows the possibility of controlling the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that substances called metalocarbons have an effect on the albumin, responsible for the spread of HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way different from all medicines used today and can therefore solve the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus albumin.
The metallocarbons have a single tridimensional structure: two polyhexagons composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are combined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A pathogenic and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the vital cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, HIV fractionation does not occur and adult and viral infections would not occur.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, explain scientists in a press release published by the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemicals at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the Scientific Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of iron (see table) are combined by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The effect of this series of anti-HIV protease agents was demonstrated, as well as its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarbons on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in the medicines used in clinical use, but do not lose its effect on resistant variants, where medicines often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, makes metallocarbons interesting for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Rézáčová, the head of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemicals and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
He's fighting for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he's defending himself.
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for the coming year is "absolute" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think about its future existence.
The ODS statements were marked by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say it's time for the analysis.
The Vice-President of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nechas, the prime minister has to decide whether he wants to support the minority in the House of Representatives, who is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his position with the help of the left-wing parliament.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the problem of public deficit is quite different, Nechas warned.
The House of Deputies adopted the budget for 2010, despite the amendments made by the left, by over 12 billion dollars.
The House of Deputies increased the money for government officials' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government rejected the ODS proposals, as the budget deficit had increased widely.
The Czech Republic should manage the deficit of 163 billion kroner.
ODS left the room before the vote and thus fulfilled the Government's wish that the revised budget would be better than a temporary budget.
Disillusionment and in utility
Hacienda Minister Eduard Janata spoke of despair and feelings of worthlessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government would reassess the current situation.
However, it is convinced that if Janato would seriously threaten with dissipation in the case of approval of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká television, Janota asked for a meeting with the prime minister.
He said, he's thinking about staying on the job.
The reason is its disappointment at the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against budgetary deficit, according to Nechas in the Government, there is nothing to do with the ČSSD appointments, which has caused changes in the budget.
The first Minister should also say clearly, if he will, if the camera approves other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to sickness subsidies, pensions, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by ODS are not guilty
This is the case with Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing wrong. Topolánek stressed in the U.S. text message.
He recalled that in several ministries there were people belonging to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Nechas stressed that if Fischer decides to re-sign the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of the public sector, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which is based on the majority on the left, which is currently in the House of Representatives".
However, it cannot be counted on the support and tolerance of ODS members.
I didn't think about that, when it was time, I would take care of it, told reporters in the House of Deputies Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government by the members of ODS.
First Minister Fischer attended a European Council meeting in Brussels in the evening.
ODS granted the Prime Minister's request
He once stressed that ODS would probably vote against the revised budget if the first Minister did not explicitly ask ODS Members to accept the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, responded to the question if ODS is not concerned about the absence of the head of the party in Parliament and the Czech Republic during the budget negotiations.
He didn't tell me my vote was missing.
At the time of the mandate, he knew that in the following months he was dealing with the fact that the camera of Members and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself responded.
According to the new CD train schedule, fewer trains will travel almost the same rates
České drahy (Checos Ferrocariles) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less fast and local trains and, on the contrary, strengthen some links.
The total length of traffic will be reduced by 2 per cent compared to today, after the new train schedule enters into force.
Most tariffs include the basic price and customer price will not change.
For example, the residents of the Ostravsko region will win more links to capital, and dragy for this line will add a pendoline career.
The direct train, on the other hand, won't travel back to Bratislava.
In the Prague line - Písek - České Budějovice will cycle less fast trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in road-planned transport is in the region of Hradec Králové, eight per cent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and around.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced only within a few days of the week.
One of the greatest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysa nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esco system, in the surrounding cities, is possible through the electrification of the Lysá nad Labem line in Milovice.
Long distance links to the capital will end at the Prague Hlavní nadraží station.
ČD will introduce more links SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will travel every two hours.
From December 13 the passengers will no longer travel to Bratislava in Pendolino.
This year's regional rail account: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport to cover the so-called loss of Drahy will receive the year that comes to up to four billion crowns in total, like this year. Local trains are charged by the regions, the year that comes to pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local trains dragy have a new ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been one year.
Drahy are happy with the system, and maybe that's why they didn't increase the prices of a large majority of tickets.
Changes will only be made in one day's tickets - ČD Net and in the cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For passengers with no customer card the price ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, so far there was the only price of 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.
Philippines's armed forces continue to arrest more than 50 people, children were released
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several students from a primary school and their teachers.
Thus the AFP agency, which previously reported only 65 kidnappings.
All 17 children arrested and a teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the Agusan province of the South.
They say that about 19 armed men use the reindeer as a living shield in the escape before the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining interest rates.
According to the AFP agency, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police previously persecuted the kidnappers because of violence, which led to the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maginanao was due to the recent murder, where 57 people died, the martial law imposed.
Among the victims of the death on 23 November, related to the governor's elections, were 30 journalists.
Suspected of the involvement in the killing, they arrested the governor of this province in the south of the Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential dynasty of the Ampatuans.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
However, on Tuesday they renewed the peace dialogue with the Philippines government.
The history of RSA refers to the whole world, says Morgan Freeman alliances Mandela
In the next few days, a new film from Hollywood, Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official title in Czech is Invictus: Neporageny), which captures part of the biography of former President Nelson Mandela of the South African Republic.
The role of the world-known fighter against apartheid is played by Morgan Freeman, whom he chose years ago for Mandela's own protagonist role.
The second role, the legendary champion in rugby Francoise Pienaar, played it by Matt Damon.
Externally the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Her full name is Nelson Rolihlahah Mandela. She was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for freedom of thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
great hopes, as they come to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa they are preparing for the World Football Championship. At the same time the media are shocked by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the population by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite many reservations against the distribution of prominent papers by Hollywood's "very interesting" stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he's proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the paper and prepared well for it.
Many times I met in person with Nelson Mandela, for - as it is said - to cover his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festival stranger in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the film we can remember Mandela's character and message.
It's a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it's all about the world, he added.
In the clothing of the national team of rugby
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It refers to South African Human Rights Lawyer during his first presidential period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of people, racially and for many years separated. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he is also a protagonist wearing the national team of rugby.
By entering the gram in the suit, which in RSA is considered to be almost sacred, Mandela achieved great ovaries 40 years ago, especially of the white public and the recognition of white people.
The football champion may be able to help people join and form a nation, said the rugby Chester Williams player, the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen if the situation improves tension in the RSA.
The white South Africans are, however, sceptical, as in a recent interview for LN a loved one of rugby Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
In Lounsko is a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire has caught a transformer from the company Čeps in a switch box near the village of Výškov in Lunsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the voice of the Ustí bombers, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Earlier the bombers wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, but later they changed their opinion and the fire was extinguishing it with a special mixture of water, foam and extinguisher material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the transformer's short circuit.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company's vote would have threatened the safe functioning of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is of several million crowns, counting it will not be possible exactly before the fire is closed.
According to Mandátová it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps' activity nothing like this happened, the averies of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the voice of the company ČEZ for the north Czech Republic, the supply of electricity was not cut, and the fire of electricity substation did not affect the functioning of homes, offices or companies.
A.s. Čeps was used in the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive holder of the distribution system, of 400 kV and 220 kV electrical conduction.
Stores in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the power of the transmission system to the distribution system, and maintains the electrical conduction of 4339 kilometers long.
Janchura will present a complaint per column to three Germans of ČSSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jancúra today will present a complaint by a complaint against three social Democrats.
This is Michel Hashek de la region Jihomoravský, Radko Martínek de Pardubikýkýký and el hetman de Olomowukýký country Martin Tesarík.
Jancúra mentioned it in 20 minutes on Radio Journey.
The demand must be seen in the company's efforts to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
However, all regions ended up signing long-term contracts with České Drahy.
All three topics are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking past pasta", but we only bring the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They say that we are dearer than České dragy, which is not true. We know the prices of České dragy, which were fixed last week.
So there's nothing left to defend us.
It's because of the dilemma towards the Student Agency company, said to Radio Jançura.
He mentioned that there was still evidence in all regions, and he said that they had not taken the necessary measures in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hashek considers this complaint to be the continuation of Mr Jancúra's media show, which serves as a free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my good reputation and the reputation of my region, and I call on the other topics that do so too.
I believe, which will also be clearly demonstrated on this occasion, that Mr Jancúra has been manipulating the public on the issue of regional rail transport, and uses false and false arguments, Hashek mentioned.
Janchura announced last week, which would invest several million crowns in advertising, whose objective would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
Radio Journey told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue after the new Year.
It was precisely that the campaign against corruption would be carried out as such.
Jancúra launched the campaign after the regions agreed with České Drahy to maintain regional rail links and for the purpose of approximately 150 billion crowns did not call for a tent.
According to Jancúra, similar steps are inconsistencies with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Janchura claims that she has been threatened by a ČSSD member because of her criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we didn't leave it, we could lose bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know what you are talking about, I am not going to say his name, Jancúra said today to RadioJournal.
The neumoccal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The neumoccal vaccine from January will end the usual customs.
As the first vaccine should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against neumococcals end up.
The Medicines Institute is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts have also made this clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January onwards, children born on 2 August of last year can receive the neumoccal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or earlier must also cover other doses of the vaccine.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth months of age of the child.
Last year the fourth part of the families voluntarily left their children to be vaccinated against neomococs.
However, parents paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
For vaccinating younger children, four doses are required.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend between 300 and 450 thousand crowns annually.
They will be stored without abrasion in treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
To date, the state has spent about 500 000 children annually.
The covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janata package.
The neurococococ is the cause of mediated otitis, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septaemia.
Of the neo-occal infections in our country each year, according to research in 28 hospitals, children under 10 years of age die.
In addition to Chequia, the neumoccal vaccine coverage in children was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
However, at the same time there are opinions that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The compulsory vaccine would be better, for example Rudolf Kalovský, head of the Nahals Civil Association.
Its association promotes neumoccal vaccines long ago.
Experts at an international conference, where our association participated, were not fully satisfied with the fact that we had the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the way we have to start now, Kalovský mentioned.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the vaccination procedure against neumocese.
At this point we don't think about it at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň said.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say
La Presidenta de la Sociedad de pediatras Professional company of practical child doctors Hana Cabrnoch’s recognition that the Vaccuna volunteer has su desvestjas.
If all children would receive the vaccine, they can be reasoned on the reduction in the number of doses. "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a high amount, we have relatively understanding the political decision to have initiated vaccination as a volunteer," Cabrnochová says.
Experts expect, that since the year that comes to more than 80 percent of young parents stop vaccinating against neomococcals to their babies.
The neumoccal vaccine is also a major change because since the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on the profile, to save later on treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy vaccines for themselves.
However, the pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, as when the state gave them other vaccines.
Some Members, however, were afraid that insurance companies could "take out the money from health insurance".
Doctors will therefore have to buy vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
Pediatrics are estimated to invest in the 40 000 vaccines per month, which is a significant sum.
It's not gonna be easy, Cabrnochová says.
The son of an American artist involved "in the theft of a museum"
The son of the famous North American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at US$ 20 million (12 million) from his father's museum.
The Pennsylvania police state that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while carrying 90 chairs in his vehicle and his trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his representation of such characters as Conan del Barbaro and Tarzán.
The news agency Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer said that a family dispute could have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta's 52-year-old son told the police that his father had ordered him "enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a warehouse".
The agency said Frazzetta's father refused to grant such permission.
The Labour Party defends the increase in taxation in the budget
Ministers have defended increased taxation and cost cuts in the previous report to the budget, in response to the criticism of opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling "lost" an opportunity to show his seriousness on the reduction of the deficit, delaying the decisions until after the elections.
The Hacienda Minister also received harsh criticisms to harm low- and medium-income workers.
Among its main proposals are an increase of 0.5% in social security expenditure and a peak of 1% in public sector wage agreements since 2011.
Color for Social Security
The unions have complained that low-paid workers are being punished with a recession generated by others, and have warned of future "problems".
The increase in social security expenditure, which will increase about three billion pounds per year, has forced the business community, which states that this is a tax on employment when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OF THE PROBLEM
Social security with an additional 0.5 % rise since April 2011
The economy will be more than 4.75% expected this year
New 50 % tax on bankers' bonds
The rise from 1 point of tax on small firms
Tax damages for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5%
According to estimates from the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns £30,000 will lose £90 per year and one who earns £40,000 will lose £ 190, while a person who earns £10,000 per year will earn £ 110.
The ministers said that their goal of reducing the deficit by half for 2013 was "hard decisions", but they stressed that 60 per cent of the additional taxes would fall over 5% of the highest wages.
The Hacienda Minister, Stephen Timms, denied that the taxable benefits and cuts of designated expenditure were a "land of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are large figures. It will allow us to reduce the deficit to half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," said the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party's forecasts of future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be paid and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance has been forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he said that the economy would probably be around 4.75% this year, much worse than the decrease of 3.5% predicted in April, while the claim for loans would be £3 billion above the previously estimated.
"Dismissed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the "debt crisis" of the labour force party, said that the proposed demand for loans for £789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, adding, "cinically" the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They haven't included anything significant about what they're gonna do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Hacienda, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and they have destroyed it."
"All major announcements will be made after the elections, whoever wins."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, in contrast to conservative proposals, which would seek to reduce the deficit in the shortest term.
But the Democrat liberals claimed that the money collected by tax increases and cost cuts would be used to support expenditure next year, not to reduce deficits, arguing that the projects were like "Arena castles".
The BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that the time chosen for the announcements, such as the increase in the inflation of certain subsidies due to the inability of the next month of April, mentioned earlier, would leave the Minister of Finance exposed to charges of electoral manoeuvres, as money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that the people most need it and will review the situation in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish the post-2011 expenditure data, economists said it was clear that the public spending adjustment would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said that the figures of the Minister of Science involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"This is really slowing down the pain for further," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All major ads will come after the election, whoever wins," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant of Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been the false report before the budget. The markets take account of this."
The FBI investigates "U.S. detentions in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating detention in Pakistan of five suspected U.S. men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. Embassy of Pakistan told the BBC that men were detained in a raid at a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, U.S.A., last month.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs said he was also looking for information on men.
It is reported that three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egypt's heritage and the other of Yemen's origin.
"If they are North American citizens, of course we are going to be very interested in the charges which have been held and in what circumstances are being held," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the detentions and was in contact with families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their business there, if they are actually the students who were missing," said the spokesman.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said men were arrested in a house belonging to one of them.
He said that the house was already in the presence of the local police and that there had been no charges against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the detentions, reported the Reuters news agency; but he said that the United States had to "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people".
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian "abuse"
Human rights in Iran have always been the same for the past 20 years, according to a report of the Amnesty International Campaign Group.
The report details "the models of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said they had hit him and burned him with cigarettes, another said they threatened him with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights history.
Officials have said such criticisms have a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad provoked major street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Twelve persons have been convicted, and the prosecutors state that at least five persons have been sentenced to death.
The BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Jamei, recognized some abuse charges, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance to criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report by Ibrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the outcome of the elections.
"They often hit me in the face," according to his words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under their eyes, in their neck, their head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and they left him and left him on the street, still bleeding and semiconscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters arrested after the election had been tortured until death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials rejected the allegations of rape, but admitted that there were abuses.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of an ex-inmate, who claimed that he had been detained in a container along with 75 others for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate the malaise of the post-election and government response, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confused and the adjournment of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski track was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn an interest site from Bristol into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for prizes in practice.
On the top of the pendant in Brandon Hill's park there was a short jump edge, facing a 100-metre track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that he had a beautiful view from the top of the track, but that was rather scary.
A beautiful view of the city's lights is shown below.
Here are some of the best snowboarders and snowboarders in the county, real talent," he added.
The prizes were awarded to the best tricks or manoeuvres performed on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will be stopped.
They're still with us.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a Laico State.
At a time when Swiss voters have requested that miners be banned and there is a general warning about the alleged Islam of Europe, John Bowen, a North American academic, has written a detailed and study report on possible integration of Muslims (which are actually being integrated) into one of the most open-ended societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the last work of the author "Why the French don't like their eyes" (2006) (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that has divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and its effects are still being realized today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
It's been months in blends, schools and institutions that now provide 5-6 million Muslims from France what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who plays discussions between teachers and students on questions that are of interest to them.
Should a Muslim marry in a blend or in a union (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it lawful for a Muslim to use a banking system based on interests to get a mortgage?
These are seemingly global issues, they support, things of everyday life, which concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of which are famous, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim academic and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open up the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern lay society.
They cannot fully disseminate this argument.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen tend to disagree with his counterparts in Salafi, party of Puritan Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French laity could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It asks how far the French political strategies (and the intellectual elite which so strongly defend layism) are actually committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims may have a more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments with lay republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it understands "a value adjustment".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say, "Yes, but not yet."
The world's most dissolute panorama
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramaticly than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is shrinking at alarming speed, bringing with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fisheries have recently been focused on open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, describes a natural history of the North icon, the polar bear.
Aware of the complicated history and policy of the whale hunt, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave valuable evidence facing the white bear.
The encounter of the charming Nelson as a valuable 14-year-old chain, struggling only with the extremes of his mosque, is certainly a myth, but others are real.
The animals, captured while following the bodies of their mothers recently disappeared, were arrested and sent to zoologists and circuses.
A round presentation at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even at present, zoologists are still generally a millionth of the area of a wild adult. The climate is almost never suitable: a polar bear living in Singapore is green by algae growing within the areas without its leaves.

Ellis refers to other writers and historians, and often goes back to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although it is prohibited in Norway, the United States and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and skiming Indians use high-power rifles to break their grips.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, an ancient editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and comprehensive account of the science of the Arctic and a supercoding view of how the future can be transformed from that place.
It's not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It's not because of a lack of commitment.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century gave indications for the first time about the movement of ice masses.
Then the submarines of the cold war drew a map of the moving ice corridors that circled under the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of probes mounted in the Icebergs are a useful supplement, but individuals in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looked inside the extraordinary, low world of the floating system within the Arctic ice, formed by salin water leaks that are compressed while freezing.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all condemned once the summer ice is removed, which is believed to occur at some point between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us.
Marines among the 6,000 who place crowns in Arlington's graves
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to put one crown in the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, N.C., to the Arlington National Cemetery for the decoration of drums, it was a day to honor men and women who once were standing on their boats.
In a few months, from where they're aboard us, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we are ourselves, I would like someone to do the same for me, so just try to show respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who met on Saturday morning to place crowns in the tombs of the veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morris Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Coronas Company in Harrington, Maine, began the event when he and other people decided to rent several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already a 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen travel every year standing in different cities along the road, to perform events dedicated to military and terrorist victims.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Cross America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the tombs of the Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, tombs at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Batteries Park in New York City and at the memorial site by Flight 93 of United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation provided more than $150,000 to buy and transport crowns.
Charlein Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said he traveled to Arlington in honor of his husband, a military career failure.
While her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was her way of paying compensation to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Surrounded by warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the wide beaches and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers directed to older graves of World War I, World War II, and Vietnam's war, because they did not receive as many visits as new graves, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was happy while the children were playing and the couple were taken by hand, while they carried the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red beam attached to the top.
Nearly there, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Military Association) provided 1,000 crowns to adorn the section, but the shadow atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the cold air.
Some read in high voice names carved on the stones, while others turned around to see small white plates and blacks placed inside the painted bar, for those whose stones have not yet been filled.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who suffered tears from her eyes in front of her son's grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of the sailor Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. My son paid for it, he said.
"Very much after my death I want someone to remember it."
Cuban officials arrested a US government contractor
The Cuban Government has arrested a US government contractor who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, the officials of the State Department said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works in customer projects such as the United States International Development Agency and the World Bank.
Consular officials along with the United States Interests Section in La Habana are seeking access to the prisoner, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be detained for almost anything that is considered "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, are at risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an initial blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and treated by government officials.
Sánchez has requested permission on several occasions to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permit has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor may probably cause tensions between the Communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a "low pace" approach to improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to get to know the news of the arrest Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban Government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be mutual agreement between the United States.
Mobile phones and laptop computers are legal in Cuba, although they are new products and coded in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban Government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are used especially for text messages, since a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors from the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of a U.S. in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the United States Interests Section in La Habana, said that most of the U.S. citizens' imprisonment in Cuba is between crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she couldn't provide more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly distracted.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as to distribute free mobile phones in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program of the American Human Rights Watch organization, recently published a severe report on freedom in Cuba, called "New Castro, itself Cuba", a reference to Raúl Castro's position as country's leader, to replace his older brother Fidel's illness.
Vivanco said that the defendants are often detained, processed and imprisoned in one day.
He pointed out that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban Government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just when both countries start having more dialogue.
Pakistani officials design a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five North Virginia men to Afghanistan to kill American troops, expressing their hope that the case could help to draw up a network of terrorists recruiters, who are using the Internet in search of radicalized young people.
The researchers said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them had made comments by approving terrorist attacks on the Internet YouTube video site.
Saifullah addressed men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal settlement, which is a family place for Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed about the case revealed on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince Qaeda's commanders that men were not part of a CIA complex to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargotha, far from the imposing mountains of the northeast, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covered operation.
For this reason they were rejected, the officer said that he had spoken since the anonymity of the case.
The officer said that men had not moved and were even trying to obtain the appropriate approval to access the Qaeda camps when the Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI underlines the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who are trusted.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, U.S. intelligence has been a major priority in attempting to infiltrate people within Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters act as guards, not letting those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who may be spies.
Analysts said that Qaeda was paying particular attention to the aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, due to their potential to have access to U.S. goals and their value of propaganda.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation based on the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who accept it, as U.S. intelligence agencies have been trained in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the recruitment model than so many have already followed? Kohlmann expressed.
It has been transformed into a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding climate action
The Saturday tens of thousands of protesters walked here on the streets requiring negotiators working at the City Convention Centre, which is more efficient for the climate.
The protesters said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police thought the number was close to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the center of the city.
On a day when little happened in the discussions on the environment sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists walked through the city holding posters in English saying "There's no planet B" and one in Spanish saying, "The Earth says "yes".
Several famous people joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the country of her mother's birth, made me aware of the stressful issues with which the country should deal with due to the impacts of the climate change that are already taking place."
This is part of the reason I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and call on the world's leaders, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement.
This isn't an easy task, but it has to be done, there's no way to push it out for more time.
The police prevented demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or because they were carrying pockets.
According to the Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who was asked not to be identified because he was involved in climate discussions, activists with sports masks and black activists placed several explosives near the main Copenhagen channel, which is close to several ministries.
They were about the buildings, he said, adding that they started as calls, but that they were followed by "a couple of great explosions."
Within the convention centre, people gathered around television screens to watch the march all morning.
But the protest did not seem to enter into the conscience of key officials like Su Wei, China's head of climate negotiations.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "It really wasn't so much in the situation".
Then he went on to say in mandarin, "As the meeting place is large, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depended on the perspective of each individual to determine whether the course was harmful or beneficial.
He said that this showed public attention in general and from different sectors to climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that negotiations, or the freedom of other peoples, affect negotiations.
Test data reveal persistent racial differences
The federal textbook of qualifications last week on the performance in mathematics was a very good news for the public schools of the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the systems with better performance of the country, the qualification book showed that the four- and eight-grade students have given up a faster pace in the last two years, with respect to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Assessment of Education Progress is the persistent difference in performance between Afro-American students and white students at both local and national level.
The average score of the fourth grade white students in D.C. over the last two years grew from 262 to 270 (a scale of 500), but their African parents increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance difference increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Afro-Americans of the eighth grade remained essentially stable, reducing a statistically significant point from 245 to 244.
The average white score was not included in the results of the test because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the table is no longer encouraging.
The difference between white and black students in 2003 when the first ENPE was introduced in the District was 60 points from the scale (262 to 202).
Although the score of children in both groups has increased during this period, the difference has only decreased to 58.
Some District Education Lawyers expressed concern last week, as the progress made by Director Michelle A. The Rhee and mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrata) were moved in a large part by white students who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by dealing with those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, has shown a non-profit organization that advocates educational equity in the District.
I am not giving leaps of joy for a difference of two or three points, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-For accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an asidian critic of the Rhee administration style, said that the message of the test scores is that secondary schools in the city have an desperate need for attention .
Of course they always want to see positive signs, and I respect them.
But what concerns us is that we are not devoting either the time or the energy needed for our high school.
Rhee said that the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This autumn, for example, is training some teachers to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, directed to students of higher grades of primary and secondary school, who did not dominate early reading bases in their school courses and are considerably behind their parents.
The mathematics of every day, a curriculum of mathematics from Kindergarten to sixth degree, which emphasizes games and experiences of real life, which were introduced into the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, to which he is credited with some of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the level, Rhee said.
Others say that the results of the ENPE highlighted whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and even provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
Here is a sort of disappointed dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studied urban testing points.
The solution to conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the objective can generate political impacts that are countering that important timetable.
But the problem is, of course, that, like other urban superintendents, she is trying to stick to the medium white and black class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now head of Newark's schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the performance difference is to extend the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the power of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his professors' union last year in a year of 185 days, which he considered to be a "indicator" to seek greater increase in the next convention.
Make higher education a part of the future
The tourist bus came to the University of Gettysburg with a strong resolution.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, went down and separated for a while before the white columns, the brick façade and the esmeral plates.
Graciela's parents had only graduated from a secondary school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never laid a foot in a university campus.
Still, when she and other eight-grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where the matrix cost $38.690 a year, her attitude was less impressed than that of potential enthusiastic students.
Yes! Here's where I'm going to be! Graciela exclaimed, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Carey, seriously?, said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the low proportion of teachers and students at school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children had visited on their three-day journey, and had already absorbed their completely deliberated message: The question is not whether you're going to university.
The question is what.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who leave secondary school or are pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who have access to university education that they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one out of five of these "second generation" Spaniards graduated from college, a remarkable achievement since many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing secondary school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they point out the way to a generation that will play a major role in the country's labour force.
Those who analyze higher performances say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of family ties with U.S. schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to get to university, especially if efforts are sustained in time.
Noting children with low incomes whose parents do not have experience and skills to help them navigate through the system, it is concluded that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We have to think about providing a support network for these children, from the children's garden to secondary school.
The federal program that funded the tour by the universities of Graciela is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than US$300 million per year to local school systems to run university training programs, which start when low-income students are in high school and continue to finish high school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent attending university, according to the United States Department of Education.
The Iraqi Petroleum Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns of violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild their fragile infrastructure during two substations that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in the restoration of the oil industry in Iraq, which has been munited by decades of war and sanctions.
The U.S. companies had left off having been raised in only two of the 10 substations.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second substation, which began Friday.
The only one that presented an offer was lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for forced evictions in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of US companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, says Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Petroleum Forum, an online news centre.
It'll take a long time before something else is available in Iraq.
Concerns about security, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability while U.S. military withdrawals were taking place, probably prevented U.S. oil companies from risking more energy in Iraq, which has the third most important reserve of world power, the analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some disadvantages, because rivals, in particular Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Western Petroleum Inc were the only American companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The main US firms, such as Chevron and ConcoPhillips, who have attached ties to the Iraqi Petroleum Ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years, have left with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the state of China, offered more contracts than any other company and achieved large investments in contracts for two main auctions.
We know that China is on its way to become a major economic and technological power, expressed the voice of the Ministry of Petroleum Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on the side of its competitors and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
The companies selected to submit proposals made bids that were then faced with the barrier subsidy that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels in each row.
Qaeda's main planner has apparently been murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that a alleged U.S. missile attack on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan has killed a major Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second death attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this autumn.
Saleh al-Somalí was one of the two Arab men who was thought to have fallen on Tuesday when a couple of missiles attacked his car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of Waziristan of the North, according to United States sources and Pakistani officials of the region.
Local authorities said that missiles were launched by an unknown aircraft of the type operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal zone of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, towards the Afghan border, when the car received the impact, said an official of Pakistan's civil intelligence agency, speaking by telephone from Miran Shah.
The officer said that the suspected local military were precipitated and quickly confiscated what remained of the "completely destroyed bodies."
The local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited unspecific evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia was described as a high-level military planner from Qaeda, who directed the operations of the terrorist group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was dedicated to conspiracy around the world, said a high official, who spoke from the anonymity, citing the delicate nature of American air attacks within the Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspirator attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic direction of the command superior to Qaeda and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somalia had climbed rapidly on the lines of Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a name known to some Americans, but it does not at all reduce the threat it posed to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second leader of Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a military force in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The rate of non-piloted aircraft attacks directed by the CIA has declined since summer, from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to a report from The Long War Journal, a website directed by a non-profit organization.
The reduction may be due to an improved approach by terrorist groups, which have taken measures to limit their vulnerability while killing suspected informants, the site said.
UN maximum sent to Kabul to cancel
The largest United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would give up his post in March, ending with a
Eide's exit occurs when Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional US troops to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said it supported the increase, but he was concerned that the U.S. military withdrawal schedule, which began in 18 months, had moved other NATO Governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the correct signal to Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also impressed the United States and other military authorities to increase the number of international civilian personnel working with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civil sector, he said.
Eide said he was not allowing, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said I wanted to report to the Secretary.
United Nations General Ban Ki-moon, so it would have been time to find a replacement.
What I said is that it's better that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month void between my predecessor's exit and my arrival.
Ban has begun looking for a replacement, according to United Nations officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently headed the United Nations mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously conducted United Nations peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was presented before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide rejected the crimes, but said Galbraith's allegations, which were rejected, "was certainly damaged by the mission, because there was already much skepticalness about international interference" in the election.
Eide said that I proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by United States forces in Afghanistan.
It also encouraged the leadership of the United Nations to allow its successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, which are committed to the Afghan mission, stating that this would increase their confidence in the correct use of their money.
Eide expressed frustration at his limitations to his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the strict regulations of United Nations contraction reduced his ability to capture talents.
That is how the United Nations rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and can't go on.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Defence Secretary, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its failure to engage in discussions on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, headed to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week's journey to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to him in view of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, I believe, in response to a soldier's question about the probability of such an event.
One of the things that weighs me is that if we've learned something from Iraq over the last six years, it's the inherent impartiality of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates pointed out that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
I argued that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and incentives", "to convince the Iranian government that they would be really less safe with nuclear weapons", because "their people will suffer enormously" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face "liquidable" consequences if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the United Nations Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran will insist on developing nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would renegotiate on the restriction of his nuclear programme and accept to leave a substantial part of his rich uranium reserve instead of the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has stressed this agreement as a way of building confidence between the two parties and making time for negotiations.
Since then, however, Iran has seemed to have withdrawn from the pilot agreements, in part, experts have said, because Iran's mandate is divided over the possibility of undertaking with the United States.
France, I believe that Iran's strengthening with the international community on some of the proposals that were actually accepted at the beginning of October has joined the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way that has not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline on 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, before other options are reconsidered, even to continue with what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "dangerous sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran ' s mission to the United Nations denounced what the United Nations had called Thursday ' s ' infamous and baseless allegations ' by some members of the Security Council on Iran ' s nuclear activities, and said that it was willing to continue the discussions with the United States and five other world powers, 'in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution'.
Gates, who was returning to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to Iraq's rich oil-rich region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions remain high between Iraq's Kurds and the Arab majority, in particular with regard to borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in United States projects, to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. US officials quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve its security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We won't leave them."
In a Chinese age, a change of route
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that they spoke to them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "a baby more means a more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when government officials in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and the elderly population of their city, suddenly changed their way this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was immediate and firm: No way.
We have given it all our time and energy for a child only.
There's nothing left for a second, Wang said at the age of 31, a human resources administrator with an 8-month-old child.
More than 30 years after the policy of a single child was introduced in China, creating two generations of well-known children, single children who were badly abused by "small emperors", a demographic crisis is developing in the country.
The average birth rate has dropped by 1.8 children per couple compared to the six since the policy was effective, according to the Division.
United Nations demographics, while the population of 60 years of age is expected to operate from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent by 2050, which is far above the global average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is worse in the rich coastal cities with very cult populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and more account for almost 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Committee on Family Planning and Municipal Population in Shanghai, has shown that fertility couples should have babies to "help to reduce the proportion of the elderly and reduce a future shortage of labour."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
As amended in the country's constitution in 1978, the policy of a single child of China may be the most polarized mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who break the policy face enormous losses, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have resorted to policy for their contribution to avoid a critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of policies.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortion.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to an unnatural proportion of male and female.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually adopted their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, more exceptions were made to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 many of their strong lines were removed.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the University of Beijing Institute of Demographic Research, said that central government officials have recently been discussing more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost in the morning, the letters that ordered families to have one child were replaced by copies of regulations that detailed who would be appropriate to have a second child and how to ask for permission.
The city government sent family and volunteer planning officials to visit couples in their homes and to dispose of booklets under the doors.
He has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the answer has been very unlikely.
Disappointing Response
Although rural city officials in Shanghai's suburbs support having observed a moderate increase in the demands of couples who want a second child after the campaign is launched, most urban districts have no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five requests per month.
Disappointment officials in Shanghai say that despite the campaign, it is still expected that the number of births in the city in 2010 is only about 165,000, slightly higher than 2009, but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee of the municipality of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people no longer want children.
They want to give him the best for his first child, he said.
Young Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, of 26, said that they would like to have two children and are legally enabled to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only the medical and life insurance that the government provides.
Without a social protection network, they maintain that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West wrongly see the policy of a single child as a matter of rights, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant for seven months of the first child of the couple.
Yes, they're stealing the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said that he wanted a single child because she was also: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to caring for others and we really do not want to care for others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, owner of a translation agency, explained it more satisfactorily.
For parents with two careers, of the middle class, who reduce the birth index, he said, it is about having enough success as self-esteem.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up to see their parents fight during the first days of China's experiment with capitalism and they didn't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from parents, I maintained.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "They have to remodel their apartment", and the strategy "You have to have a curriculum prepared for the best guards when the child has 9 months."
Most of your friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he showed.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A United Nations group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN climate conference, which has so far been characterized by challenging positions and mutual crimes, has caught renewed attention on Friday with the publication of a document that provides for ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the load on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the path to follow.
But it was seen as an important step in a negotiations that are being held without time, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Ad hoc working group of the United Nations would not talk about how much money the rich countries would give to the poor to face global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their carbon production, and what would be the limit of the global increase in temperature that political strategies would be willing to tolerate.
This gives you a lot of flexibility in the process, said John Coeqyt, High Representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who published the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the United Nations climate official Yvo de Bóer described as "the great panorama."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions for 2020 between 25 and 45 per cent, compared with 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged talks on Friday, promising to provide $3,600 million per year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and drought to deforestation.
In any way, Friday presented the same type of verbal artificial fires that have dominated the conversations last week.
The United States special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected the claims that require mandatory greenhouse gas emissions cuts for industrialized countries, compared with the volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The manoeuvre indicated that Obama administration is adopting a more difficult line with China, as regards what the Bush administration officials did only two years ago.
The United States is not going to make an agreement without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Foreign Minister He Yafei said that the largest US climate negotiator lacked "common sense", or "very irresponsible" because he had said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically to cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers in play, failure lines have been broken both within the world on development routes, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most valid action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegation from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the main powers are discussing who should spend on reducing greenhouse gases, even when vulnerable countries have become more aggressive seeking to contain large-scale emissions from their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, supported by Ulate, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of the most vulnerable countries to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants said that talks would produce a political agreement at the top.
The Small Island States Alliance, which has 43 members, developed a preliminary draft treaty proposal of 24 pages early in the morning.
Arthur Runge-Mitzger, who is head of international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of small island nations has "put political pressure on the whole political process," in part because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies, such as China and India.
The discussions took place in a new emergency while delegates focused on the fact that most of the exceptional issues had to be resolved before the heads of government were able to conclude a treaty.
High-level officials, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, descended from the planes and ran to Bella Center's passports, to meetings at closed doors and press conferences, in order to limit complaints that would be arbitrated during the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where 13,000 people enter and leave the convention centre every day), activists playing guitar present night shows burning from the countries they are selling, and preliminary hand proposals are made instead of e-mail), is a challenge.
The intensity is only built: almost all key ministers are here at this time, and Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering larger links, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice-president for the global policy of International Conservation.
The weights are coming.
The first train to 225 km from Great Britain redefines that feeling of the moon
At 5.13 a.m. in the morning, a silhouette will cause darkness to mark a train exit that marks a revolution for the journeys in Great Britain.
The first high-speed interurban train from the country will reach 225 km, when it passes as a radio from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
At Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, will then join Lady Kelly Holmes, on board the first Interurban Service Javalin outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Great Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great intersections of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected areas would be transformed into prosperous suburbans, business travel times would be shorter and the change in aircraft and railway cars would reduce national carbon emissions, as well as alleviate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of thousands of millions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fear of environmental damage can still shake the high-speed lines of Great Britain.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company established in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will submit its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed route schedule from the next scheduled stage for the high-speed network.
The new line that a London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where environmental impact can be polarized.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-metre radius of a final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will set up three options for a higher speed network which runs north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred option that is being proposed is an Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Peninos to Manchester and Scotland, and another towards the north to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle up to Tyne.
A single line would go into Scotland.
"It seems this will be the most useful option," said a member of the railway.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with a little more than one hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel 402 km, turning the British network into Europe's fastest.
The initial road is being designed to support 400 mt long trains capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal would be needed to receive 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the restrictions on capital space, an existing station is expected to be expanded to fit the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts believe that only St Pancras International or Euston station offers this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes that the scheme should take place, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until after a general election.
Even if the work is started, the network would have to be built into sections.
At first, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines by the trains in northern Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland more than three hours.
This is considered to be the crucial point for ensuring a change of aircraft to trains, a point of reference for the railway revolution.
Contributors face the mortgage for a £75,000 naranal of a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the voter of the Conservative Party, contributed thousands of pounds per year for the cost of a orange that he built at the home of his electoral district.
The party's prison vote, which was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the MPs lived "of reason", increased their mortgage by £75.000 to build a stolen extension in their second home in Rutland.
The contributor was allowed to charge additional interest, taking hundreds of pounds per month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the applications at their time and were not consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducted a review of the costs of members. Mr. Duncan said last night that the applications "could not be clearer or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owned a two-room house in a village in the electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The floor below includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the honorary office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a winter afternoon to the house, described in the plans as a "naranjal".
Neighbors described it as "a winter entertainment. "
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan during a recent investigation by the Committee on the Status and Privileges of the House of Commons on its previous mortgage agreements.
Last month, the committee ruled that it had violated the rules after an investigation of its costs.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of 271,406 pounds of his London property at the house of his electoral district, which he had purchased in 1991, the previous year to become a Member.
The documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately 1,400 pounds per month in mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, its applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
The interest rate of Mr. Duncan's Royal Bank in Scotland's mortgage did not change at that time, suggesting that the entire increase would finance the loan of 75,000 pounds.
The standard variable hypothetical type of BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March of this year, which is now present.
The latest document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for £1.250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as president of the opposition of the Chamber in September, after a covert reporter filmed it saying that the MPs had to survive "reasons" after the cost scandal.
" Basically this is nationalized, you have to live with reason and be treated as m**rda."
He said: "I spend my money on my garden and ask for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask a lot more, but I don't."
The Member, a millionaire for his former occupation as a oil merchant, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when he found that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this "may be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the form of the symbol of the esterine book in Mr. Duncan's cessepé as a protest, after he found out that he had requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in mortgage, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for primary improvements, approved both by the salary office and later by Legg."
He added: "It is not a matter of delinquency and delinquency or infringing the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It could not be in any way clearer or simpler."
Come to those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Brighton's Palament of the Beach
The Brighton Palaces have found a new impetus for winter months in an interactive event calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to adorn their palapas for each day of December, using villas as their theme.
The event began on 1 December, with guests who could see the last palpa from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with filled pastels and free serving ponche.
The selected villas so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La First Christmas, where the palpa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unremunerated clergyman from the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be more relevant to people in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we expect us as the Church that people come to an old foreign building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the calendar of the Palapa event began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent it through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and the whole world
Tens of thousands of demonstrators protested this Saturday in protesting an ambitious and binding agreement to combat global warming, in all the world and in Copenhagen, where the police stopped several hundred people.
Some thirty thousand persons, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, were deployed by the Danish cold capital in response to an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach its end by Friday, 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing climate mobilization worldwide, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents took place shortly after the beginning of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all black clothes, broke escapes with adoquins and martillos, reported an AFP journalist.
The anti-disturbation police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of between 600 and 700 people in total, according to it, particularly members of the "Black Blocks" groups that had already been active during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, East France, in April last.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of soldiers were detained "without distinction" and underlined that one hundred of them "were mobilized on the street on Saturday night married and sitting in spite of the intense cold".
The demonstration, quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and took to the Beautiful Center, the seat of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the invited speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cabo City, Desmond Tutu, headed a guard with candles.
Most of the protesters came by car and train from the great European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Korean, were also present as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with celestial showers responded by setting up a first concentration for the morning in Copenhagen on the call of Earth's Friends to form "blue seas" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explains Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino soldier at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep saying: There's a time, said the Belgian singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, water courses for which you can walk as never before could have been done.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, established in 1992, with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the anti-globalization movement was close to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that I came to Copenhagen to "unify climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight by another world".
The Pacific region, which collects many very vulnerable islands in the heat, gave the initial score at the exhibitions.
According to the organizers, some 50,000 people went off the road to Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, in most of their students, wore red clothes and lighting panels with sticks for solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, there were concentrations of hundreds of protesters who claimed to act energetically against climate change.
In France, the "350" network organized demonstrations gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marsella (South), Lille (Northern), Burdeos (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
Abkhazia separatist elected president, although Georgia claims "fraud"
This Saturday Abjasia, a Persian separatist region of Georgia recognised by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi claims "fraud".
Some 131,000 persons were invited to participate in the first post-Russia-Georgia war in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The electoral table closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to the officers of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, participation was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on Saturday night on Sunday.
The five career candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which rejected the extraterrestrial vote.
These elections are a façade.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, "laughs that Abjasia has fallen under the total Russian occupation," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considered it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia tried to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new state of independence, declared to AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who said he had voted in Bagapch.
She was among the voters who led to the electoral table at a school in the capital, Soukhumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with substantial landscapes on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large tables show Bagapch next to the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, West of the country, the district head, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed Russian officials who came to control the development of Scrutinium.
In a short ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, are grateful for the support of Moscow, and in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that his country will be rapidly recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered by raising his vodka vessel.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as those granted to Russia by the 10-year railway control.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims that he does not support the current power or opposition.
A majority of 50% more vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be held two weeks later.
Climate: World events, events in Copenhagen
On Saturday tens of thousands of people went out the streets of the world to plead for an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Conference on Climate Change, where the police, on alert, stopped more than 700 people around an unprecedented demonstration.
Some thirty thousand persons, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, died late in the cold of the Danish capital, which was hosted by delegates from 193 countries by 18 December in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, came from Parliament and took us to the Beautiful Center, where negotiations are under way.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center without trying to get in.
A stage was set up to welcome the invited speakers. The former South African Archbishop of Cabo City, Desmond Tutu, headed a guard with candles.
A few moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all black clothes, broke away with latrines and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The anti-disturbation police quickly circled them and intervened firmly, pulling them to the floor to several of them.
The police announced the arrest of between 600 and 700 persons, mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultraviolet groups that had already taken place at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, East France, in April last.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the mandible with an adoquin, and four cars were burned near a house occupied during the incidents that led to arrests of twenty people, according to the police.
To the extremist groups we did not remove their eyes from the top, they warned the police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces crossed the area.
Most of the protesters, who came by car and train from the great cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, including Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Korean, were also as present as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with celestial showers responded by setting up a first concentration for the morning in Copenhagen on the call of Earth's Friends to form "blue seas" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explains Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino soldier at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep saying: There's a time, said the Belgian singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, water courses for which you can walk as never before could have been done.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, established in 1992, with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the anti-globalization movement was close to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, told the AFP that came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the struggle against global warming is not opposed to the fight by another world".
The Oxfam organization along with the former UN Refugee Commissioner, Mary Robinson, who should lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrations, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Pacific region, which collects many very vulnerable islands in the heat, gave the initial score at the exhibitions.
According to the organizers, some 5,000 people went off the road to Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, in most of their students, showed red clothes and light panels for solar energy in front of the Philippines Capital Union.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of protesters claimed to act against climate change were formed.
In France, the "350" network organized demonstrations gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marsella (South), Lille (Northern), Burdeos (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
The assignment of history and geography is strengthened by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview to be transmitted in the Sunday Information Office (JDD, according to his French seal) that history and geography would "strengthened" the reform of general secondary education, although it would be eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific college.
From now on, all first school students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "too much with hypocrisy" because, he says, "Raran C is no longer a scientific branch", but "generally, it calls for the best students".
The Frameworks of General and Literary Education can't be raised by C, it continues to underline: "I also heard that historians or intellectuals were angry at having eliminated history and geography according to bachillerate in technological schools."
An IFOP survey published on Saturday in L'Hhumanité revealed that about seven French ten (69%) rejected the government's project of eliminating compulsory history-geography education according to Bacillerate C. The intellectual and teachers, the left and some right elected representatives also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that "it is not possible" to eliminate the philosophy of second-hand programme C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teaching training, while 16 organizations (students and unionists) called for a day of mobilization to protest against the project, which they consider to be the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year, they will give an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also practice in real terms during the year M2, then be a first year before school as practice teachers.
If you do all the practices before the competition, you will already have a great experience in front of the school, i.e., more than 300 hours, it added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to education, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to explain with conviction the evolution of the climate
Five minutes to talk about the challenges of Copenhagen Summit, it was difficult to accept Saturday morning Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Change (GIEC), invited by the Ulm Street High Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize, opened the "Ernest" conference round, a day composed of a series of 15-minute, filmed and open-ended experts, reported to an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that attracted people and conveyed them with a desire to know more, explained in the framework of the 22-year-old Edward Hannezzo conference, one of the organizers of this day called as the students were baptized to the pieces of the school station.
We chose twenty participants from the experts of their discipline and selected them on their charismatic side, he said.
Regarding global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who showed no notes, but with the help of graphics to 50 people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed by expecting the public to understand that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific expedition".
Videos filmed during these conferences will be online on the school's website from December 15th.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimestral rate.
Retirement in payments: dispute between prison guards, plans to take action
Prison guards called on Friday for a "general mobilisation" to require payment before the end of the year, the premiums and extra hours, which were postponed until today for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Work Force (2 or guards union) requested staff outside the service to join the event tomorrow morning in front of the prisons and "block them" to report the theft of their belongings.
The prison CGT (3rd trade union) calls on them "to meet in general assemblies in different prisons for massive mobilisation", as it is called "probably and unacceptable" the failure of the payment in December of "extraordinary hours, nights' premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first guard union, the Ufap/Unsa, "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and anger".
The Department of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that extra hours increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but ensured that the balance would be allocated in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellor reported that Michele Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the trade unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the staff's efforts to operate and modernise our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I requested the Director of the Prison Administration to immediately implement a set of measures designed to prevent this situation from occurring in the future by a poor assessment of the number of extra hours.
The December payment will then be small, except for staff in the management that enjoys the benefit of famous premiums by functions and objectives, and that "always blames budgetary requirements", Ufap/USA said.
It is a real scandal, said angry at the Interregional FO of Marsella, announcing its decision to boycott up to a new order "all meetings and calls".
The staff will not come to work on the relevant Sundays and holidays if those in October do not pay in December, the same will happen with extra hours, also threatening FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
While we are increasing our tasks and missions without taking any more effective action, it is more regrettable that we dare to attack staff's salaries, he estimates Burdeos' prison CGT.
According to the trade unions, not all regions do the same, as some have more luck than others.
But anyway, the result is not expected, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than those he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas in the White House, confessed to the famous television presenter Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion on gifts: "I do better gifts than those I receive".
During a special interview that the ABC chain will issue on Sunday night, President and his wife Michelle explain how they think about celebrating the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little family friend of four steps, will be from the game.
Father Noel also loves you, said Michelle Obama, explaining that the dog will receive "of course" a gift, according to the program extracts transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama was disappointed with her husband's statements about the quality of the gifts she receives: "No way, last year I made you nice gifts," she provoked the president.
It is true, if you were forced to admit it before answering with humor by pointing to the First Lady's pearl collar: "Who gave you that?"
During an hour's interview, in a remote environment with the well-known encouraging environment that loyally supported the presidential campaign of Barack Obama, the president and his wife also recalled their favorite gifts of the child.
Barack Obama remembered a bike with two speeds, as well as a basketball ball that his Kenyan father, who saw rarely, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball ball, the President said.
Just a few years later, I understand that he had given me that balloon.
On his side, the First Lady recalled her house of monks.
He had no idea how to organize a house, then put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of staying around the house, however, he worshiped that house of monks, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL says it's inducted
Johnny Hallyday was re-interveneed in Los Angeles due to important " injuries" caused by an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to its annexes, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to a coma induced to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again interviewed on Wednesday night at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked "deductions from the operation" of a discal hernia performed in Paris on November 26, he pointed out his press service in that same city, indicating that such injuries "needed a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey silence by stating that the situation was "under control" and informed that a new medical component would be communicated within 48 hours.
According to RTL, the sponsor of the last round of the singer, Johnny Hallyday accepted, however, being subjected to an inducement form to avoid "pangs and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient dies, we will have more certainty about his condition, add RTL.
The press service, questioned by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "by some sources" no channel would have been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of the Monteau Park because of a discal hernia.
The intervention, programmed a few days ago, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
The singer Johnny Hollyday entered the hospital Cedars-Sinaï de Los Angeles on Monday for an infection resulting from the intervention carried out by Delajoux.
The singer Eddie Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained the Thursday in RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time", but made sure there was no "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter".
He just called me before he traveled to Los Angeles, and I told him it was a mistake to make twelve hours of flight after this similar operation, it's not possible, told Eddie Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the music producer Jean-Claude Camus, attempted to calm down by saying that Johnny Hallyday, "was responding satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had talked to Laeticia, the wife of the music, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems multiplied since July when she was pregnant for nine days to give birth to a fall in her yacht.
Two months later, for general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated by a colon cancer after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer repeated his long "Gira 66", presented as his turn of departure.
Since then, however, every health problem has been extremely commented. Fanatics and journalists have noted the difficulties of music to move on stage.
By mid-November, its annexes had even had to demean a new internationalization.
Euro-2009/short pool: first title of Bousquet at its favorite distance
French Frédérick Bousquet, a long pool triple in the World-2009 pool, received an international title at a distance for which he felt special affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition when polyurethane bathers were allowed for the last time, only three world records were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by Russian with 4 x 50 m 4 styles (mosculin).
A fine for Bousquet, which codified the world's record at 50 m free, mark which has a long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queens of the birth, at 50 m free, the 28-year-old French was forced by 20'''53 during a final where they competed for ten nauticalians instead of eight as usual, a primacy at international level.
Bousquet progressed to the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always hope for something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was at my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all nadators wore polyurethane bathers that from 1 January will be banned.
These bathers, from 238 world records since February 2008, end their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the same test for the first time in 1999.
This time the use of bathers did not help German Paul Biedermann, a double world pooling camp this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young nadator failed to lower his mark at 400 m (3:32.77), however, he was forced by the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up on this career.
I knew this time I couldn't beat a world record, but I managed to defend my title and carry out my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: A sarcophage panel owned by Zola sold in USD 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to French writer Emile Zola sold Thursday at $1.5 million, far above the estimated price, announced Sotheby's art merchant.
This panel of 2 metres long for 63 cm high, date of the third century after Christ, and its price was estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "which represents four dynamic scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by Hebrew satiricals and women, is a little common since there are only four or five in the world," explained on Tuesday to AFP Florent Heintz, Vice-President of Ancient Rome and Egypt in Sotheby's AFP.
It was sold between a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most high by the buyers, no doubt, pointed to the AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
Just a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition by Emile Zola.
For nearly 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared in the home of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of his banner in his Parisian special mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the French Republic and President of the Council shortly before the seaman Petain took power.
For some 50 years, his paradera was uncertain.
By reviewing the Louvre Museum's database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola Succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Therèse Raquin" and the freshness of "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras broke out Zelaya's exit to Mexico
The Mexican Thursday felt that the conditions were not given to transfer to its territory to the distinguished president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the coup d'état had refused to do so.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation last night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of the transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, said.
The plane from the Mexican government that arrived Wednesday to El Salvador to take Zelaya back to its original location, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
In order to give him a lifeboat, the golpist government wanted to force Zelaya to "reject" and to ask for political asylum abroad.
But the defeated president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as Head of State in the invited exercise.
The Gulf government "has suffered a new defeat at asking me to give up my job (...), they would like to present my resignation," Zelaya said on Global Radio Thursday, in which he often made statements since the beginning of the political crisis that took five months in the country of Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar, adding some arrangements to the post president, who has been refugees in the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico presented us with a request for rescue, but unfortunately we could not accept it because we did not have an asylum application, said Wednesday Minister of the Interior of the Gulf Government, Oscar Raúl Matute, to HRN Honduran radio.
I will not ask for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya answered in an interview in the Telesur chain, whose seat is in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do it as president of the people of Honduras, he underlined.
The rumors about the Zelaya match moved Wednesday to the supporters of the Vice-President, who met around Brazil's embassy, which was strongly inhabited by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the Gulf Government.
This reflects the marginal nature of this Government in relation to international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela's socialist president, Hugo Chávez, was defeated on 28 June, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare for his election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned to Brazil on 21 September and returned to Brazil.
If so, it will be held and must respond to justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the Gulf government.
The President, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
In the ectrutinian polemic, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but was questioned by countries in Latin America, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until his mandate was completed on 27 January.
Wall Street up, U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Bolsa closed up this Thursday, U.S. trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic recovery of both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67 per cent; and Nasdaq, 0.33 per cent.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405.83 points, and Nasdaq, of a technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.58% (6.40 points) reaching 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza de FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotic, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated on "in the medium-filled vessel".
For Peter Cardillo, from Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures of the U.S. trade balance, "which reflected an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6 per cent in October compared to September, at $32,900 million.
Analysts, on the contrary, looked forward to deepening the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The great news is the increase in the volumes of trade exchanges, in particular exports of goods, reflecting the growth of the major economies trading with the United States, said Christopher Cornell, of the Economic.com research company.
In contrast, last week, unemployment rates in the United States increased unexpectedly, and 474,000 applications were submitted.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new job applicants "was the lowest since one year," stressed Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The liability market fell.
The 10-year-old Treasury bond income rose to 3,482 per cent against 3,423 per cent on Tuesday night, and from 30-to 4,492 per cent on Friday.
Cuba: more than a hundred members of the power cover the "White ladies"
This Thursday, hundreds of Cuban troops drowned the women of political prisoners gathered in La Habana on the global day of human rights and prevented another demonstration where a decade of dissidents were summoned.
Some 40 "Damas de Blanco", wives or family members of political prisoners, were arrested on the street by party members of the government of Raúl Castro while walking towards the capital center, claiming the release of these detainees, supported a journalist of the AFP.
Kill the Yanquis!, "Mercenarios!", "The road belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Viva Fidel and Raúl!" they sang with the puny high-powered soldiers of power to the dissidents.
These were chosen by civil-dressed agents who came to "protect them".
On Friday, a similar demonstration broke out against the "White ladies" in La Habana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Habanare district of Vedado, a dozen residents who also claimed to be present on Thursday for the International Day of Human Rights were arrested by civil-dressed police officers, reported an AFP journalist.
The agents were subjected by force to vehicles to residents who were beaten by government parties, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of residents in similar circumstances will take only a few hours.
The "Damas de Blanco", awarded by the Sajarov Prize 2005 by the European Parliament, had arranged an unauthorized march to "ask for the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to the verdict, declared one of her leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban residents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities charge opposers of "mercenaries" or "agents" against their declared enemy, the United States.
In the media, Cuban television reported on the demonstration of government soldiers' Thursdays against "controversials".
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
A juvenile murder to an octogenary with a knife and left 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two bullets killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in the center of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Highs del Sena) on Thursday at the time of the greater influence of the afternoon.
According to the first elements of the investigation, 28-year-old aggressionr would have hit with two bullets and for reasons not yet determined, an elder in the pharmaceutical field or in front of him in No. 85 of the Jean-Jaurez Boulevard, reported police sources and witnesses.
Because of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a police union officer Alliance.
Then in the medicine or in front of this, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her husband.
The husband, who was about thirty years old, stopped and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were transferred to the hospital where the old man fell.
The life of the other victim, with the apparently affected living organs, is dangerous.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a dementia and was admitted to "in shock state", reported a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by bulver Jean Jaurès.
Apparently, he would have hit two more petons: a man of thirty years, and another of forty-four seriously.
By night, the scene of the crime was still unexplained.
He was armed with two carnivorous bullets that were carrying him across the back, explained in place a leader of the Alliance union at the Highs of the Year, Arnaud Pressé.
Several transitors, including young people, tried to control the young man, according to the testimony received by the AFP.
I saw a guy from about thirty years old with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't do it because the guy was strong, explains Alberto, a roommate from a nearby bar.
A crowd came up to him, including a police officer who had broken the mussel, added.
By the fireman Jean-Jaurez, at the height of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were beaten at police stations, according to the evidence.
The facts were produced in one of Clichy-la-Garenne's major arteries, where there are many shops.
Some people came to tell me there was a man injured in the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old gentleman in the room. When I put him in a safe position, I realized a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmaceutical.
Five minutes later, a second person of about 35 years arrived with knife wounds.
Effective national police arrested the man without identity papers.
Nanterre's Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the High Police of the Year (SDPJ 92).
The place was hospitalized on Thursday night.
During his temporary detention, he has not said a word.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of entering it into a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to dominate him in Clichy's commission where he was transferred.
It was "in the state of overcrowding" as "all disturbed by this type of force which significantly increases under the effect of action".
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again asks that the case be dismissed
The French-Polish film lawyer Roman Polanski once again complained this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), who is considering the case against his client, who is under domestic arrest in Switzerland, for a sexual abuse committed more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of "The Pianist", accused three judges of the Second California District Appeals Chamber of Appeal of serious procedural errors at the time of the facts in 1977.
Hummel stated: I claim that at the same time the charges are dismissed, since the conduct of the judge at the time of the case, Laurence Rittenband, "was a terrible result".
According to him, Judge Rittenband (who has failed since then) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have commented that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison before giving a sentence, which is a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), by the prosecutor's own mouth, David Wells.
But Wells finally declared in late September "have lied" to the author of the document.
Hummel called for the conduct of a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument if the court rejected the conviction.
The charge, by its part, reiterated the argument put forward in the first instance, namely that there could be no serious assessment of the charges in both Roman Polanski would not be presented before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled from the United States in 1978 before being sentenced to "illegal sexual relations" with less than 13 years.
Since then, he has never again weighed the United States.
The district deputy of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "must be here to present himself in the audience".
For this reason, we want to send the message not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is a possibility of escaping? Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "demonstrates the court, although he hates its authority".
One of the three judges, who now has 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee".
Hummel wasn't the only one who asked me to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also complained once more to close the case.
He argues that his client no longer supports her every time she wakes up the Polanski case, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, it's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland by a North American arrest order.
After more than two months after the raids, he was sentenced to domestic detention in his head of Gstad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street loses its way and is frozen by the dollar's height
New York's Bolsa closed this Friday without a turnaround, in a market where there is a debate between indicators better than expected in the United States and the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average raised 65.67 points, reaching 10,471,50 points, while Nasdaq, a technological component, lost 0.55 points to be located at 2,190.31 points.
The standard & Poor's 500 expanded index was 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106,41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, noted Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with close margins, the volume of exchanges is increasingly reduced and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend was maintained through the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve market opinion on the stability of economic recovery", Charles Schwab's analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November by two consecutive months and more than expected.
In addition, the U.S. consumer's trust was recovered visible in December, 73.4 versus 67.4 last month, according to the preliminary estimates of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indexes were shaken by a new advance of the dollar which reached the highest level of the last two months in front of the euro, which "takes down to the sectors sensitive to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick, of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values have lost ground.
The liability market fell.
The 10-year-old stock income rose to 3,540 per cent against 3,482 per cent on Wednesday night, and from 30-to 4,497 per cent on Thursday.
Miss World's election again in South Africa
After a month of rotation across South Africa, the 112 candidates under Miss World are in the final right to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of thousands of spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized by the second consecutive year around Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran de Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo de Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino de Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma de Canada were elected Miss Sportsist or, even, Miss Top Model during her stay in Africa.
It was a real revelation.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
You have so many things and I have lived countless experiences!' said surprised Mrs. Sierra Leone.
This conviction, which will take place in South Africa nine times, will be transmitted on Saturday live from Midandrand to the North of Johannesburg from 17 a.m. (15 h GMT).
It's impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very pleased that I have lived twice, notes Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the summer of the Austral summer.
For the young Russian, his second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with candidates and by the possibility of discovering again "African landscapes that remove the encouragement".
After a month of galas, tests, press wheels and safaris, the candidates to Miss World are focused on the conviction.
India Pooja Chopra expects to be able to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted into Bollywood stars.
The dream of all women is crowned as the most beautiful of the world, but it is not just appearance.
We are ambassadors from our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, declares Miss India with a great smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will disappear with traditional clothes and, of course, with bathroom.
The Chinese rapporteur, Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen, Michelle McLean, and a committee member, Steve Douglas, will conduct the event.
South Africa proved to be able to receive the world with great warmth and pride, assuring Julia Morley, president of the Miss World Summit.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited Soweto's famous cityship, but this time on bicycle, and enjoyed the local cuisine.
As an extraordinary act, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who tied their hands.
A little common to a Head of State, Miss Sierra Leone.
Its best memory will no doubt be the luck in Cape Town (Sweden) for the World Football World in June 2010, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've been dealing with people I've never thought of getting to know.
He's probably back to World 2010, says excited Miss Italia, Alice Tacichi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," David assured his son on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his hosted father several days ago.
News is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything's coming out very well, said to the press David Hallyday at the bottom of the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13 local hours (21 h GMT).
The son of the singer, who was released, made sure that he would be transferred to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered the moon for a sexually transmitted infection on November 26th in Paris.
The music is "as induced from that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to avoid suffering and thus manage its treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered the moon for an infection, a century of a skirmish surgery last November 26th in Paris.
The singer was once again operated Wednesday night on Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife, Laeticia, was in the morning at the French school in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade, to attend a school event, confirmed an AFP photographer.
The Chief of orthopedic surgery and Traumatology at the Pitie-Salpètriere Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer viciously accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer last November 26th at the international private clinic at the Monteau Park in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
The Surgeons of Los Angeles said they were angry, Camus said.
It's about a possible claim, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus claimed that Johnny Hallyday had " Traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke directly to the doctor, and he surprised me when he made sure that there was no problem in making the trip, since I was operated twice by a discal hernia, he added.
Shortly before the RTL station, he indicated that the singer seemed to have "goed without a channel, nothing" after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in the artistic environment.
He worked at the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, at a Neuily-sur-Seine clinic where Delajoux worked at the time.
In 2007, I also interviewed the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed from a cerebral hemorrhage.
It is a doctor with a bad reputation, condemned by justice on several occasions by mal practice, as well as by tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer from the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a man with no scruples" claiming "regularly" to the Order Council, and he's "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention "was done without any inconvenience" and that the results of postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "can't cause bleeding and therefore don't need a drain," he added.
In any way, the singer's circle, whose health problems have multiplied since summer, has become a parentheses.
No doubt, taking back the turn on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as I expected, I feel very risky, said Camus.
UDF raises the tone and warns the New Centre about the use of its seal
The UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem (Democratic Movement), reacted this Friday before the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, tried to launch an OPA (Requisition Public Offer) on the seal of the former Giscardist party, hoping to withdraw it from its full support, and regret it.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF seal, since he believed François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after he had put his hand on his left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In support of its management, she received the help of Mr Hervé de Charette (ex UMP, current NC) who claims the ownership of the UDF brand, since she was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, UDF's office, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to be deprived of this, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the MP in order to give up the seal and transfer the rights of the brand to them, in the face of a court order.
In recent days, you have made many statements suggesting that they will propose their political movement to recover the UDF seal, writing the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centralist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the name of the movement, the +New Centre+, and the logo +l'UDF today'hui+ in its military material and on the site's presentation page, support the signers of the letter.
As they already know, they have no right to use the seal, explains the UDF office that requires NC to withdraw "an immediate mention of the name of UDF of all support, as well as its (your) website".
He also asked Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) mark to the legitimate beneficiaries".
Otherwise, it will be called for justice to respect the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, warning the signatories.
In the letter, they need UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and they remember that Morin and his friends "elected" to go in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Centre does not, they say, have no right to use the UDF seal.
They also recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and the establishment of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when the mark was registered", it was no longer "member of UDF for three years", but UMP.
Use it in a scandalous and misleading way the lack of registration of the UDF acronym to perform it by its account.
This indiscriminateness is being transformed into crime, they complain, before the NC's strategy comes into play: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more proper to do your own name than to try to get out of the anonymity by taking a name that has no right to it."
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
This Friday the Nanterre Court decided to render judgment on the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the multimillionaire's daughter Liliane Bettencourt says, he took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenarian to exploit her part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photographs of the show stars, will be sentenced on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime which is a maximum of three years in prison and 375.000 euros in fines.
This means that in this case there will be a proper process of saga on one of France's richest families, in which the mother and daughter dispute the roots of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
But the Court also ordered that Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, bettencourt should be subject to medical examination by three medical professionals.
L'Oréal's hereditary and main shareholder has always refused to submit to such examinations, even more under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Taxation during the investigation.
The doctors appointed this Friday should submit a report before 10 March 2010 which should indicate whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weaknesses and for what period.
I think he'll accept it.
I'm going to talk to her, said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kijeman, when she left the audience.
On the other hand, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was satisfied with the court's decision.
It's a great news... The investigation will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we must protect, said.
Two years ago, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter began criminal action against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of taking advantage of her mother's weakness for thousands of euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or art works.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, whom he considered to be a long-term friend.
On Friday, while the court examined the origin of the action initiated by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' allegations resulted in a large family confession on several occasions.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters that his client would send (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary in which he said he was mistrusted by Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for 15 years.
Since his marriage, I've never been able to talk to Françoise again."
On its part, Nanterre's Office once again considered that the applicant was not in a position to compare, as much as a guardian judge refused, in these last days, to make his request to open a judicial protection procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to compare to justice, is not under protection and has no tutor.
No other person can share in his place," said the representative of the Ministry of Public Affairs, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that the judgment on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers would be delivered once again.
Administrative revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with respect to their employees reminded consumers of their position before the marketing revolution: it is a matter of contributing to certain "values" since then to impose on consumers products intended for manufacturing techniques.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave him his place in the market winning strategies... although the authoritarian attempt to impose products that are not related to customer preference factors is repeated regularly.
An employee demobilization can end in a deadly demolition.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the point of an even more general phenomenon that affects executives in particular.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all company's intellectual functions, especially I+D and, more importantly, business intelligence.
In fact, the Business Intelligence BI "needs all parties involved (...) to have a proactive behaviour and a prospective vision"; this requires by employees a commitment that is fully opposed to the recommendations of an authority.
That is why we call for an administrative revolution, which would consist of putting the partners at the centre of the company's concerns as much as the customer.
Internal opinion surveys have a relatively useful
Will internal opinion investigations, such as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, encourage the administrative revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I could see that, in the face of a new situation, and after a lot of times, all the companies end up doing essentially... what they always did! B989
- Second, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologys of power, increases proportionately to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most of the directors have a simple view of human behavior.
As they come from large engineering schools, they interpret psychology mechanically.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the ancient conductive theory that American neurosciences have recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media have widely spread their support.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage "commands" (sic) of the executive commitment, a recent Ips research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the guidelines in a mechanical management position, which is not adapted to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the necessary administrative revolution for the good functioning of modern companies is intended to adopt a definitive vision of human behavior.
It is to integrate in any reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for the employees, commitment with the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of making it part of its dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Motifunctional Analysis have adopted this concept of employees' motivations.
Studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a default dose that allows them, through the image they have from the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of mobilization factors, corporate guidelines can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and re-management of human resources "on-site".
In this way, they create a favourable land for organized development of a strong and efficient business intelligence.
Oslo's speech: through "right war" Obama receives right praises
This Friday, the North American right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, called for a speech by Obama on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had denied the award to Obama on 9 October, this time praised the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former candidate for the Vice-President during the 2008 elections.
I liked what she said, said Mrs. Palin, the main figure of the right hand of the Republican party in the newspaper USA Today, and she added that she herself had addressed the subject of war "at times necessary" in her recently published memories.
In my view, the war is, since then, the last thing the North Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
There's got to be a stop to terrorists, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days ago.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very good, the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For the moment, the talk seemed very historical, Gingrich said, during an interview on the "The Takeaway" radio program.
The former elected representative, whom some consider to be a potential candidate for the Republican investment for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to hear "a left president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not deliver a peace prize if the resource did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speeches and current Chronist in Washington Post, Obama spoke "a very North American speech".
In addition to being presented as "a citizen of the world", as "always doing it", "he spoke as a North American president" when he reminded Europeans "who live in a security hole they didn't create and do not do much to preserve it," said Gerson.
Among the few unconfirmed right-wings, a Bush era Halcón, former United Nations ambassador John Bolton, qualified for the "monoton, pretentious and lack of inspiration" speech on the website of the National Review Online.
On the left hand of the President, democratic representative Dennis Kucinich alarmed when he saw Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we covered the war with the notion of justice, it was easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the left-wing press praised the president.
The English Time, although still believing that Obama had received the Nobel earlier, qualified his "superproduction" speech especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," said the California newspaper.
Obama "pronounced the speech that was necessary," said the New York Times, judging it "as a shadow and as a building."
Road transport: three Marathon negotiations to ensure navigation
After three marathon negotiations, the trade unions of the road sector and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only patrol organization that remained until the end, came to an agreement by Friday afternoon ending with the strike and the threat posed by maritime supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, the State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "blessed" the agreement, after several negotiations began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators were sent before Friday with the hope that the text would be signed quickly at the end of the morning.
Even when three parental organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) were withdrawn, a port was given.
But a more than six-hour meeting that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for all to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "must have been very harmful to companies" and "it was feared that the end of the year would disturb the parties," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for the lowest wages (on local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The rate per hour is above €8.72 to €9.06 for low wages.
It's not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantages, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will order our soldiers that there are no more cuts or blocks in the supply centres.
But there may always be some rebellious disconform, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of the TLF, acknowledged that it was "a good deal", although it was "hard to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, increases will be in the order of EUR 170 per month for low wages and EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
It is a common agreement that respects the shareholders, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as a "historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT), it is a "acceptable commitment".
The agreement also provides for an increase in the travel costs of 3 per cent and the holding of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will allow for, above all, the issue of an extraordinary payment and modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a less than 100 million euros in patrol charges" was the subject of an amendment by the Government in the draft rectification funding bill for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The Government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms".
The TLF signature allows the agreement to be applied firstly to companies belonging to this organization and secondly to all professions where the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It'll be "with the greatest speed," Bussereau assured.
The opposition of parental organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR claimed that it was a "engineering business", since the 100 million euros "had been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax".
The State Secretary of Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to contradict those who wanted to eat bread at the next Nochebuena dinner, the Unostra lamented.
For OTRE, the agreement threatens "the stability of most SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, trade unions in accordance with the RATP proposals
Conflicts in RR A, France's largest urban public transport line, continued during the weekend, because at the Friday meeting, the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and the direction of RATP, there was no agreement and trade unions were dissatisfied with their first request.
For this important weekend of shipping purchases, on Saturday and Sunday only trains will travel between 10 and 20 hours, due to a train of two on the central tram (between La Defende and Nation) and a train of four on the other lines.
Interconnection with SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change train.
The Lafayette Gallery, which expects 200,000 customers every day, was pleased that "RATP is trying to provide services to large shops".
The RER Cross West to East Paris City.
The RATP tram runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Leger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one of the two trains circled in hours at a point, and almost no train in hours valley, as was expected.
The Thursday was not wasted in the fields due to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
In this way, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less competitive than normal, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nkwana, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had been up "an hour and a half earlier to arrive at the clock".
The Saint-Lazare station was unsatisfied, indicated by the SNCF, which had provided for police and order forces.
The RERs operating the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or with its destination arrived or participated in Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
New general meetings of strike workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results will be analysed, "little satisfaction" according to the trade unions, of a meeting held with the management of Friday afternoon.
The Director of ERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects of ER A: working time, professional development, etc.
This is not what drivers want to claim a premium due to them, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even put among parents its initial proposals, he commented angrily to the CGT, pointing out that the direction "was unable to solve a problem that SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is planned on Monday for "a more extensive analysis of the conditions of exercise of the profession", RATP said.
What also led the trade unions to say that the company "did not import users at the end of the week".
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at headquarters in Paris.
Then the direction, which had been refused until then to speak during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the water".
The conflict could be extended to RR B on Tuesday, after the United Nations and the Independents had submitted a warning.
The unions demand a premium of EUR 120 (United States) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 is variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line with a million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all of them in the second degree of their professional career, cost from EUR 2,200 to EUR 2,700 gross and from EUR 600 to EUR 650 premiums per hour with alternative shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dislodged the procuring party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court failed Friday in favour of the resolution of the country's main procuring party, a decision that immediately provoked demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the South-East of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could be very difficult for the Government, which just held a hand to the Kurdish community trying to end it by 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was disappointed because it had become "a focus of activities that affected the independence of the State and its inalienable unity", said the press President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberation.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes were needed to get the resolution, Kilič indicated, and he added that 37 of the party's leaders, including his President Ahmet Türk and Mr Aysel Tugluk, are separate from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the end of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turkey and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the property of the party by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (from 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that the Members would leave Parliament before being parliamentary without a party label.
The decision stems from a procedure launched by the Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya in 2007, which accuses DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many more countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal escape of the PKK's rebels.
However, the party ensures that it does not have "Organical ties" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the Government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict is at a time when the Government holds its hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures that strengthen its rights, so that Kurds cease to support the PKK and thus end the conflict.
The DTP leaders stated that a resolution could generate a recovery of tensions in the South Anatolio, where a large number of demonstrations against the terms of detention of PKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan were due to police confrontations over the last few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have met in front of DTP sites in Diyarbakir, the great care of the South-East population in most of its Kurds.
The Order Forces threw lacrimogen grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators fired Molotov bombs or stones with honds.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Turk stated that the decision of justice was going to "increase discouragement".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (kurda, NDLR) by resolving a party, declared the press.
The Government, formed by a party from the Islamic movement, also regrets the decision.
We are at first opposed to the closure of the parties.
So nothing is resolved, Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz said.
This decision completely rejected the democratic openness launched by the government, political analyst Ahmet Isel commented.
We can, of course, expect a PKK reaction, added.
This Thursday, the PKK was assisted by an attack that killed seven soldiers three days ago in North Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks of the past few months.
Snowflakes can begin suddenly
A really fresh winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
In general, it is something that wants to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of maintenance of the EES winter.
But their employees can learn to test and dominate the whole of vehicle technology.
Maybe at the end of the week the meteorologists announced it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the EES shall act in accordance with a minimum plan.
As soon as snow profusely falls in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A trams with large vehicles with salt, Brauburger explains.
These include, for example, major arteries and adventures such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also the access to the body of bombs, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and we work with hostages, such as Atselbergstraße.
The FES service starts around three in the morning
It should cover approximately 1,040 kilometres, as necessary, within a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which is better attached.
That's why the FES starts around three in the morning, "so the roads are free until it starts traffic at the point".
It's hard when it starts to snow about 7:30.
"Then we have a problem," comments the road maintenance director in winter, "because then no one is ready to leave space for the vehicles with salt."
Immediately thereafter, when he is no longer snowing, he plays on secondary and private roads, which also belongs to Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the lateral and secondary roads.
That's where the disturbances are generated, you know, Braubburger.
Around five in the morning, the FES's childhood is being launched, mainly by dangerous and cross points.
In general, the EFS could not be charged with all bicycles.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 do not lose sight mainly of the bridges, comments Braburger.
As these become reheated quickly, the vehicle with salt is running as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In the event of an emergency, the police may also call them.
The Coin of the Dynosium
The Tawa hallae had the same aspect as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal of two metres long and 1.50 meters high that ran over the two strong backpaths, had an extended head with attached teeth and curves, short arms with wooden hooks and a long neck.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it wouldn't have been special.
But the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The species lived some 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then located in a dry area of the continent of Pangea in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window towards the early evolution of dinosaurs, comments Nesbitt.
It tells us much about the genetic relationship, the promotion and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging into Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes we have found a dozen dinosaur bones one day, this is something unprecedented for Triasco's sediments, reports Randall Irmis a member of the Utah Natural History Museum team.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remaining five species were totaled.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional finding: "Treasic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other experts in dinosaurs do not share all such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, for example Martin Sander of Bonn University.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts are discussing, for example, when sauries were divided into their three most important genetic lines: the carnivorous therapists between whom Tyrannosaurus Rex is found, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadruped sauropods known as "long dog" and their relatives, and the Ornithischia herbivorous (sauri with bird pelvis), to which they belong, for example, the Tricerotops and Stegosaurus species.
According to Nesbitt's analysis and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is a primitive therapist.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, comments Nesbitt.
For example, researchers found airbags in the Tawa skull, such as those who also own the descendants of the therapists, birds.
Thanks to airbags, bird breathing is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawae there was also the bones of the Vertebral column were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the therapist with older and primitive air bags, comments Randall Irmis.
Because the parent line of later giant sauropods also had air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migrational waves towards North America
Due to the fact that the most primitive dinosaurs have so far lived in South America, researchers claim that the sauris have emerged there for the first time.
As a result, the three genetic lines were separated at an early stage and extended from South America by all the corners of the Earth, which was therefore still a unique earth mass, the Pangea supercontinent.
However, the facts say that the team met with Tawa found the rest of the other two very closely associated therapists.
The three cannot descend from a single forwarder, the researchers argue.
We believe there have been at least three migration waves to North America, comments Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science Study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
A more ancient species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a group of dinosaurs, lived in the present Poland, comments the paleontologist of Bonn Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted picture, because in South America many fossils of dinosaurs continue to be preserved, while in other continents there is only something to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs have achieved the evolution of a relatively rare colonial line of reptiles to the dominant lands of Mesozoic remains an enigma.
In the Triasico, dinosaurs still shared their vital space with many other reptiles, for example with ancestors of current cocodries and pterosaurs and with many other sauri.
At the end of the Triasico, dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while parental ties remained at the boundary of the Triasico towards the Jurasic.
The successful stories were never eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, comments Martin Sander.
There could have been a massive extinction of which dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could defeat the invaders in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a sudden meteorite impact increased the growth of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triasico and since then had led to a miserable existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to São Paulo
The list is wide and international signatures.
They are participants of professors at the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley in California.
They were attended by teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, São Paulo, Berlin, and Bremen.
The police release of the casino occupied by the Goethe University of Frankfurt affected the whole world.
278 teachers and cathedrals of the Goethe University, although also of higher education centres throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarity with students in protest at the Westend Camp.
In a statement written in German and English, they "retain" the police release promoted by the Governing Council.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the University, resigned last week the building occupied by students and teachers in an educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
Material damage, judges the signatories, does not justify "the violent resolution of courses organized by the same students and cathedrals by a police command".
The resignation represented "an unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism was "the delegitimization and criminalization of the protest" and turned its attention to its content.
The Governing Council has refused to conclude the necessary negotiations.
The doctors require immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most of the employees have not caused material damage, it is said.
We're on a protest.
Young people from the Verdi Union and the German Federation of Trade Unions are also united with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of growing concern for the future itself, comments the national youth secretary of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Sciences of Hessen, however, defended the conduct of the director of the university and the police.
We're grateful to the director of the university.
The destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he commented on an issue by Current Stunde on Thursday in the Parliament of the province of Wiesbaden.
We are understanding with the protest, but we are not understanding with vandalism, said Peter Booth, a representative of the Provincial Parliament by the CDU.
The opinion of opposition groups, the SPD, the Greens and the Left is different.
The CDU used as a precedent the walls painted to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of studying the students' arguments and requirements in depth, they are dismissed.
The left has submitted a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, not accessible to Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was a highly guarded site in the Soviet Union for the secret research of arms.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 km from the centre of Moscow, is considered to be the "Russian Silicon Valley".
There are important research and production centres for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted Riedberg's scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, with universities and companies at the Frankfurt Centre for Innovation (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now Wednesdays, Selenogrado and Riedberg signed a "Protocol of Close Cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Vice-Altalde Moscow Juri Rosljak and Selengrad's mayor, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt, he signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010 they will travel to a seminar in Selenograd by representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Natural Science Research Centre.
Scientific mode
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it also addresses commercial relations.
The FIZ companies will have the possibility of placing a foot on the growing Russian market.
Russian scientific companies, however, wish to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the headquarters of important Russian research companies and institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronica.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "City of Social Planning" for arms research.
Selenogrado (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forest mountains, where research facilities were located.
Scottgart's Frenos
Stuttgart 21 is not placed for anything high enough.
For project participants it is simply and far from "the new heart of Europe".
The law is known. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a demonstration project, which will precipitate a decade of unremediated construction sites to the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which ended in the middle of the city, were then considered fossil engineering in the 19th century, which acted as brakes of modern rail traffic, since there was an enormous amount of time needed to fill the rear locomotors forward.
Rodar, stop drying the trip; but this must be done.
And that's why the terminals should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a step-by-step station, which is located about half of the trans-European operation lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Europe's Heart".
The S21 will actually be launched, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have learned that in Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost impossible to implement the reduction.
The railway terminals of course do not have any more problems of entry and exit, since there are reversible locomotors with tractor unit and driver's car on both sides.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE-built tram towards Ulm will already be launched.
Federal and municipal politicians have made it available.
The railway also continues because the risks of the major individual projects of infrastructure in the Republic are borne by the contributor and not by the State.
From a urban point of view, the project is still justified to a certain point.
New urban space is created, providing many green areas, probably from the graphics generated by the designer's computer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The step-by-step station and violent support are intended for the transport of people, which was attributed to the huge typical growth in the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first be involved in strengthening the transport of goods, since rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport.
However, the new construction trains are good for cargo trains due to the gradiental intensity.
Even more serious is that S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros should be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official number.
Experts consider it to be more realistic between 10 and 15 billion.
It is certain that in the next decade, money will be missing in other crossroads and close crossings on the network.
A total of 60 major projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometers of long rails through the river Rin.
Since 1987 the track has been built slowly.
It would be urgent here to press the accelerator as it is due.
However, S21 acts as a brake.
The stream of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international transport of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The Government shall examine the judgement on the airport.
The federal government remains standing in the autonomous Parliament of Wiesbaden, if an appeal is to be submitted to the Hesse Administrative Tribunal for the Prohibition of Nightly Flights.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts the legal investigation of the VGH judgment of more than 400 pages, according to the Minister for Economic Affairs, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had established in writing on this date, which, in the case of the construction of the Northwest landing track planned at Frankfurt airport, the federal state would have to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as provided by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide by 4 January if the appeal appeal against this judgment is to be submitted.
The opposition criticised this post-posterization and pressured government representatives to give up the appeal appeal before the Administrative Court of the Nation in Leipzig.
The Head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their commitments to ban the night air traffic, which had been carried out before the elections.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to fulfill his word, said the Greens Chief Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We have fulfilled our word".
Minister Posch rejected the criticism of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the federal government would be trying to obtain its nightly flights through law enforcement and tricks.
A thorough legal investigation would take a long time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of "first quick printing".
We need a legally binding decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As represented by the opposition, the claims of its group on the prohibition of night air traffic would never have been made.
The U.S. banks return the aid granted.
The large U.S. banks affected by the crisis are behind their state arrests.
The Bank of America returned only once the aid that had provided it with the Tarp bank redemption fund of a total of 45,000 million (about EUR 30,000 million).
The Citi Group also plans to return State aid, according to a United States CBC report.
The institutions are thus seeking to relieve themselves of the restrictions which have gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as restrictions on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high rates.
The Bank of America had obtained some 19 billion cash liquid through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum took it from its own box, which had enough means, among others, for the sale of rubles.
Banking Director Kenneth Lewis thanked the evening afternoons especially for the US contributors: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The banker's house had badly calculated the effort to absorb the investment bank in the climate of the financial crisis.
The Citi Group also seeks to obtain money in the capital market in order to free itself from its obligations to the State.
The NCB informed of a source of known circles that the United States bank could already announce the increase in its capital by $20 billion for this Thursday.
A representative of the Citi group did not want to comment.
In June they had already returned their aid to Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Select
At last everything was faster than you thought.
Just two weeks after the administrative board of the ZDF (German television channel) pressed the editor chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel may present a successor.
Yesterday night, the jury wanted to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the main ZDF study in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the station, officially in order not to prejudge the procedure.
But it must also have influenced no further damage to ZDF director Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be approved in the administrative council.
Frey, the candidate for Schächter, needs the support of nine of the 14 members.
The outcome of the vote was not yet concrete at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the administrative board with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's defeat was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because most of the Union in the administrative council had already indicated weeks before the election, that they would not support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the editor-in-Office had been organized by the President of the Hesse Government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He stated another mandate of the prestigious editor with the argument that, under the direction of Brender, ZDF's information would have lost audit figures.
Not long before the elections, there were protests due to this, in which the political influence on the ZDF was weakened.
At the end, 35 public law specialists had been involved in the debate, which qualified the Koch procedure as constitutional.
But he didn't use anything.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Roman philosophy.
Then he worked at the Southwestfunk station and at the Frankfurt Rundschau newspaper.
In 1983 he changed to the ZDF, starting with the "heute-day" information.
The following stations: 1988 to 1990; 1991/92 in Washington; up to 1998 director and director of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; up to 2001 director of the external policy of the ZDF; then director of the ZDF study in capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional claim after the destruction of Brender, which was still elected as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazine".
Unlike Koch in the Administrative Council, the President of the Government of Renania-Palatinado, explained last week that federal states should change the ZDF's state agreement in such a way that the Director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A partial withdrawal of ZDF control forces was withdrawn by Beck.
The likely successor of Brender, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended before the administrative council with an intelligent play: he strongly criticized Brender's disappearance.
Thanks to this trial of journalism, Schächter was able to appoint him for the post of editor without losing his face, as the administrative council could vote for him, without falling under suspicion of giving him the post to a party robbery.
In the calculations of the Frey parties, it is dedicated in all ways to the liberals on the left.
The university careers are dissipated
Partly success for students: after a year of shootings related to education, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the Federal States finally gave up. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university directors, both sides agreed to try to improve the study conditions in the case of licensing and master.
Students in a future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically each train module should end with a single exam.
It is also intended to consider the work of the students, and it is intended to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
The policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of results of examinations between universities inside and outside Germany.
The federal states are committed to making structural rules more flexible together for Bachelor and Master careers.
The regulations of the federal states that differ from this should no longer exist.
Minor exams
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the Ministers for Education and Culture and the directors of universities have been talking about improving the ability to carry out and successfully complete a career (study).
For the first time there was talk about a particular content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with a single examination", says a 30-page document, which aims to regulate partially the approval of university careers.
The "sensitive reduction of the burden of examinations" aims to avoid development in a wrong direction, which would have a significant impact on the study, as explained by Mr. Reinhold Grimm, Director of the Accreditation Board.
In addition to a future "study" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and content should be carefully examined with regard to unnecessary restrictions on the choice of students.
The courses.
Students should have "the right to more space, which enables and encourages their own initiative".
These rules would apply to new careers, but also in the examination of existing careers.
These should "recredit" again every five years. But this would mean that it would be late by 2015 to review all the careers.
Those responsible for this would be at the national level 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, established by the federal states.
Ministers of education and culture urged federal states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the number of materials and examinations were not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
So far only Renania-Platinada has made it possible to provide additional means for the subsequent development of the Bolonia process.
With this money, universities should implement student training and advice programmes, as well as strengthen examination and external offices.
The Federal State and universities claim to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wanted to bring to Parliament a new university law.
It should be sufficient for a single examination for the completion of a career model.
The career configuration should be made more flexible, as well as ensuring the recognition of evaluations at other universities and facilitating access to the Master.
Until the end of the coming year it is intended to consider all careers about its "study".
This Thursday the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions of study in the federal state.
There were also criticisms of decisions on the part of the praisers.
At the federal level of the Juso (socialist youth) university groups, the directive demanded that the configuration of educational policy should no longer be "under closed doors" of the ministers and university directors.
Later on after the shootings of education, students as main involved should also be able to think.
The president of the University Board of Directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave his support to the students: "We need students' experience", said Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
For the union of education and science (GEW), Bonn's agreements were not enough: the union requires a legal right for each student with the title of Bachelor to access a post-master career.
In addition, federal states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in a sufficient future study space for Master with the best possible study conditions. Thus a member of GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller, informed him.
Federal states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But with more access to the master, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a note on Herta Müller's leg
"Entering and leaving Germany is practically uncontrollable," says the first line of a poem by lyric Werner Söllner in disequilibrated language fragments, which discusses the experiences of coming to Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked at the beginning as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in an editorial of children's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literary awards, in 1993 he attended the memorable lectures or poetry talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum in Hesse in Moussonturm in Frankfurt.
He said to talk enough last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror described by its security agents"
Apparently insecure and embarrassed, Søllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as an IM in the Romanian secret service Security against German-Roman writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Prize.
The recruitment attempts had begun slowly in early 1971.
"So I am someone who has not defended enough against attempts to provoke fear of security," Söllner concluded.
The lyric Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the grant of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller and its literary polymycology without equal to the digital rule mechanisms, the literary scene and in particular the German community of authors from around Romania are undermined by a case that demonstrates the dangers and the evils of a political system, based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as it is known so far, not only the author, but also the victim.
In his IM Walter's security agent had played a role, Literary scientist Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, and stressed the influence for him positive of the IM Walter.
He had apologized or defended it at all difficult points for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement in this way and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of an ex-dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable shelter for spies from the Security-Spitzel Gewesen, wrote Herta Müller already in July in the week "Zeit", after reading her own 914 pages.
Those involved will certainly have speculated and will have learned in some cases what names are hidden behind Sorin's, Voicu's and Walter's.
Unlike the review of the Stasi expeditions with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment with the security control expeditions is still quite widespread.
A systematic clarification has been debated and difficult in recent years.
A National Council for the Explanation of Security Ambassadors (CNSAS) of the Birthler Authority was formed in 1999, and since then the delivery of consignments has been better monitored.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of shippers.
An interview, following the grant of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still quite large. In this interview an ex-chief of the Temesvar Security spoke negatively of the condecoration.
"She has psychosis," they finally asked her once.
The infamity of power seemed to be shown without any return under the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as often as there are closed charges.
Why is it right now? To whom has it hurt? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession leaves it to hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the concerns of knowledge and not so much by guilt and shame.
For the genius of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature, it is more than a simple note to the foot.
The League of Champions as a guarantee to fill the stomach
When the new VfB football team coach from Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by a brand-new plastic bag from his team provider, approached a Class C Mercedes taxi a quarter after midnight, he was impressed that a member of the outside service in elegant dress would be coming out of a very nice Christmas celebration, where the sports producer would have distributed samples.
The man of the calva feature had hired a driver, because he had not yet met the city.
Moreover, he could also drive the car himself: at the end of the day, there was no alcohol in the game, and neither was the man 55 years old happy.
It had been a pleasant summer, but tomorrow I would start working again.
I'd start it for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, which had only been hired three days ago: "It is true that we reach the eighth of the finals," namely, in the League of Champions, through triumph 3:1 against Urzicen Union of Romania, "but we cannot let us blind for success: we will have to fight against the decline.
The "most important field" expected them the next Sunday, he said.
Then there will be a need to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "real classes" in the dailyity of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly demonstrated again, after the rapid three holes of Marica (5), Trésch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sort
The final eight of the League of Champions (parts of the age 16/17 and 23/24 of February/parts of the return 9/10 and 16/17 of March) will be held in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy was limited by the devastating entry of the successor of Babel.
Not only on the supposed rescuer, who had recently inspired the unconquired professionals of Stuttgart to trust themselves, ready to deliver and enjoy the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to concentrate on their strong points, urged them to be more fired, explained the repairer of Gross soul's recipe of success that sounds so simple, but that with the Babel therapist it had no effect anymore.
He exposed some magic, accepted Babbel's partner, Jens Lehmann, "when in football a new impulse arises, sometimes things that were not believed to be possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a couple of weeks of injury, moved immediately to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomen" perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and how to work with the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes deeply, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And that's what I missed when I was Babel.
VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the test yet, warns sports director Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs everything.
Like Gross, players and administrators were also reluctant to overestimate the triumph against a weak defence due to lack of attention and full re-founded by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had arrived the sad wake, he thought Khedira.
And Director Horst Heldt warned that although a target of the season had been achieved, the other was still very far away.
We haven't overcome the problem yet.
That Heldt would not want to celebrate in his 40th performances, even after the first victory in his seat three months ago, was due to the events at the end of the week, which were re-updated in the form of a television interview, transmitted just before the start of the game, which had been granted by the porter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions others make, and not Jens, Heldt faced Lehmann's critical burden.
This had condemned weakness in the direction of the Board of Directors, who had decided to change from trainer to trainer by pressure from adolescent fans.
It would also have been eliminated after the games as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness", rejected Heldt, and announced consequences for the latter.
They'll probably not be friends forever, the two forty-two.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the previous efforts with the team of the replacement trainer, it would not have been possible for the show of great strength of game and battle.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important participation in success," said Heldt and Lehmann to the union; and he also agreed with the man of the plastic plate.
World heavy weight champion play
Argentinian duo in Berna: once and again Rector Kevin Johnson was causing the Vitali Klitschko World Championship with words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his weight-weighted title in the WBC version.
The judge's judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko continues to be a world heavy weight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC version won on Friday evening in Bern with Kevin Johnson in the United States for a unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was its third successful defence of the title since its return in October 2008.
In the past, Ukrainian was already a world champion of WBO and WBC associations twice.
Unfortunately, nothing that everyone had expected could be done.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 triunfos in 41 professional matches, twice had to be awarded because of his injuries.
Rector Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Arena of Berna, Klitschko, with a stand of 2.02 meters, I wanted to dictate the fight above all with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 inches below, which before the sadness had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was mistaken once and for all of the world's attacks, so Klitschko couldn't take his dangerous diet seriously.
In general terms, passive Johnson made too little for a retreader, and only tried to pass the rounds.
Although I was driving Klitschko with words and gestures, his attacks only rarely reached the world championship.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who set up twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the war, the reactor had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie," which "does not know what to do."
When he was pregnant, the camp was allowed to drive him out of Johnson's sunglasses "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after the return of Klitschko
Also in his fourth battle after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained inviolable.
After almost four years, he won at that time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered his "own" WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without fighting.
That year was later won in his defense of Juan Carlos Gómez, Cuba, and in September Chris Arroola, of the United States.
In this fight I just got a hit, and I'm in a very good physical condition, had explained Klitschko's rapid return to the ring.
But his dream continues to be bringing together all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is a world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to British David Haye, after he destroyed Nikolai Valjev in November, of 2.13 metres of statue.
Last summer, Haye had canceled a war against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
The company that promotes it is planning to fight Klitschko in Wembley, London.
The Kunduz case
The opposition's front attack: the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, lied to the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, because of false information on the issue of Kunduz.
The SPD and the left-hand side require explanation to the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlín – After the most recent air raids on Kunduz, the opposition has challenged the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), who has been deceived by the cause.
In the release of the "Tagesschau" news on Saturday, transmitted by the ARD television channel, the head of the Greens Group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister "in science had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two trucks.
In such a case, it is usually said: he lied.
The order to kill would have been given without regard to the rules of the International Protection Army for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr. Gutenberg had read, said Trittin.
Friday it had been announced that in this attack, not only was the stolen trucks destroyed but also the intentional killing of two Taliban leaders.
In the United States Air Attack, requested by the German Commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
Greens, SPDs and left urged federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately to the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel has to clarify whether an intentional murder strategy is part of the federal government policy of Afghanistan, and if the Chancellor, the Army and the Information Service have adopted this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his green colleague Renate Kunast demanded.
The government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected criticism.
The Chancellor did not exercise any influence on concrete actions by the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday they also raised doubts about the presentation made by the Ministry on the reasons for the expulsion of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and fully about the background of the attack on the trucks.
Officially, they had been said to have denied the existence of NATO reports and had hidden details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials it was reported that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a document of two pages of Colonel Klein, who was under command, and a report of a field patrol.
However, Wichert would have requested a letter clarifying the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgeiner Sontagszeitung".
He hasn't received an answer until now, he said.
The ministry did not show up on the Saturday with regard to the promises made to it, and it pointed out that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's research committee, which would be the next Wednesday.
Onion Worlds
In the state of alertness, some people see images and hear voices that others don't see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental illnesses and drug addicts, there is a gap between imagination and reality.
While it happens during the dream, it's all right.
When we are trapped in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can deliver without any work to the wildest images and creations of fantasy.
However, those who experiment with being like sleep during the watch, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are often viewed in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addicts, or at least as manipulative.
But such images and voices do not only arise from mental illnesses or drugs.
The crime has our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes widening the boundaries between dream, madness and reality.
Warned state-of-the-art states may appear in the most various ways, in the best of the cases we call visions, and in the worst, locus.
Although decadenants and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be attributed to the visions of the Hildegard von Bingen myth, the psychological experiences of the prophet of the New era Carlos Castaneda, the states of the Chamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations.
Alucinations or deliriums arise when the balance of the neuronal substances of communication in the brain – above all dopamine, noradrenalin, serotonin and acetylcolin – has been eliminated and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disturbed.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very often there are complex hallucinations and speechal thoughts.
The gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between lucura and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle designed the hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of surveillance, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatric life, found in 1861 a "great similarity of the state of play with the onyrian states", for Sigmund Freud, even the dream was "a psychosis, with all the disappropriations, accommodation formations, and spying on it".
It's October 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
Its body is of two dimensions and scandalously colored.
The gravity no longer has power over him, is floating near the roof of the room.
He's sitting on a floor.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red muscles such as blood, deformities, washing teeth.
They're stalking him, they're painting him with heavy and flammable boots, they're throwing him over the walls, he's feeling the pain in the whole body.
Strong and evil voices resurface from walls and radio.
You can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. starts two cables from the stereo, takes them off to form an axortic needle, and sets them on a hook on the roof.
He climbs up into a bottle and puts the naked one around the neck.
Salta.
The rope's down.
What a lesson for you!, the voices cry in a choir that the timers return to you, "Go to the clinic and make you look good!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first nearly 20 years ago.
The reason the product was LSD.
Its diagnosis is psychosis schizophrenia-affiliation-paranoid, it is also maniaco-depressive, taking medicines, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
She has learned to live with her illness, she has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible distress and deep despair, he says.
The hallucinations are a cruel reality
About 1 percent of the population falls sick at least once in schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In a acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time the affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the inside, and fall into a state of over-excitement that can lead to hallucinations, deliriums of size, relationship disturbances, or persecution.
Especially extended is the sound of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is filled with impressions.
Like dream, psychosis also opens the computers to a stream of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says the cathedral of Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor of the general psychiatric clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of events, everything has a meaning directed to it.
At the same time, they enter a passive role, like a dream, they feel overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
I've experienced a hallucination once in my life
On the contrary, in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle as such."
Paranoic thoughts and hallucinations are supported in reality, and the distance from experience has taken place in reality.
For researchers, it's still a mystery why our brain makes hairy.
According to Fuchs, exceptions can lead any person to lose contact with reality in a temporary way.
But not all people develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic provision for schizophrenia, but bone marrow studies have shown that in addition to genes there are other determining factors.
Researchers believe that the affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that brain neuronal maturity is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it is still unknown how this neuronal system change occurs, which is also not shown in absolute terms for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or traumatic experience may be the detonators of a psychosis when there is already a previous provision.
Similarly, alucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, since they interact with the brain’s transmission system.
When the brain is warm
The logic of all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says the psychologist Erich Kasten, of Lübeck.
The perception of alucination as acceptable or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die Reale Welt in our Kopf (The Real World in Our Head), published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms accompanying psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are mental disorders such as the limited disorder of personality or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s and craneoencephalitis.
Surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
Alucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are usually repressed.
They occur when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are being processed are hyperactive or are not cohesive; when our brain is warm, but also when they lack incentives.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of incentives, stress, the ill of love or other brain states of exception.
In recent studies up to a third of the respondents had at least once had a hallucination in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and attended a secondary school.
A running girl.
If it wasn't for those pictures and voices.
Sometimes, during the recreation, a boy with long and dark hair directs his word.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one besides her hears or sees the boy.
They think the scared girl is a little strange dreamer, but Sarah K. She knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and she's watching and listening to that boy, just like she sees and hears the girl sitting in the bank next door.
You may even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes it.
Sometimes she's asked if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, appearances are alarming.
Visions are often a load.
When he's in class sometimes he can't follow the lesson because the teacher – his eyes and ears – is presenting a new partner, while for the rest he explains mathematical equations in a visible and hearing way.
At night, appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to arrive, which often comes late and is scarce, he does not know whether he is awake or dreaming, if the images that he sees, the mice or the girl with bleeding cuts in their arms and legs, appear before their eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, call them on the figures.
Your parents and friends didn't tell you anything, they thought it was crazy.
October 2009. Sarah K. She's 20 years old today.
He approved last year's selectivity and lives with his boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations disappeared.
Since you've been in contact online with psychologist Kasten, you know it's not crazy.
Lukura is also a work of art by despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of incentives, it is very likely that after a while he begins to have hallucinations.
I believe that the brain is unemployed and it is the same to seek entertainment.
Sarah K., the only girl, had little fear of other children and often played alone.
Their hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, it was understood that the man who called him Father since he had the use of reason is not his biological father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real and noise impressions, to those affected like Sarah K. They find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "has a place in the brain, the reality is projected there.
The hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, so they look so real."
Kasten also classifies night fantasy as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike the schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their views as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate his hallucinations as a special skill.
Sleep and Allusion Limit
in this world too focused on consciousness, imaginary experiences are generally pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a cathedral in Heidelberg and a medical director at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhouses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious and painful disease but also involves something positive and creative – locura is an art work of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated what is called honesty, a special form of consciousness, which is understood as if it were a dream.
The unique hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them sees them as real and that later he cannot distinguish between being awake.
The unique conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with a trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyrradiculineuropathy, who experience a motor paralysis with full consciousness. die bei vollem Bewussein ene motorische Lähmung Erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of one or more of the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation by a self-imposed and imaginary world that is disconnected from reality.
A form of limited state between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a change of world is taking place, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intense way of giving meaning and interpretation to an inequitable situation in which our own capacity to create enables us to avoid anything from the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The artist Peter Cornelius Clausen, of Zurich, also describes his unique experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience was on trips several days after an operation of heart valves with heart transplants included, while his body was sentenced to immortality at the intensive care station.
Cloassen emerged in a world created by the same and visited strange places of other times: he saw him lying on the bed, a man larger on the side of a sanatorium on a train, a robot stared for his health.
He was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles that produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his country of origin, surfed his hospital bed in the Alps with fine snow and met a Korean mafia.
It does everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these trips are basically different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, so describe your experience.
On the contrary, memories of mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in the irrelevant details.
More clear and intense than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience reveals the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, dishonesty, psychosis, hallucinations and drug abuse show the weakness that is the internal reproduction of external reality, even when we are awake.
Every change in the state of consciousness, according to psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
Children will be responsible for the editorial at the age of 27
The new editor Kallen has come to a temporary solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he commented to SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs at 27 years of age and are firmly willing to enter the company, Burda, 69 years old, confirmed SPIEGEL.
Details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if they are trained for it.
One cannot place before 7,500 workers their children if they are not trained enough to do so.
That would end with the children and also with the company.
Burda told me the Thursday that it will be withdrawn from the presidency of the draft directive and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed successor.
This member of the Kallen family, 52, has been a member of the direction of Burundi since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, he was entrusted with the treasure and thus was responsible for the company’s heritage. After Jürgen Todenhöfer’s exit, he was also responsible for direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family takes over the cover of the editorial.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old. His son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves as "saving the differences of 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With a view to Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda showed that family companies are not apart from the decade: "This has always affected families who are infected by the advance of the capital search, who have judged wrong and thought that they could be raised as well as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had "magnificent deliriums," says Burda.
I don't see myself as a political leader of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play with "Time" in the world league; these businesses have been too big.
Integral Bell
All that--in the matter of beauty and wellness--you can wish, to the extent of your hand.
This seems to have been proposed by the English Court, which just opened up at Callao's commercial centre (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and care of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious signatures such as Hedonai - which is responsible for laser depilation -; Space, with relief rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi pelucheros; Marina d'Or, who owns a gymnasium, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food section, where the theater is highlighted, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while you look at the unforgettable views of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to mount your own 'beautiful party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and taking a camping trip are some of the possibilities that Spaxion offers.
Total are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most recent facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
For example, the cavitation to fight cellulitis or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'trainers' which are leading customer steps, offering them a fully customized treatment.
Everything starts by entering your personal key into a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then several videos show us how to perform our exercise table correctly.
Your director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and wetting) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And if, after exercising our body, we want to pass through the furry, Luis & Tachi company has a room where hair recovery rituals, lightness or personalized nutrition are offered.
Innovation and exclusion seem to have been the prizes of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 in the evening.
Variated hearings
It's about Christmas and it's never gonna be more of a review of the stars' watches to fit them into our party dress.
The shape of the shell, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables we must take into account.
There's a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an excessive and very complicated score. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The Endesa electric company, together with the Barcelona Association, has created the 'LIVE Office'.
This is a project to develop and promote electric vehicle in Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implantation of Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the installation of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements on mobility, managing, coordinating, providing subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, it is intended to promote what will be the transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville joined the project.
They are the three cities selected by the Government within the MOVELE Plan to promote the installation of the electric vehicle.
The Endesa electric company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunia.
It is therefore intended to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in European standardisation groups and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a peace horizon' for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a horizon of peace" for the Spanish automotive industry, which he recalled is the country's main exporter sector.
In the submission of the President of the Government ' s 2009 Economic Report, Zapatero reviewed the measures the Executive has undertaken throughout the year to support the car sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, we would today have a range of leftovers, from the closure of some of our main productive plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the availability of the brands to follow in Spain, in a highly competitive sector, we can have a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our main exporting sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Automotive Plan (IPA), targeted 800 million projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of over EUR 3,000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernising existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed government support measures for demand, in accordance with Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the President, this plan has allowed the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market to be reduced by 6 per cent and has contributed to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased by "about 40 per cent" in November.
20.000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Hall of Classic Vehicle will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and professionals from the mountain of the engine.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Crystal Palace of the Field House of Madrid.
This is an exposure area of 20,000 square metres in which more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can you find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find articles of all kinds related to the engine world.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the palace, accessories, replacements, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, thumbnails, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic motor that will make the pleasure of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies are Classic Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbres, restaurant; Cupe-Francisco Pueche sales and car restoration; or Classic Car, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Tests of competence in the external
In addition, the commercial activities of this Chamber will be completed by parallel activities: concentration, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Tests of skill with classic cars and motorcycles will also be performed in a circuit equipped outside the railway station.
Mazda3 Stop: Sustainable sports
Mazda wants to show that sport is not combined with respect for the environment.
Therefore, it has just incorporated Mazda3 into the engine stop and start -baptised as i-Stop-, a device which is currently only available with the 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is highlighted by the good note reached throughout its entire range.
The finished, the end of the vehicle, the housing, the behaviour, the mechanic, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we check that the front boots present excellent ergonomics and subjectiveness.
Also, the touch of the flight shall be excluded.
Continued with the set formed by the table of instruments and the console we see as Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a future interior design, with a large number of buttons and sleeves and calling colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of which the Honda Civic also presents.
Therefore, we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contrasting with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically Volkswagen Golf, to which all want to fight.
Continued with the living room, this Japanese compact offers a more than sufficient accommodation for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In all of this there is a wide variety of malaria and with regular forms.
The engine stop and autostart system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-litre gasline engine and 150 horses and with the manual six-wheel switch.
This engine is a real delight. It is highlighted by its finish, its reduced noise, its benefits and the achievement of some consumer content.
And it is true that while the most demanding Mazda3 will be diesel versions, those who do not realize a high number of kilometers per year should not discard this i-Stop with a gas engine, both for their high run comfort and for their consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is called Sportive, i.e. which incorporates a larger number of serial elements.
Of the series equipment, it is especially the car exchange assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive internal mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air-conditioning, rain and light sensors, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-pound allelements.
In addition, if you had little equipment, this version would have been included with the Premium Pack, which adds up to 1,500 euros: bixenone adaptations and BOSE sound system with disk loader, among other elements.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best components of the category.
It is particularly highlighted by the quality of the materials employed, by their behaviour and by the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who don't make many kilometers per year can choose by this i-Stop version, which is only associated with the gasoline engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between the EUR 21.770 of the finished Luxury and the EUR 23.270 of the proven version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, Mazda3 will offer us high doses of satisfaction every day.
'First' of July
L. A. covers the red carpet ofsensitivity of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie's hand.
The stars have shone more than ever around in such elegant models as 'sexys' in the 'Nine' field. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', sophisticated as usual, chose by a dark 'lady'.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to view the mail, without even being able to see certain types of attachments or navigate through the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine appointed him one of the products of the year.
To see it across the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly quota, less than half of what is paid, for example, by the iPhone data plan.
In view of the success the company has removed two new devices: one exclusively thought for Twitter, the other with a free live data service instead of paying six more times by Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's just as limited as its counterpartisan American, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, of about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what to do when crossing the border or desperately search for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a background connection) to see the mail.
The idea of a fixed price roaming is incredibly attractive and, in time, it should be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience there is a lack of physical doctorate to understand them and good gafas to read the little letter.
The European Commission's repeated earmarks to achieve affordable roaming rates for all of Europe have only had a significant impact.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and for good reason.
That a device such as FonPeek (not to stop worrying about taking the name of Fon when Wifi is missing) gets this type of tariff means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other Internet consultations.
No contracts and no cash.
It's a connected device and it pays for it when you buy it, not a month.
And that's what I hope to see some day with FonPeek, a purchase option with access to life as Peek already has in the United States.
Not because he's going to buy it.
I look at my e-mail on the phone, thanks.
I hope because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
The amarilla is no doubt the favorite tone of the first lady in the United States.
If he has already attended the holding of Barack Obama as President of the United States with a dress and cover of this color, he has chosen himself to accompany him in his second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has taken a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - green marble with brilliant reflections - twice the action consists of three pieces - dress, jacket and cover of the same screen - and decorated with a large board or collar.
That is how, in a first glance, it seemed that the first lady in the United States was following the style of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat her dress.
But the screen in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If you want to take possession of a fat cup of tea, Oslo is a printed terriopel.
The plugins have also changed: medium-sized green shoes once again, and a similar model, but in the back, now.
And also different is the punishment: a collection on this occasion, melena throws down the previous one.
75 per cent of working mothers have had work problems for their mother
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is how the study 'Factuality and Working Trajectory of Women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women, reveals it.
The survey conducted between 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75 per cent of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences at the beginning of the marriage in pairs and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they are developing.
Those who do not have a job outside of home, work part-time, or have an unstable job, start their marriage first, advance their first motherhood, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are losing their livelihood and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of age with stable work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting the marriage, an increase of 4.1 women with stable employment have taken more time from their vital traction to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed has much influence on maternity, although less on the accompanying calendar," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is one of the factors that distinguish women's age when they get married and have the first wedding.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the older the age they get married and the older they have the first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those with primary and upper secondary studies have been mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 averages, respectively.
"A further division among women is established according to their level of studies.
While those who have elementary studies marry and have their first child before they get a stable job, the average or higher levels invest in this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a condition prior to marriage and the arrival of a child," Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
The Paris Oréal just added a new name to his distinguished list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become an image of different brand products, enthroning the universal theme of 'Why I Valgo'.
The protagonist of 'Joeux Noël', one of the most elegant actors of the international panorama, joins other famous figures of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were the actors Evangeline Lilly ('Perididos') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
In the male apartment, the cosmetic brand also includes luxury embassies: Patrick Dempsey ('Anatomía de Grey') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'Peridos').
British Fashion Awards
The British have much to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - gathered in the annual delivery of their prizes, which was held in London, the Royal Court os Justice.
No one's missing the date.
The former Jerry Hall model and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, is chosen Best Year's Model.
Manuel Vicent's Poker
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Poquer de aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) a thirty-year-old writer's radiographs that have passed through his literary life (and, in some cases, also by the other).
It does not do so in predictable and frightening generations (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeking something similar to the core of ignition of the creative personality.
The trip has its excitement and Vicent does not save noise or lighting.
In addition to a pleasant exclusive, the book is a moving invitation to reading and reading.
Here I gave them some moments.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea but a spiritual, almost physical, the same thing I felt without giving him a name: pleasure against fate, innocent morality and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nilist, happy Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the mind, between impotence and ignorance, with a shining poetic smile, without any sense, like the sheet of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man has been kidnapped by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirty years, in which his flesh combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of revenge, a spiritual privilege consisting of reaching heaven through the road of loss."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulisis' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which has to be scaled by the northern wall, from which the best alpineists once and for all."
About William Faulkner: "It was a rare guy.
On his own, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a condo owner and others who were the son of a black man and a cocodril.
Both dreams were of greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the scream slowly released from a bridge by that character of Munich to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century under his literary form and made it on a journey running from himself and calling for the posteriority with a violent speech to the Gusan."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day I got rid of my wheelchairs and prayed, 'Dear God, please let me stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb these verses were recorded by Spencer: "The dream after the effort,/after the storm of the port,/the rest after the war,/after the heart of life is satisfied with death."
About Virginia Wolf: "The team also brought their depressions.
The husband accepted with all the frequency that she told him that Eduardo VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
The case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was going ahead of his mind."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inculcate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try to pass to Baroja by the arms of Faulkner?
What did Cela do but get the reputation of that man so that he could serve him as a pedestal?"
Coward Aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother passed through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenblarada when a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed along with her and our dog, an example of mixed race, rescued from the dog and not more than six kilos of weight and without a word, they owned two potatoes left to the injured dog.
Our anger is mauscula because we do not find entertainment in a free aggression to a small and defenced animal, which, of course, was found attracted.
This must be added to the sophomore that caused a woman who passed quietly and who, when she urged these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energy attack on an animal is able to do so herself with a woman, a child, an elder or, finally, with any weaker person than he himself.
The event took place at five o'clock in the afternoon of a Tuesday by any traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
Of course, we filed a complaint in a nearby commission that we doubt that it serves for a lot and not to generate susceptibility, just to make it clear that the murder squads were Spanish.
Anger has led us to accuse this fact.
We don't understand what's going on among the young people so they think it's fun to treat a harmless animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have been left.
Michelin and Fesvil together by using the casco
The neumatics manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of cassus, mainly among the younger motorists, informed both entities today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the helmet, since it is the only element of protection capable of avoiding injuries in the head or even death in the case of an accident while driving.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of his commitment to civil security, which "will go beyond design and manufacture products every day more secure" and stated that it also contributes to this goal by means of other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new boosting campaign for the use of the helmet on the motorcycle, under the heading 'To be or not to be', will have a first stage in which cards will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
In conclusion, Michelin pointed out that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since as a neummatic manufacturer for two wheels vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop more and more safe products.
Go up to the sale of light commercials
Nearly two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units that were matrixed in November in Spain accounted for a rise of 12.6 per cent in 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from Anfac and Ganvam vendors' pattern.
The good data, which is not surprising, should be put into account because the reference to which the comparison was made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60 per cent over the previous year.
As a result, despite the response of the last month, the matrices accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95.853 units have been sold together with all vehicles that make up the light commercial sawmill: tourist products, pick up, vans, light wagons and trucks/light chassis.
Also, no one has disappeared from the more expensive nouvelles, since although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay almost 100 per cent of the cases through external funding.
In order to address the restrictions imposed by the closed grip on bank credits, other factors such as the increase in stock levels or the persistence of the poor economic situation must be taken into account.
In front of this panorama and in contrast to tourism, there has been little support for the purchase of 2000E.
In addition to the private, autonomous and pymes that are going to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, the number of operations has been witnessed.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled the need to devote special attention to these vehicles and also to industry (cars and buses).
The sales association predicts a 2010 like the year it ended, which calculates a fall in sales (from tourism and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already required
As was the case with the ABS brake block and will pass on the stability control of the ESP, emergency brake aid systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, it is already in all small commercial vehicles and new registration vehicles, while for the rest there is a period of absence until the end of February 2011.
The measure imposed by the European Union aims to increase the protection of petons, although it can also help to avoid many collisions by means of their work.
The emergency brake assistant is doing more pressure on brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver's gun.
But this doesn't always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of components for Bosch car, the third part of drivers involved in an accident had not come to weigh the brake before the collision and half of them did not use all the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in turn, requires maximum braking system, reducing the distance the car uses to stop.
According to one EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of element, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving petons could be avoided annually.
The reduction will be even more - it is calculated that one of the four sinisters would avoid injury to people - when so-called smart emergency braking systems are popular.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which (through a radar or a camera) detects the obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, help him increase pressure on the pedal if necessary.
In case it does not react, and although collision is inevitable, the device makes the greatest effort to minimize damage to the brakes.
General Motors delayed until January the plan for Opel
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - the 8th - according to a report by Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warns that more time will be needed to complete the Opel recovery plan.
What Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, hopes is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this can make the final document that will be submitted to workers first and then to the Governments of the countries in which they have factories will be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, since GM, it is ensured that a decision on Saab's sale should be taken in the next few days.
This is not surprising what the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM accepts contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but strongly supports the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, which is supported by the Russian Converg group.
If there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to the Baic China.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year shall be maintained if it is not sold.
To the Volcano of Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its last, and towards joy, Porsche engineers took the S Boxster as the basis and managed to extend nothing less than 80 kilograms, which has left the bascule in just 1.275 kilograms.
This led them to first step away from the automatic roof that has been provided by one of the canvas with manual action, which saves 21 kilos; using aluminium doors such as the GT3, 'caen' other 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel storage of 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilograms more; mounting other 12 sports bags and with 19 light bulbs, five.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system brought another six kilograms and changing the door triggers by one of the screens, the remaining kilogram.
Although it is also offered with the double shoulder PDK change, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly by secondary streets of California, in mountain trout with real-reversed trails
Its behavior can only be regarded as incapacitable.
The weight reduction does not mean that the car did not break the asphalt with aploma.
On the contrary, it was a long time ago that we were not testing a model so small and light that once it transmitted so much security in the course of the curve, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in a short walk for the time being needed, until we order him to print, to freeze, to recover and reexpress his engine...
What we ask for, thanks to its direction, as well as its communication as necessary, what we say with our hands on the flight is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with a surgical precision.
Custom engine sound
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be powered with the 'sport' option and through a system that changes the brake of the engine, already previously trained in Panama.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from stop to recovery.
Suspension is strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the streets that we passed through with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car was good-looking.
Electronic aid only made an act of presence throughout the driveway; and that in some of the curves we find ice at noon and gravel, it's already in the morning.
Finally, an ultrasound car of the most fun to drive that one can on the market and that is something more than a simple change of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, at a price of EUR 70,831.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate by Karl Lagerfeld, picture of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlet' of the 'maison' files, the singer produces his evil face with as much contusion as his Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
A Victory in Israel
The Laboral Caja reached a bright triumph for 82-91 on its visit to the complicated corner of Maccabi Electric, despite the many lows with which Dusko Ivanovic's team was counted, and this is how it is located in the leadership of his group, following the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, which with eight triples recorded was the best of his team (29 rating).
The winning team intends to provide the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mikov with high rates of involvement and collective work, although it had to endure to the end in order to win.
In addition, the great aqueduct from the perimeter, with 16 annotated triples, had much to do with the final triunfo.
The party began face to face the blues, which had been placed from the beginning in front of the marker.
That the first four canasts of the winners were from the perimeter had already predicted that they had jumped to the Israeli cane with the hot mussels.
English and Teletovic were the main artists from 18 to 20 at the end of the first part.
The second room was more than the same, but the team then chose by the inner game of Barak and Elijah's work, which was received with pits and applause on the return to his home, to continue extending his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic had already begun to highlight as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'minimum six' of Splitter' evaluations already claimed that it wasn't the best night in Brazil.
But the party, despite being involved in the rest, was not even much less determined and the Maccabees wanted to remind the winners that they didn't win anyone, and with 'Elijah'' they opened their hand and they managed to get into the party.
Eidson and Pnini have made a decisive contribution to the return of 'marillos' to the light (50-49).
More Inconsistency
Ivanovic's wounded but not much less dead, needed to hold a couple of real-time players to catch air, and in these came Mirza Teletovic's methralator, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a quieter income (54-67), which they managed to make the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The prisoners went out to leave their skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) had already warned that they would not be let anyone take away what they had deserved for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not re-sign and tried to keep their team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter removed by mistake, the Ivanovics did not precipitate, defend themselves well, and although the Israelites approached the final minute (80-85), the party had already owned and the victory had escaped from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
The injuries prevent the battle against Unicaja
The Unicaja lost almost in Greece before the Olympics and gave it to the leader of Eurolagic Group B, at a party marked by the lower castes, especially in the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagasy team was not afraid of the environment of the Palace of Peace and Friendship and not of the rival entity, perhaps of Europe's most powerful and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first room allowed you to dream of the parallels. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of the Omar Cook base and one of Guillem Rubio's, highlighted the locations 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympics were surprised by the intensity of Unicaja , although the arsenal of the locals in the internal game with Bourousius, Vujcic and Schortsanitis gave him the return to Marker 22-20, 13 minutes when an action, contacting war, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, was assumed to be disqualified by both players.
The Greek whole began to function by showing its superiority within both areas, where the low byearm English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal faults were binding on the priests.
Between the inner players and the Lithuanian Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, min 19.
Impossible to retrieve
The third period was very offensive to the Olympics, which, despite the 19 losses, was shown to be superior and even reached the difference between the meeting held in Málaga 66-48, minutes 27 which made the group leader miserable.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last down from the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the inconveniences, the Unita by Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left something of hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympics when they were picked up and given their height in centimetres within the area proved improbable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to re-mount the basketball adventure 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja resigned, delivering the leader to the Olympics.
How much should you cover for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the pay they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Find, the search engine with more classified ads of real estate, employment and engine in Spain.
The tool How Should You Cover? calculates user salaries from more than 140.000 job offers available in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week when the application is in operation, the searcher has found that in general the Spanish worker "is feeling poorly paid", explained in a communiqué to Trovit's product manager, Albert Ribera.
According to the data provided by their researchers in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the most paid.
A British computer programmer covers €45.226 gross annual and one French, 31.059, against the 24,000 who receive a Spanish.
In the same way, a driver costs €34,247 per year net in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is gambling, with €11,592 net annual; followed by the dependent, with €14,725; and the operator, with €15,667.
The most sought-in jobs in the network in the last three months are driver, average daily employment and social worker.
Brazil dates Zelaya's exit
The Brazilian Government has extended to Manuel Zelaya's stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The depositary shall resign the diplomatic League by 27 January 2010 at the latest when its term of office is officially completed.
Francisco Catunda, responsible for the business of Brazil's embassy in the Hungarian capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he remains refugees from 21 September.
"He has a conscience that he must leave on 27 January, when he has completed his mandate, he must seek another destination."
The station also mentioned the former commander, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline set: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said via telephone.
After the elections on 29 November (which resulted in the election of Porfirio Lobo), Zelaya made sure that she would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week she tried to find refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by Zelaya's rejection of the political asylum condition that he claimed to impose on him by the Government "in fact" that President Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since the spring in which the inflation of assets has been dominant in the markets, uncertainty once again comes back to the markets, which should not be strange since it is its natural state, in an environment where the agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by the central banks to stabilize the markets was currencyed with direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving a free-of-liquidity bar to near-zero types so that financial entities can buy assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been practically completed and, without any question of their heterodox liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand into the savings as the ECB has done with its deficit in the coming week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are assisting in a revision of the risk premium reduction.
The volatility of the Bolsa and the differences in corporate benefits have returned to reflect, although they are very far from the abnormal levels reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was re-affected.
Once again there is a high-quality flight and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, leading to an increase in the differences between euro area countries in relation to Germany.
Spain had only been affected by this instability episode but at that time it came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new review of the fall of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, there is no doubt that it is wrong to close up moral risk defenders who have tried to re-establish awareness of global economic policy officials because they have undermined the destructive effects of the restriction of credit on the destruction of employment, when what should be done is to decree a new day of Thank you.
However, what Dubai has done is a tribal struggle between the migrants to recompensate power in the Empresses and what Greece has already seen.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls off the coin.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It does not mean that Ecofin saves Hungary from failure to comply with its external payments at the beginning of the year and that it will allow a euro Member State to fulfil its commitments.
What is logical is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and accountable to its citizens for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are facing an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after some overruns in advanced positions, it would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt are increasing, we should not worry about the European corporate benefits.
If the European differences are decreasing and ours are still expanding, then it would be a risk of Spanish idiosyncrascrasy.
The Standard & Poor's is an anaecdotal. When our advanced indicators are obliged most of the study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their 2011 scenario, including the OECD and the European Commission, which return to the task with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not open up a lot of hope of life to its warning.
Again, it has all the painting that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "wisdom, driving friend".

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the Conference of the MPs' Sub-Committee in which Spain's energy strategy is being discussed these days in the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by the President of Natural Gas-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some of what he had planted in the subcommission at the closed door.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 million euros by 2020 and another 60,000 million between that date and 2030, provided that nuclear power stations are now in operation.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95 billion.
Yes, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be intended to increase capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and in international interconnections.
Since 2020, the issue has changed and will have to increase power.
Its aperture focuses on both gas and carbon plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, he considers that there are 18,000 new MWs, that is, with other "support energy".
Galan, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act which has just been approved by the Government is in line with what his company has come to claim, did not want to do blood with the real decree to encourage the consumption of national carbon, which is contrary to the policy of combating climate change.
In its opinion, there is "a clear long-term delay" in this regard, despite the "pointal" measures, as the President of Iberdrola called them.
Whatever the case, Galan believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must be started because they are already late in growing up and a stable framework is needed to address them.

Share your first bus route in Australia with Hochtif and Bouygues
Action fights for its first concession bus in Australia, a market where it already works as a water and energy company.
The work in play is the one estimated at $1,700 million in Australian dollars (EUR 1,047 million).
The French Bouygues and Sister Hochtief are their rivals.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the nearest option for Actiona to sit in the country as a construction and concessionary bus.
The City Council wants to have it on its way to the end of 2014
After choosing for public-private collaboration (PPP for its signals in English) to move forward the project, in a business plan protected by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to work with and exploit the lead.
Waiting for their bids to be submitted in the next month of May, the planned investment rose to $1,700 million in Australia (EUR 1,047 million) and in the last phase, they competed with three associations with a significant presence of European builders.
The group baptized as Transcity is led by Actiona, the only Spanish in canvas, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, located in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the team of Actiona plays the Northern Direct Consortium, with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction team Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the strike is the so-called LBRJV, where Australian Leighton (the company of the German builder Hochtief), the local Baulderstone (the property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the specialized Gala signature in Razel civil work.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatizations, but it presents a clear difficulty in entering if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has followed the so-called Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and continues to be a pending assignment for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% participation in Hochtief, owner of the so-called Leighton.
Millions active
It acts by a geographical area of maximum importance for the sector, in which it has already highlighted its presence through its activity as a energy provider and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest organic park, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies to raise and manage Adelaide's desalator, with a budget of 700 million.
Its purpose is now to consolidate these two areas and use synergies to enter the construction and operation fields.
The underground pedestrian road, promoted by the City of Brisbane Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (Northern Link), is called to join the western road from Toowong with the railway circuit in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 km of tunnel. This is the largest operation to reduce congestion in the Brisbane road.
The schedule marked by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the work in December of the following year.
Although this payment step would open up traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed by 2016.
The tunnel began to design in 2005.
It will include two means of transport, an electronic footing system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) to its financing.
Brisbane offers business and Hochtif
Australia continues to produce significant fruits to Hochtief, which announced yesterday the acquisition of a contract with the Government estimated at 154 million.
The participation of ACS will enable, through its local branch Lighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with optical fiber cable.
This action will offer fast Internet access to 400,000 people and will give German work for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has transferred the construction project of King George Tower, of 27 plants, to the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still under way and Hochtief has closed the sale in 129 million.
Already in the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.

More than 63 million in France Télécom to slow down competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Telecom by anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited fixed and mobile telephony competition with the signing of exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programmes to consumers outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and state company still collects more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 to put work on its competitors.
The punishment has, in fact, been increased because the authority which is in charge of competition considers France Télécom to have committed similar offences in the past and is therefore reciprocity.
Application Store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile branch has followed the style of other operators and has opened an Internet application shop, with the aim of increasing non-voting revenue.
In principle, Orange will be active in France and the United Kingdom.

Play the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and the Barca since its origin
The League of Champions has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
Both, that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth clubs that have won more money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Championships League is not only a source of glory. It is also one of the main sources of income from large clubs.
Thus, the competition has distributed EUR 5.362.5 million to 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created in 1992/1993, according to the UEFA data.
The Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have been well stopped out of this department.
The white club has been the third of the continent where more money has been paid for participation, and the only one, along with AC Milan, has won three times the trophie.
The Catalan, the current champion and the final winner of the Great Cup of Europe in 1992, is the fifth of the classification.
The list will be led by the Manchester United and Munich Bayern, the two teams that also invoiced more money by participating in the past League of Championships.
And that, despite losing both of them in front of the Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has won more money through the Championships, although it has won more titles than anyone else (five, four from Italy, three from England and two from Germany).
Distribution
This paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure applied by the EAFRD.
For this period, the agency that President Michel Platini plans to enter 1,090 million by the Champions League.
From this money, UEFA will devote 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs participating in the previous classification round (including the Madrid Athletic) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million only because they were there, as well as other 550,000 euros per party in question.
There are also bonuses for winning (EUR 800,000) and for empacing (400,000 for each team). Octavofinists will earn three million each; eight quadruphinists, 3.3 million.
The last four will pay 4 million each.
The campaign will win 9 million, against the 5.2 million finalist.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barca, on the other hand, paid 2.5 million for winning the European Superscope in August.
But there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportion value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the mains, and it has four assigned seats.
The previous year's campaign is based on 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party shall be paid in accordance with the number of parties to be played in the edition of this year.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros per 29.9% of Sos
The New Rumasa Group outlined yesterday the details of the sale of shares with which it seeks to acquire a peak of 25 per cent and 29.9 per cent of Sos' capital.
A percentage which does not force you to launch a public procurement offer (opa) for the whole of the securities.
In particular, New Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 for action that would be disbursed in 10 years and would be paid with interest for this 1% annual delay
Yesterday's actions closed to €1.85; New Rumasa's offer cost the company 18% under the market.
According to New Rumasa, the price of EUR 1,50 reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The group gives a 15-day period for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CMMV ensured that the offer had not been informed, although Ruiz Matthews' company stated that it had contacted the regulator.
In order to achieve this, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when Sos capitalization is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, His continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to stay behind from possible purchase offers and from their former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit.
A decision to turn it into the first woman who has a high role in the food business.
This is a new creation post that will depend directly on the group's president.
And he is not exempt from polygamy, as the company continues to engage in the legal battle for the alleged deviation of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, you can't just disappear over the next few months.
With regard to the Salazar credit, yesterday the former consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernández Noriega (CCM representatives and Unicaja) in the National Audit announced yesterday that they had approved the 212 million deployment without knowing their destination.
The CMMV authorizes the parentine exclusion opium presented by Inversora Mer
The National Commission of the Valores Market (CNMV) authorized yesterday the closing opium presented by Inversora Sea on Federico Paterina on 9 October.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorises this operation to understand that its terms are in accordance with the applicable rules and to consider the contents of the explanatory note submitted after the amendments introduced last 2 December.
The CMMV has indicated that the offer is directed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares by Federico Paterina at a price of 7,65 euros per share, representing 895% of its social capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading in the Bolsa de Madrid and Bilbao.
It has also explained that 5,592.778 million shares have been mobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the tender has been finalised, which has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paterina, in accordance with the provisions of the existing legislation.
New car rental tools
In these days of times and accidents, they don't just win the car workshops.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a syndicate are reimbursed to a workshop, where a expert must assess the damage suffered and what will be the cost of repair.
No synister is equal, and the calculation of the cost of pieces and working time can be a long and complicated work.
Calculatedly the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including human work parts, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the most recent IT tools, it would be a minor issue.
As a result, nearly 100% of experts use this type of system.
The service providers and maintenance assessment and solutions are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, to further develop it and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audadex, of the North American Solera group, is the leader's signature; about 80% of the ratings are made with their products.
The other firms that compete in the field of charging and information processing tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is very simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audadex's trade director, Spain works with 63 manufacturers and importers, each providing information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be tried does not stop increasing, until there have been several versions, variants and motorizations in the last five years.
As a new car is on the market, these companies are forced to work.
It is a very expensive job, because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle must be catalogued and put in their price.
In addition, each model produces a "intellectual" graphic image where different parts of tourism can be "pinchar".
If it is a winding-up model, the work can be ready in a week if the process is going very fast.
If it is a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audadex has full information about 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models are information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
With regard to the mobile park surrounding it, they exceed 99%.
To carry out documentation and database development work, Audadex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the U.S., Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technical (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audadex invests 90 million euros annually in developing these databases.
Every month 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to use different uses and offer different products.
The most common use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries also have tools for handling waste or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide reporting on the value of users in Spain is Eurotax.
Audadex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audadex, it is easy to make an idea of the type of support that can be provided to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard solution for evaluation of sinisters, for experts.
It includes light or heavy motor vehicles, motor vehicles and industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the pieces, include repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint bars.
This tool is paid according to usage for each valuation.
The highest cost is €5.75 for low-use customers, a maximum of 10 times a month.
After each insurance company, which makes thousands of losses, negotiates its price with Audadex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it emerged from the assembly line only with its number of containers.
AudaGlass focuses on the vehicle moons, and AudaSubbastas is an open service to the Internet professional sector that allows for the ride by the vehicles declared total synergy.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analyses or know deviations by model marks.
For example, how many models of a certain brand have been passed by the workshop because of accidents or how many serious sinisters have suffered during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It commercializes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Insa group founded in 1971 as a service provider and repair of damages, property or maintenance of the car
The Gt Taxation Guide is its historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased at an annual rate of 20% in the last three years, and in 2008 it has accounted for €10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year they began their internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audadex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38% remain in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The Global Billing of the Solar Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informationex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, a 3.3 per cent more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will invest 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1,000 million in Bolsa, and now its shares amount to a total value of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, she has participated in the New York Box and is included in the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Subsidised by the Internet of Accidented Cars
Last October the Solera group bought AutoOnline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars as motor vehicles or special vehicles.
The operation was financed by EUR 59.5 million by 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended to the remaining 15% year.
The objective of the acquisition was to provide more value-added services to their customers, with the possibility of accessing a vast international market.
This valuation and purchase service is directed exclusively to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, pension companies, workshops, discounts and professional sellers that must be registered before the start of operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and managed over 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The web currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
3,000 daily ads are managed and some 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose number has been given down cannot be returned to circulation, but can be used as a replacement for certain parts that are not damaged.
The cars with historical value can be given up even if they have been given down after some very expensive operations.
Budget to take four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a budget in only four steps: identifying the vehicle, looking for the change, creating the budget and generating the budget.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who are more or less often more responsive to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 tourism, 109 totals, 137 motorcycles, 78 trucks and 44 trucks.
