The tribe of right-wing peoples in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceived weakening of both parties in the great coalition and this marked strengthening of the right-wing People's Party have led, according to the first preliminary results, to the early Sunday parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), within which the position of current President Wilhelm Moreer is seriously vacillate, has suddenly lost a particularly strong one.
On the contrary, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Vice-President of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing the triumphal return to national policy.
According to the provisional results, the country's strongest party remains the socio-democratic (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, compared to the last elections in 2006, but 5.5%.
Even worse it went for ÖVP, which loses 25.6% of the votes almost 9%.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in the Austrian history of the Postwar and, above all, the literal catastrophic result of the populace, which have caused early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the peoples had a great advantage in their preferences before SPÖ.
But the voters obviously punished them for making the government worse.
Already in the first reaction to the results there have been speculations about the possible resignations of the party president, Vice-President Wilhelm Monterer.
The observers believe that Monday may already occur during the extraordinary call of the party's management.
This development may have to facilitate the path towards the most likely way out of the electoral result, i.e. the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
With regard to the strengthening of both right-wing and liberal populist parties (FPÖ) they had previously won 18% and BZÖ 11% of votes - but socio-democratic people had expressed concern about another 1999 when the populists agreed with the peoples to the collective government (the FPÖ was still united in 2005 and BZÖ was separated from BZÖ) which had been a motive for sanctions by the European Union.
On this evolution, Haider is obviously playing, which has already stated that it is ready to work with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national policy.
In Parliament it has also been able to enter the Green Party which has fallen slightly, falling between the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth.
No other party has obviously exceeded the threshold of 4% and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it failed to solve the problem with the hidden scientists who were accused of illegal collection of scarabs in India, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, according to the Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs, would have a certain freeze on the Czech-Indian reports.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it didn't resolve, then you would have a certain freeze," he said after the meeting that took place under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that the executive power can easily interfere with legal proceedings.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was charged and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local in Dardjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee it would be better, for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, to appeal to a higher court.
Then you can ask for exemption on bail and wait for the sentence to be released.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner was expressed in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommended the appeal to the Supreme Court and then it will be possible to obtain grace," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way in which the Czech party can enter the petition is to provide the defendant with "competent legal support", he supported the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that the Indian side is already being supported by a kind of support.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been with India for many years.
The Indians also approve it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, his partner stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of blind entomologists.
"We really consider it a serious mistake to recruit and accuse these blind scientists," he said.
The Minister refused to answer the question whether he had received the promise to take care of the matter from the Indian side.
"I've got so many promises," he just found.
A German judge in the battle for the marine funds
It is close to the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and adjacent maritime areas are drawn.
But it's not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together lies the marine fundamental adjacent.
The area is as large as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 UN Division workers for ocean issues and maritime rights.
His head, the Czech Director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exhibition and everything adds something.
Dominate the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The marine fund is still a little known world of natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other mineral materials, but even living organisms unknown to date have the key to discovering anticancer medicine within themselves.
The largest base of the farm
The coastal states began to take an interest in the sub-seasonal territory.
According to the OSN Convention, the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is particularly true of the area of the so-called continental platform, which often extends up to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the state concerned.
According to the Convention, there is an exclusive right over all the resources of the continental platform.
"In a few words for continental platforms, that part of the marine bottom and its subsoil is meant to be a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic area extends beyond the territorial sea often over 200 thousand nautical miles," explains Mikulka.
The request for the country to submit to the Commission for the definition of the sizes of the continental platform must be accompanied by a very broad technical and scientific documentation based on many cost surveys and measurements.
It is the result of preparation for many years.
"One of our tasks is to seek legal and technical assistance from the Commission.
The Commission has so far dealt with 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three named have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
Australia's recent success which has greatly expanded its marine assets has recorded a global echo.
But the New Zealand also won us - the surface of the marine fund, which was assigned to it by the Commission last week, of about 1.6 square kilometres so more or less six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested in millions of dollars.
The profit, which will produce it in the future from the marine funds, as they promise will be priceless.
Others have also gradually submitted their requests.
They can do so for ten years since "the Montego Bay Convention" has been ratified.
Where the continental platform ends, the ocean fund area begins which the Convention has declared a common heritage of humanity."
No one's got an exclusive position right now.
The right to extract in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Marine Fund isn't Klondikee," says Director Mikulka, exaggerating the fact that its individual parties are legally demarcated and their regime established contractually."
The Secrets of the Pacific
A part of the marine fund belongs to the Czech Republic today.
If it divides it with other states of the former Soviet block in the area of the common organisation "Interoceanmetal".
This was acquired in 1991 under the Convention, as did investors from a few other states, the status of so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right to extract in the area ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Ocean extended between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and a little larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is fragmented, it's almost a subtle repeat of Taty.
"It is possible to extract on the total surface of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich collection of polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the Division of Macedonia Rober Sandev brings with him an expert to show him.
It looks like a small patata or with a bit of fantasy, a legendary scheme, like in the legend of Golem's awakening.
German special units were present at the liberation of the obstacles
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of obstacles – experts arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
In the context of the release of the 11 secession European barriers, more and more detailed information was available.
On the rescue operation as mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Interior, special German units participated.
In addition to the military specialists, the GSG9 units, the aviation federal police, the federal criminal office as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution were present.
As the spokesman of the Ministry of Monday evening spoke, the German units were not involved because the kidnappers, given the danger of an intervention by force, had released the hostages running away.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by the Germans to join them as direct assistance on the ground.
"We haven't arrived for luck," says a spokesman from the Ministry of the Interior.
Aggressors kidnapped on September 19 in the south of Egypt a group of passengers: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as 8 Egyptian accompanyers.
After the raid in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Ciad.
The identity of the kidnappers until the end is kept secret as well as the details of the release or possible redemption payments.
Freedoms in the past have come under good conditions in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not explain the details of the release.
There were no information in Berlin for when they were returned to Germany.
According to the "Build" newspaper, the 5 vacationers and special units should start flying with an Airbus of military aircraft and arrive on Tuesday in Germany.
US representation room rejects the rescue package.
The first room of the US Congress just failed the 700 billion savings package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones is down.
With 206 votes to 227, the US representative home rejected the government savings package for financial markets.
Despite the calls made by US President George W. Bush and first-time politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme, with which the financial markets had to be undermined.
In a dramatic action, the supporters desperately tried to persuade the critics of the massive $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, encouraged the MEPs to agree, even if the plan was unpopulated.
8. It is difficult to recognize something, which has not yet been reached..
While the Dow Jones was in the process of suffering, more than 6 per cent or 600 points were broken.
The reason for investors' concerns was that the State rescue package could have failed.
It took place before the end of the vote, then, after the announcement of the vote, to roll again.
Experts now expect other serious turbulence on international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it is necessary that it should benefit both the House of Members and the Senate.
The promoters record increasing booking figures
It looks like it'll be a good winter for German tourist operators:
According to one study, the rate of travel bookings for the next few months compared to the previous year is increased clearly - for the winter season of more than 30%.
Despite the weak sights of conjugation, the desire to travel from Germany to an investigation remains valid.
On bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded an additional 31 % invoice compared to the same period of the previous year , as the German association for tourism DRV announced in Berlin on Monday .
According to the survey of the GfK Market Research Institute, there are already increased booking rates for the autumn months.
Therefore, the surplus of travel agencies for October 2007 compared with 2007 would be around 11%, reported the DRW.
These results are expected to be the figures of the GfK, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and sets statistical projections for the entire market.
It would also include travel bookings made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the poor dollar ratio, in particular the travel requirements in the United States, DRW referred to.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about one third.
There would also be travel facilities specifically required by the Germans Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as internal premises in Germany.
In particular, all the trips covered have a high proportion, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Given the increasing costs for energy and food species, the costs in this case would be "better calculated for customers than for an individual organised holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among other things, discounts for bookings made with strong anticipation or offers, including Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, as compared to the previous year, there would have been a change in the invoice - even if according to a further study the number of Germans who made a trip, compared to the previous year, has failed.
My first time at October
Ballermann hits, beer from a litre and vip in Dirndln gripped.
Start at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I have actually not very much in common.
She's a blonde, television moderater and wears a Dirndl made on a scale.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, is for us: just 3 minutes at Wiesn, the photographs are already being launched against us and take photos until the memory of the camera – very luxurious, and this on my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how our friends make themselves.
The Dirdle of Two Money seems to achieve its purpose.
As a tourist from Wiesn and an actual resident in the north of the white salsica equator, the sense of well-being in dress/advised up to this day remains within the limits.
And instead of once arrived at Theresienwiese, then there's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears the Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks uncomfortable or uncomfortable – everything is perfectly normal.
Only my Dirdl's grembule collects strange views at the banana stand at the chocolate.
A monacense makes me realize that I would have pulled the grembile in the wrong way: "You're free on the left, you're on the middle of six virgin, you're on the right, behind the veil."
Suddenly, I'm going to have my left-hand back-to-left flow.
It's okay," he says and laughs.
Others make smaller sprays of flitt subtils and wear caps of fur, on which the chapter "To drink to get dressed!" reads the dither naked against an invited person.
The boy with exhibitionist tendencies is named Bob, from England and he also visits the Octoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous" with a narrow ooooo.
This tells me, after he got rid of his beer mouth from a litre he drank before.
Right next to one of these hydrants, of which everyone thinks is a pattumier.
In sum, Bob is one of these family members "Wildbieesler".
Others are not lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At 8:00 p.m., the healers walk white on the festival's square, which must be occupied by the poor bees.
Nurses are always accompanied by white – always 4 times they cross a bar of tent coverings in tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: it's empty, it's back full.
Whoever rides under the telon in this bar of alcohol in the blood, you can't see.
"They are die, whose goarnimmer pack," one of the nurses screams me out in the baronda.
Victim of an incident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in a hospital after being invested in a vehicle while walking to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in town.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but she died shortly afterward.
After the incident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with the charge of ill-treatment.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is expanding diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, European powers were eager to enter the Turkish interior.
On the east side of the Bosforo, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, is one of the most beautiful remnants of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-innascimental style.
This is at least what tourists tell you.
The building is on horseback between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world as some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is a trap.
The whole building is slightly decadent.
But once inside the ticket office from the ceiling at times, there is no doubt about the size of the company that was the most to the west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German Consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a latecomer in the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this railway that ran in Damascus, Baghdad and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
But the imperial ambitions of Germany disappeared during the first world war.
His railways will be attacked by Lawrence d'Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed.
British and Dominican forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there were bad news about Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a munition train exploded by destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then it has slowly gone into disrepair, largely over from history.
But today, this railway gap for Anatolia and all the east points serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's increasingly large diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the freezing borders of the Cold War, has passed.
There is now a new commitment policy.
Notably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian facies of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to appreciate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a train sleeping for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main experts in the AKP, Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a foothill race along the tracks that produced the fates from the ancient world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, they arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to turn their backs on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary move in the Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspects in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the general district of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built at hoc - in a basement along the way of development, surrounded by commercial centers built up and pastries of power, where managers in complete business - both men and women - meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a central-right policy from almost every other political party in Europe.
I'm sure I had a Blackberry too.
"The aim of the foreign policy party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
The cold war was an anomaly," he says.
Turkey was cut out of its territory.
Today he has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case of one or the other.
They must be both.
"But certainly at some point, "I ask, will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "he doesn't want to face that choice."
It then points out that almost all those I have talked about here have recalled: not only the links with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are of benefit to Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can metaphorically cross those rail lines to the east through Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentleman Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had seen this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised it would be to find that Europe's medium-to-oriental ambitions can now be, in large part, in the hands of Turkey.
And while I look at the terminal for the tragedy that brings me back through the Bosforo, I remember that in those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
At least then there seemed to be no doubt about which continent should advance pressure on this fascinating country.
White reminder: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown wrote: as Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, September 11th) had the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his municipal music scheme, the following year he founded his wonderful young choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be under-21/ below 21, but when Proteus sang his final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-changing) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to face everything the music presented to do, whether it was magical or the Messiah, without accompanying or with the whole orchestra.
Musical versatility produced by such a young core was often surprising, always exciting, and was all due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
How often Tod told us "let it be the music to talk for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
There's everything in the music.
That's why I sing it!"
Its technique in use of the package was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial or flowery.
Whatever was the musical standard, it made it ever higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you had to appoint a knight, a director would have been Vernon Handley.
You know it very well during the two decades leading to Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years I have been looking at more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been in conflict with one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated orchestra leaders who, in his words, simply "were riding around the world one or two well-known battle horses".
He'll miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your neurology by William Woodruff (September 25, 1946) specified that "in 1946 he stopped studying economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a course in science, one in letter and one in PhD".
This comes from Woodruff's author's note in Beyond Nab End, but it's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, during which he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the United States as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 I permanently left Nottingham for Illinois.
Because Woodruff wants to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino to the Faculty of Philosophy
"By ordering José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco y vive", because his photographs in white and black, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have attracted my attention to the simplicity and strength they transmit, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
A show that sends a lot of feelings.
Resino is able to capture magical moments."
Assault for Honda Supersellers
In November the Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model has already had great viability, this new monovolume has an even wider internal space.
At all, it adds a refined mechanism, which increases the comfort of driving and allows us to save fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz presents a very similar line to that of the previous model, changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new machinery.
However, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation's market entry.
Therefore, one first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other producers.
Although the Jazz model is less known in Europe and in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon for sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan almost a million units of Jazz have been sold since the launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow you to increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model in 2007, the estimates will be raised to around 100,000 cars for 2009, suggesting an increase in sales of 17% in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of Jazz since 2002, corresponding to 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
With regard to the new generation, the Spanish branch officials are expected to sell around 2,000 units of Jazz within one year.
The arrival of the new Jazz itself will allow Honda to reduce the price of sales in Spain to a good extent.
In fact, the company's managers plan to reach the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, i.e. 4,000 less than in 2007, with about 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain by 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company is expected to reach 2% in 2010.
To succeed, Honda trusts in the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a hybrid with five ports and a compact format - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company expects to sell about 200,000 units a year around the world.
For the markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of the sales of Insight will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The Insight commercial launch is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the company's presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five inches in more), its width is 1.69 meters (two inches in more) and its interest is 2.50 meters, with an increase of five inches.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 metres.
Along with increasing dimensions, the interior is also expanded.
This advantage comes from the introduction of a new platform, and from the introduction of the fuel tank into the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the luggage – equipped with double background – rooms with 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
It is noted that these are the engine version measures 1.4, and that Honda Jazz 1.2's luggage capacity is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as the rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern improving access to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions are actually opened with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with a petrol engine of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both mechanisms include i-VTEC technology that allows lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions, optimise the mechanism and maintains the engine's pair in all its phases.
The 1.2 litre model allows you to use a power of 90 cm to 6,000 wheels with a maximum pair of 114 nm to 4,900 wheels.
The proposal – which in previous Jazz reached 78 horses - uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous proposal, which in the model of the first generation used 83 horses, now they are available 100.
The Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses achieve a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
The "car board" to avoid collisions
In the context of the development of technologies for preventing accidents, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by the rivers.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, for example, takes the flight of the rivers, can prevent accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, the first step towards the technologies for the prevention of collisions.
The engineers at the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Centre developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and the Development of Brand Management, BR23C is an extension of the Nissan Security Survey of four areas.
This robot is designed to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicle of the manufacturer's home.
During the flight, each ape creates its own personal oval form space which is very similar to the safety shield of Nissan.
But the most important thing is the eyes of the rivers, able to see in all directions with a angle of more than 300 degrees, which enable the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
In order to regain this visual functionality, engineers have developed what they have defined as a laser location (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies the obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two metres and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance compared to the object and sends a signal to a on-board microprocessor which can immediately prevent collision.
"When a obstacle arises, the small robot imitates the movements of a needle and immediately changes direction by turning on the right angle wheels or larger to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape manoeuvre is completely instinctive.
"If it wasn't, the robot would not be able to respond with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and engineer the head of this project.
Unlike an apple, the robot cannot turn up or down, and even in diagonal; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which its wheels can rotate and do not use endless directions and methods like the apples.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
"This device only needs to develop the information every few seconds, and to act from these data.
It does not require storage of information or intuitive logic of previous manoeuvres, so it can work without interruptions and with only a couple of dozens of KB memory.
This may surprise us, but we are not talking about memory gigabytes, and not even mega."
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan hopes will be a series of cars within ten years.
The robot uses batteries for lithium polymers, which are lighter and more durable than the typeology with lithium ions.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to lead the destination driver away from the obstacles in the path.
Delay before asking for a loan
We must recognize that the Department of Treasures of the United States, apart from having many capitals to intervene, is certainly not free of engineering.
Faced with the crisis and in order to prevent Americans from engaged with mutual space in doubt-insolvency banks, they have created a fun and educational game for users of the network: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Hotel of Credited Boys"... or problems.
The theater aspect of this arrangement and, in particular, its receptionist serves to force you to think not one, but also two or three times before asking for a loan.
And above all, where to do it, which is probably the primary objective.
Of course the information the game provides is useful, but it does not appear in detail.
It is more a page for teenagers than a website for the public.
What happens when the game is complete?
Well, compare a sound room inside the hotel.
It's always something, because buying a better house doesn't even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the signing of an agreement with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a share equal to 21% of the company's participation, news came after a net decrease in its shares in Borsa.
A week after the conclusion of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that the MMFG would have bought 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shareholders at an individual cost of $25.25, a sum of three billion.
The fixed price is less than 19% at the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31,25, ensuring a 10% return.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall operation would be based on an average price of $29 per cent, i.e. a percentage lower than its current course of 28%.
However, by 1700 the title Morgan Stanley fell from 6.79% to 23.07 dollars.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding company," explained John Mack, director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow him to differentiate his actions, however, by making them pass under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis requires Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent approach to the matter in advance.
The arrangements defined Monday also show that in the last days the agreement has been amended: last Monday, Morgan simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese Colossians for a sum of $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of the MUFG, explained: "We thought our share of participation would have been exclusively composed of ordinary actions.
But considering the current state of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect them."
On the basis of the weighted average price, the MMFG will receive the title Morgan Stanley at a lower price than their accounting value of 7%.
And the operation would be translated into at least 20% of equity on a dilute basis."
The agreement provides that the MMFG will be able to convert one-half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in one year if, during a given period, they will be exchanged over 50% below the fixed conversion price, i.e. at about $47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by the MMFG would allow him to take investment opportunities, strengthen his budget and increase his liquidity.
A representative of the group, however, refused to provide clarifications on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a Tier One solvency coefficient of approximately 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan needed to "cleanly" ease his budget from the end of August.
In recent weeks, the group has been tested, which has seen the value of its actions diminish while the insurance cost against risks has suddenly been committed.
The cost of running on Monday, however, remains at a high level, around 12%.
The week passed the Goldman Sachs, the only other "surprises" between Wall Street's large investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's discovery, announced that he had won $15 billion, partly at the Berkshire Hataway, Warren Buffett Group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Founding the Republic on a socialism right in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was this last time to vote on the draft new constitution.
Mission since the official results, 64% of the voters have voted "yes" to the referendum, based on an 80% vote.
According to these results, "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% were white cards.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, half of the votes should be taken, more than one.
On Sunday, two investigations carried out at the end of the electoral march and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced a stunning victory of "yes", which was between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed in the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his constitutional project.
The "Constitution has glorified triofa", he assured, congratulated the Ecuadorians within the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers south-west of Quito.
As always, Chavez and Morales welcomed Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The survey, carried out in full peace under the electoral observation mission of the Organization of American States (OEA), was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution devotes the power of the state to the economy, subjecting it to the "development plan" of a country which is essentially living from the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently their currency.
The project, which was chosen by Korea in 2006, will also give greater power to the Head of State, which will be elected for two consecutive four-year mandates, which will have the opportunity to vote for the Assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to take advantage of this amendment and to renew its application for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also states the freedom of health and education services, which the President has begun to promote in this country 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population live below the poverty threshold.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
I 19 arrests released in Ciad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the rapists of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian fellow prisoners in the wilderness for ten days were brought to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon, healthy and healthy.
In the morning, they were released in Ciad by an Egyptian command.
Apparently, the obstacles were reached at the base of Almaza, near Cairo International Airport, to the 15th and 30th sides of a special airport.
On a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to send any interviews to the press, the Maadi hospital, a resident of Cairo, to be subject to analyses.
Goodness of "good health" and no record of "the sequestrationists" has been paid," said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the landing track.
On September 19, during a safari in 4x4 at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering with Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages was beaten by a cover to another of 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group was composed of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four autists, a border guard and the director of Egypt, the organizing agency of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night, shortly before the Alba.
"There have been shots , half of the kidnappers have been killed while the others have been fled," said the officer who requested to keep the anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the special forces of the "light" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commands.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of secret agents and Italian special forces.
We must admit that if we have achieved this result it has been thanks to the professionality and efficiency of the men of our secret services, special forces," he said, without adding more details.
He also forgot to pay a ransom.
On the first day, the Sudanese Pattula army claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on which the kidnappers were found and killed six, including the chadian leader of the rapists, and had two captured.
According to the army, the secessionists would be linked to an organization of Darfur's rebels, the movement for the liberation of the Sudan (SLA_U), a statement immediately forgotten by the latter.
Letter - The silent majority of culture
First, a debate on the financing of culture focused on the current electoral campaign.
That's better.
But part of our cultural life is always in the shadow.
Who will be present to report the total poverty granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that make the hungery?
What policy will be recalled to the federal government that is crossing heritage monuments and buildings?
What in Quebec, like Canada, do we have no facts and laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government has three and a half million euros for the only restoration of the castle of Chinon in the valley of Loira?
In our vicinity of the United States, it is the Constitution to state that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all of this by common agreement.
In Québec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Québec, there are at least 40,000 volunteers who, grouped in 211 companies for the protection of historical, genetic, archives and heritage conservation, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
They are themselves who, often, defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack with their bulldozers our forgotten remains and cemeteries.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize a part of Fortis Bank
Benelux's states help through partial nationalisation of the Belgian and Dutch Fortis bank, which is in difficulty first in Europe for the crisis in the American credit market: the three nations will provide EUR 11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interest in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the maximum level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Competition Commissioner.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been discussed for more than a year is that of Fortis, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard may constitute a precedent.
Under the decision taken on Sunday all night and three states will lose almost half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will sell almost definitely part of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week Fortis' actions had begun with a vertical round, and a series of crisis signals from the institute were then presented in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow them to fail.
The bank's actions on Friday are almost 12%, the lowest point of 14 years.
Since January the value of the actions has decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current stock prices, the total value of the group's capital is about EUR 14 billion, but the bank's managers consider that this value is not real.
The company's head led to the collapse of Fortis's actions to the uncertainty of the foreign market due to the acceptance of the US plan of 700 billion dollars.
Monday's title has slowly recovered.
On Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed a new bank delegate.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers, but no one has so far been presented with a suitable offer.
The Belgian government had already ensured that investors should not fear losing money.
The panic has not spread among the bank's customers, the branches have not been tested.
In Hungary the Fortis owns autonomous branches and has also acquired leases.
The voluptage in the pool
In America, health and life insurance companies often refuse to establish an insurance contract on the basis of the data on the purchase of medicinal products by persons.
Privacy experts fear that the data market becomes uncontrollable.
"There is a program of privacy according to which the use of prescription data depends on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it's like trusting the pulse to the volpe" - writes Washington Post by calling Richard Dick author of the program to follow the prescriptions of the medicines.
Insurance companies shall subsidize the insurance fee and the expected number in case of leftovers to the health status of the client concerned and if they are too high the risk does not provide for insurance.
Some time ago the customer had to undergo a medical visit and the contract was established only after the end of the examination.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much more economic procedure: based on the customer's identification code, it can easily have information from the medicines he bought in the last year and in the middle of the year and from this the program avoids what diseases are suffering and what health conditions are there.
A. e. if it regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that the level of fat in the blood is in practice unevenly high and is classified in the highest risk category.
There are several versions of the programme, some also determine the risk multiplier, so in addition to the paper job, there are few difficulties.
In contrast, some medicines are used for more purposes, e.g. some compounds are used against e.g. migraine or heat pumps, but they are also effective against depression.
This latter, from the point of view of insurance - commercial, is considered to be a risk increase factor, the first two nos.
For the request and processing of data companies have been formed and these, before receiving the necessary information from the pharmacist, require the patient’ s approval.
Now the authorities are obliged to do so even if they have not yet had much to do with neglect.
Some diets recently also prepare the results of laboratory tests and connect them to drug consumption data to provide a more accurate picture of the patient’s health status.
More and more teeth have access to data, and at the same time the control of use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on privacy but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a legislative proposal which gives the authorities the competence to control the data services specialised companies.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: that is why he has developed a programme that links the other data with the approval expressed by the interested party.
Another issue is that the person concerned may not so much refuse the approval because otherwise the insurers do not provide for the contract.
So at the end of the gallins are entrusted to the clemency of the vole.

European Union and India doubling trade
Since the European Union and India are partners who are particularly trading, the agenda of the ninth meeting was also dominated by this issue, as well as by all other global problems.
Today there will be a French-Indian summit that will take the first place in nuclear energy cooperation.
The European Union recognises that India is becoming a great democratic power which should be more prominent in international affairs, but the Member States are not yet able to decide whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So this issue was not emphasized at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they have reached the agreement to double in 5 years, i.e. to increase trade to up to EUR 100 billion.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods has risen from 25 to 55 billion, this is not a very ambitious trajectory.
As a result, 26 bilateral civil aviation agreements have been legally unified and air traffic can also take its course in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The objective is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth place among EU partners.
The summit focused on global developments.
In the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and in terrorism, this has been condemned in all its forms by both parties, and they have called for the convening of a UN conference.
They drew the conclusion of the Doha Round, although both parties played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that the energy and climate programme would continue, i.e. at least 20% by 2020, to reduce the emissions of harmful substances.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the need to establish a global agreement at the climate conference scheduled for the next year and to reduce the production of greenhouse gas by 50% by 2050.
They also wanted to slow down the increase in food prices and supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will now return to the French capital where at a bilateral meeting he prepares to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is expected that the French German nuclear reactors would receive an amount of EUR 20 billion in order to build them.
According to information from our printing agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
In Francoforte over three hundred Italian editors
Strong presence of Italian editors at the International Fair of the Book of Frankfurt.
Over three hundred Italian editors will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international appointment for the exchange of rights.
The International Fair of the Book of Frankfurt is expected for this edition over 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy 171,790 square metres of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles in the exhibition and with Turkey as guests of honour.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Beni and Cultural Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the opening ceremony of the Italian Padiglion: Italy will be present institutionally with an Italian Point - 264 square metres of exhibition space.
The meeting will follow with the press at Room Structure in the 5.0th floor of the Buchmesse: this will be an opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of the edition in Italy.
According to the data gradually decreases the weight of foreign authors' books on the total Italian production, in particular for adults and boys.
Found Steve Fosset's plane the billionaire disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane was discovered, the billionaire disappeared on 3 September 2007 while flying over the wilderness of Nevada.
The routes were returned to an altitude of 3000 metres, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
There were no human remains inside the vessel, however.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, escaped the doubts that remained: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fosset was flying the day he disappeared" said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found in the air or in the surrounding area.
The billionaire, 63, was given death in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) announced that some hours after the relic notice was sent to a team of investigators, who then identified the device: this is Bellanca 8kcab, released on 3 September 2007, when Fosset landed from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal effects were returned by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
It is two documents named Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash in cash and a wallet.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has won a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world round on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later he had turned the world around into aerospace and without a scale.
Among his many records, he also flew to 15445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a doppelganger.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect
A Suv out of the schemes with original design and well-defined by decided lines, wide surfaces and net angles.
This is, in fact, Glk's last born among the "compatits" offers of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a brand of novelty in this sector.
For its content outside the traditional cannons, it will be unexpected and non-conventional even the communication that will accompany the launch of the South Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showroom on October 17th.
So the advertising battage that will accompany the start of the new vehicle will also have an independable communication mode through an adventurous 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi-fictions, which will dominate the central route of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first stage of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the stereoscopic vision car and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso How to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image will have the impression that the car is out of sight.
Next, through the use of innovative technology Elumina8 the new glk will be enlightened at different times in all its details, and then restored in a single image.
Mercedes is no doubt trying to introduce something new in the stereotyped field of automobile communication.
Will this formula help to stimulate the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Here's who the Italian hooligans are.
From Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls whose entire Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following the National Azura for years and that now, for the truth, has never created excessive problems.
He's never been out with hostile typhoses.
The group's extraction is right.
The promoters come from Triveno.
From Verona, Padova, Trust and Udine.
To these in Sofia, groups (a few units, in fact) were added from Campania and Puglia.
There are three-coloured bands where they accompany the towns of origin of the soldiers: Saturday evening they were taken away so they could not be identified.
They're inspired by English typhoser.
In Bulgaria they found a true Nazi typhoser, the one from Levski.
Figc provided 144 tickets for the game: all nominatives, so easily controlled.
And the Viminale actually controlled them all: among those parties for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in the course, no one who had been prevented from attending a stadium.
Four blue-eyed typhoids, which had previously had stage reactions, were rejected in fact the ticket and prevented the transfer.
Now the Viminale looks forward to reading the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police and then taking measures: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to the boys who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the disorder.
An international daspo that prevents us from attending not only the Italian stages but also all of Europe.
Our hooligans, in fact, will no longer be standing in a stadium.
For luck.
But now there's fear-emulsion: that's what these little more than fifty, if they add others.
"We must immediately expose this fire and not legitimize who behaves like this," they support the Viminale.
So, "open your eyes very well, especially in view of the game of the National Wednesday in Lecce".
In Puglia there is a small nuclear power plant in the Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow you meet the Observatory, Tuesday the Casms can also count on a section of the Aise, i.e. secret services, which deals with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duke-Duce choirs and the fabric arm during Mameli's inn?
This is the thought (expressed in a really little happy way) of Domenico Mazelli, for a few weeks as director of the Viminale Observatory (it took place first of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferrizzi).
Mazzilli previously was this from Trieste where there is a nucleus of support from the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazelli says, that in Bulgaria it is not difficult to inject the Duke, but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 typhoids has been shameful.
"I don't make the sociologist - add Observer No.1 - the offences are attributed to the country in which they occur.
So far this group has remained in line, now we will see what has happened and we will appreciate the future.
But we're also talking about fish in the nest of Mameli: those too are not reborn, but if you allow me, they're not education ...."
