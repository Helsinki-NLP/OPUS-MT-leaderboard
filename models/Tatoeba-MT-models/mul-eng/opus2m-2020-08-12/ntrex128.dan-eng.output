Politicians in Wales are afraid of "like fools"
There was confusion among certain members of the National Assembly on a proposal to amend their title to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is due to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament (the Wallisian Parliament).
AMs from all over the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could give rise to late reporting.
A member of the Labour party said his group was worried because "it belongs to Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means the füllet, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Wallisian conservative said his group was "open" to the change of name, but noted that there is only a short verbal spring from MWP to Muppet (fly).
In this context, the Wallisian letter w is spoken in the same way that your letter is spoken in Yorkshire-English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drawing up a legislative proposal on the introduction of the names, said: "The final decision on names which Members of Parliament will receive is of course up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 empowered the National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, where there was a broad appeal to call the Parliament of the Council et walisian (Wells Parliament).
With regard to the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members (Valissian Members) or WMPs, but the MWP option was most reflected in a public consultation.
The AMs propose likely alternative options, but the struggle to reach agreement may be difficult for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to compile a legislative proposal on the amendments within a few weeks.
The legislative proposal for reform contains other amendments in the way the Assembly works, including rules on the discrepancy of AMs and the composition of the Committee's system.
The AMs shall have the final vote on what they shall be called when the legislative proposal is discussed.
Macedonians vote on the amendment of the name of the country
The voters vote on Sunday whether their country's name is to be changed to the "Northern Macedonian Republic".
The vote will be held in an attempt to resolve a ten-year struggle with neighboring Greece, which has its own province on behalf of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that their northern neighbour's name constitute a requirement in the territory of Greece and has long protested against Macedonia's attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov is opposed to the vote and says he will vote.
Members of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is only a price paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's are settled while the churches in Harlem fight
"The older men I've talked to said that in ancient times there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"No part today."
He said it's understandable that the bars are gone.
"People socialize in other ways now in days," he said.
"Just don't represent the daily routine of the neighborhood anymore, where people go on a daily basis."
In relation to the churches, he is concerned that the money that was meant to sell assets does not last long, and that "before or after they are back where they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes filled with people of the kind who do not help the rest of the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy properties in these buildings are white," he says, "and it adds to the development where these churches eventually close completely, because it is unlikely that most people who move into these properties will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had served nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken by a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who was in the throes of a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of Harlem's leading shopping malls who would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's son-in-law planned to restore the building, he ordered the clock game.
Priest David Johnson, the father of Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, called the watch game "the hour of the poor".
The expert who played the game in June called it "a cultural tax" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first watch game in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the largest watch game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't find a replacement for him.
What has taken place in St. Martin's last few months has been a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs. Some of them were captured by church leaders, others by the bishop.
In July, the Council of the Congregation, the Governing Body of the Council of the so-called Chief Doctors, wrote to the adjudication panel on concerns that the adjudication "will attempt to move the expenditure further" to the Council of the Congregation, although the Council of the Congregation had not been involved in the recruitment of the architects and contractors who the ad litemed.
Some of the members of the congregation complained about lack of transparency on the part of the panel.
Haj damages 13-year-olds on the carpet after hammocks in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he drowned after a fall in California on the first day of the summer season, says the officials.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 in the vicinity of Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had drowned with friends about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and then a group ran over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says that he thought it was just a pleasure to have caught a hombre, but then he realized that the boy cried out, "I was praying!
I was asked!"
"All his demands were renewed," said Hammel, he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried that everyone would come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was transferred to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was reported in critical condition.
I don't know what kind of shark there's going on.
The supplier Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark in the area had been seen a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage on his upper torso.
Ambassadors closed access to the beach on the route from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety purposes and to carry out investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 hazards in the area, but that most are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to enter the beauty market in Britain
Sainsbury's competition is up with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with ranges of beauty products with special assistants in large machines style.
As part of a major effort to enter the British beauty market, which has a value of 2.8 billion GBP and continues to grow, while fashion and housing products are falling. The larger range of beauty products are tested in 11 shops around the country and launched in several shops next year if they appear to be successful.
The investment in beauty products is based on the fact that the supermarkets are looking for new products to shelters previously used for television, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's says they double their selection of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, introduced for the first time.
The existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also allow more space with fired areas in style with them, you can see in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also relaxes the order of Boutique-makeup so that most products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required by younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume store Fragrance Shop is located in two Sainsbury's shops. The first opened in Croydon in the southern part of London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a development against buying small quantities of food daily in local buyers means that supermarkets must make more people visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of the Sanisburys, has said that shops are going to be like large machines, as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales sites in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales sites since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of daily goods and have made the purchases more profitable.
Previous Supermarket attempts to update beauty and apothecary divisions failed.
Sainsbury's experimented with Boots in the early 00's, but cooperation ended with a look at how the profits of the apothecaries in the supermarkets would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury sold their apothecary chain with 281 shops to Celesio, owned by the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional sortiation of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichi in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Saninsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the appearance and the device on our range of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in highly trained colleagues who will be available to give advice.
Our choice of fire is designed to meet all the needs and the incoming environment and the practical location means that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "resend" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement to 11 million GBP
Dragons' The star Peter Jones left "facing" after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to 11 million GBP with his life-style fire to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop fire.
This morning host, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she's leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' The-Star Peter Jones racing after she draws from their luxurious lifestyle in the last minute – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source says that Jones was "facing" since the popular TV woman during a busy Tuesday meeting in the main district of his business seminar in Marlow in Buckinghamshire said that her new agreements – with a value of up to 1.5 million GBP – meant that she no longer had enough time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop fire and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of 11 million GBP.
Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she left Truly while Jones flew out of the United Kingdom to one of her vacationers.
A source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would have been a long-term project that would have involved herself in the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday.
There is a warehouse full of goods in the main apartment in Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that this morning's report, which is among the most profitable stars of the United Kingdom, can cost the company several million because of large investments in products – all from powders to steel lighting for clothing and housing products – and the potential for further delays in the launch.
And it can also end in a long friendship.
Mother to three Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the Board of Directors in March.
The two couples take holiday together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall be a fireman for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin who was on TV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business approach."
Hard talk, "and then we were in love."
He laughed at the criticism he wanted from the media to make a comment that "is not a valuable president" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Trump said in his parody at a news store.
"I did nothing."
He noted that Kim was interested in a more meeting, after Trump announced their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear pollution in North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear pollution have been under way.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's High Diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the members of the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see a "compared reaction" from the United States compared to North Korea's initial measures against disarmament.
He noted that the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the press running.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view of the language at his election meeting.
"It's really going well with North Korea," he said.
"There was an appeal to war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve Kim's relationship had produced positive results – the completion of the rocket test, the release of hostages and the sending of Earth's remains from American military men.
And he defended his unusual procedure in relation to Kim.
"It is so easy to act stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this nearby arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," Trump said and pointed at the group just before him.
Indonesian tsunamis and earthquakes strike and kill several hundred
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need it.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lomboks were homeless, national disaster conditions were not declared, which is a prerequisite for international emergency aid.
"In many cases it has been very clear that they do not ask for international assistance so it is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While Save the Child brings together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign workers can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, speaker for the national disaster preparedness, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to contribute to emergency aid.
Because of the earthquakes that are being subjected to the constant siege of Indonesia, the country is very badly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami airports are built in Aceh, but they are not a common view on other coastal lines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but apparently there was no tsunami, and it probably affected the death rate.
Even under the best of circumstances, it is challenging to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship located in Lombok to deal with earthquakes is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia’s lack of infrastructure a central point in its election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and trains.
However, Mr. Jokos' administration has been affected by lack of funding during the electoral struggle next year.
Mr. Joko also experiences pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of confidence.
Over 1,000 people were killed and thousands of thousands were taken away from their homes when Christian and Muslim bands fought on the streets with machester, bow and arrow and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge comparisons at the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a fall in Premier League to Chelsea with a score in the 89th Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri small 30 metres from Chelsea's target, while his hold was behind with 1-0.
He pointed to the ball with left foot before he made a high shot at the top of the hill.
The ball flew high above the field above the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a hopeful Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting in the position to get caught in the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come, and I made a simple touch. I didn't think so much about it and just took the knife."
Chelsea led 1-0 by half, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea attacker delivered with the wheel back to Matthew Kovacic before he put the speed up on the middle road and printed it on Liverpool's side of the road.
Kovacic made a fast one-to-two on the middle road.
He then made a long delivery that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from defense and ended up against the remotest column with a shot with the left-hand head through Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool fights with Naples in the group game in the Champions League at 15 o'clock on Wednesday at St. Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.

Deaths from Tsunami in Indonesia increase to 832
The death rate from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832 informs the country's disaster preparedness early Sunday.
There were reports of many arrests in the walls of buildings that fell after the earthquake measuring 7.5 on the judge's scale. It struck up to 6 meters high waves, told the speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by walls from combined buildings.
Politicians arrest a man at 32 during suspicion of murder, after women are tortured to death
A murder investigation is under way after a woman's death was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 at Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested in suspicion of murder.
The police have called on people in the area who saw or heard something about moving forward.
Politician Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in early stages of research, but I will invite all those who have stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and then heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I would also like to encourage everyone, especially tax drivers, who may have taken something with dashcam to contact us, since they may have information that can be crucial to research."
A police speaker has confirmed that the woman, if found at all, is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon friends who think they know the woman came up to ask where she was found this morning.
The research continues, and the police say they are in the process of informing the victims of the victim.
A tax officer who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but he's got to know from the police that no one has to come into the building.
He was shot when he heard what had happened.
The citizens now know that there are hours before they can come in again.
A police officer was told to tell a man that the whole area is now considered a place of action.
A crying woman is coming.
She keeps repeating, "It's so scary."
At 14 o'clock there were two police cars in front of the station and another car right outside.
A number of staff were in the process of interruption and monitoring the apartment complex.

Parliament's status of Cromwell becomes the latest landmark, which is based on the debate on "recording history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatical, Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society described Mr. Cricks' proposal as "gallocab" and a "try to re-write history".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in connection with the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would be a goal.
The storm of images during the English civil war was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for his father Thomas' actions in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic image of Cromwell is a testimony to the positions of the 19th century and some of the history of a figure that many still believe is worth covering.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against out-of-court pressure in his case from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate picture is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is absolutely certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one identifiable figure that represents the one side of the struggle.
His performances as Lord Protector are also worth holding and remembering."
Killerbergris hits and kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a grey on a market in southern China according to local media reports.
The man who was only identified under his surname "Yuan", was found dead with an overcrowded pulse year and drowned in blood near a crackster on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post Sunday.
A grey farm is preparing to give grey injections with vaccines at a grey outbreak on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai province of China.
He apparently traveled with his relatives from the nearby province of Yunnan Wednesday to sell 15 greys on the market.
The next morning the father found him dead and discovered that a door to the Griston next door was open.
He said there was a big nose with blood in his mouth in the grass.
A legal medical investigation confirmed that the 250 kg crisis had caused the farmer to die, according to the report.
"My father's leg was bleeding and wet," said the father, who goes under the title "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Assumptions from security cameras showed that Yuan went into the market at 4.40 a.m. to feed his grass.
His bed was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his descendants.
A market leader told Evening News that the crisis had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while the police collected evidence at the scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
This is true of the rare ones, but there have been cases previously recorded where Greece has attacked people.
In 2016 a grey woman and her husband attacked their garden in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a gray one of 295 kg was a Walisian farmer against his tractor, into his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his grass in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News told him that grass is not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as a "trigger".
"They're just sick.
The cops, they're very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect," he said.
The rest of the Rosa Orcan is expected to give heavy rain in most of the South-West USA
As foretold, the Rosa Orcan becomes weaker, as it moves across the cooler water at the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will give a strong account of floods in North Mexico and South-West America over the next few days.
Rosa won 38 m/s, a category 1-Orkan, at 10 Sundays (Dansk time) and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low-pressure race across the Pacific Ocean, moving east toward the west coast of the United States. After Rosa approaches half the Baja California manag as a tropical storm, it begins to jump tropically up north into the South-West United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm rain in parts of Mexico manganese.
Then the tropical fusser will interact with the low-pressure trigger that will come closer and create a strong rain in the South-West USA in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm rain will create dangerous torrential rivers, flowing down and possibly soil in the forest.
The tropical cave will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rise to 51 to 101 mm rain in parts of the South-West USA, particularly in large parts of Arizona.
There is a high likelihood of storm floods with rapid deterioration due to the widespread nature of tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out in the forest of foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn waves into floating rivers and thunders will create powerful local winds and create dust floods.</seg>
The low-pressure runner approaching will give strong rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total deceleration of more than 13 mm, which may give less amounts of fluid drop and smooth path.
This would be the first downturn of the region during their rainy season.
Split tropical rain forests will be close to Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and will spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the area Four Corners Tuesday and continues Wednesday.
In October there can be a large temperature decline throughout the United States, since Arctic is cooler, but there is still a reasonable heat in the troops.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature difference across the central US Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
A large part of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a hot start on October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the south to the part of the north-east.</seg>
There can be up to 26 degrees in New York City Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate perspective indicates that there is a high probability of temperatures above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million so the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million of them were so gripping testimony from the nominated High Priest Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse that reportedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, at six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle continued with stations that broke the general programmes to tell about the recent development of the Friday: an agreement which was concluded by Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, which allowed the FBI to conduct a long week of investigation of the complainants.
Because the Senate's ruling committee told her that she was 100 per cent sure that Kavanaugh would be able to grab her and try to take her clothes off to a gymnasium.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional statement that he is 100% sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw it Friday.
The company considered average sales of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were not immediately available sightings from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of programs in offices.
In order to put it in perspective, it is a visual number corresponding to a fight under the NFL playoffs or Oscar division.
Fox News Channel, whose meanings are very strong, has looked up at the appointment of Kavanaugh, above all of the stations with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the whole day, Nielsen said.
ABC was on the second floor with 3.26 million euros.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate Republicans sent a statement that he wanted to vote for Kavanaugh, he was arrested for opening CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, while demonstrators called on him when he tried to take an elevator to the hearing of the trial committee.
He was looking down for several minutes while he was being robbed, and CNN sent life.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you trust him to tell the truth to the country?"
He got to know, "You have so much power and so many women are powerless."
Fleke said his office had sent a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television stations covered life a few hours later when the ruling committee would vote on whether the nomination of Kavanaugh would go on to a vote for the whole Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote under the conviction that the FBI would investigate the complainants against the nominated next week, which the Democrats, who are in the Senate, had asked.
Fleke was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators followed, Fleke took his decision.
The choice of the flag had an impact because it was clear that the Republicans would not vote to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation of the complainants against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accused critics of "legal policy" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU to "legal policy" with Britain's future and undermine national interests.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham in the United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May on the press front, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson presented her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal for the United Kingdom and the EU to collect tariffs was "all through late".
Shooting at Wayde Sims: The police arrest Dyteon Simpson who is suspected of being behind the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dytheon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of accidental murder, said the police in Baton Rouge.
Ambassador released videos of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on, reported the CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After Simpson's execution, the police told him he was allowed to shoot Wayde.
His bail is set to US$ 350,000, reports the lawyer.
The judge in East Baton Rouge Parish sent a preliminary report on Friday, where it was said that the cause of death was an injury from a gun wound from head to neck.
The police department says that a task force from Louisiana State Police, State Police Agency, Southern University police and citizens in the area have been assisted by research that led to detention.
The leader of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for their "umhu and quest for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said that the holder is "knushte" and "in shock" over the death of Waydes.
"That's the kind you're always afraid of," said Wade.
Vulcan spy shell over Mexico City
Aske, quoted from the volcano Popocatepetl, has reached the southern quarters of Mexico City.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, after which crater activity occurred, and 183 emissions of gas and gas were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre monitored the spaces and the crossings over several directions.
Social media images showed thin layer of ass on car squares in quarters in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres south of the capital, since a earthquake measuring 7.1 on the correctional scale struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The police meet with Catalan separatists before the jubilee for the vote on independence
Sex was arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, following demonstrations of independence, meeting with the Euro-Bederant in the presence of thousands of participants in rivaling demonstrations marking the first year of the Catholic polarisation vote on the resolution.
A group of masked separatists kept urubins back, cast with and powdering and created dark dust spots on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also casualties later on the day when the police used their character to hold the battles down.
Over several hours, independence groups called "Not forgotten, not forgiven" and were met with Union demonstrators who called "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests reported the local press.
The vote is still high in the independent region one year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid, but is celebrated by separatist Catholics.
The voters voted excessively for independence, but the voter's connection was low, and those who opposed the resolution voted in a large-scale vote.
According to the Catholic authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote during violent meetings at polls throughout the region.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration of the withdrawal of the national police.
The demonstration was held, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife said that he no longer hoped that Catalonia could achieve independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out with joy that they had the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Although they received a snow, but important, victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties have fought to maintain the moment, and many of their best known leaders are either moved into exile or sides in detention and wait for their role in maintaining the vote and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, picked up the protests on his phone to support the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There will be more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders who had waited for his case last year, announced that he would vote for the European Parliament next year.
"The opposition as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to distance ourselves from the backdrop of the democratic values and the perception we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested, after house framed by car
Three men in 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car several times entered a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent Thursday about 19.30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the doors and the building itself.
It may also have been fired from a wheelchair against the car at a time.
Scotch from Menga gives Livingston victory on 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Mengas first target for Livingston secured the victory
The Brilliant Livingston crossed Rangers and gave Steven Gerard his only second landing after 18 matches as manager for the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas' shot made the difference when Gary Holt's crew jumped up side by side with Hibernia on the other side.
Gerard's team has not won the league in this season and will meet the leading team Hearts, which they have eight points after, the next Sunday.
Before then Rangers will visit Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Livingston builds up their unsuspected strike for six battles, and Chief coach Holt has not yet received a discount since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livington misses chances for cash outlay
Holt's holding should have been long before they scored, and their direct game style created big problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson breaded through, but delivered across the front of the target, after which Alan Lithgow accidentally hit out of the target, after he was glad to frame Craig Halkett's cross-heads before the target.
The housekeeper was pleased to let Rangers play before them because they knew that they could get away with the problems of death.
And it was under the circumstances that the important goal came.
Rangers started free park, and Livingston used an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created together the Menga, which made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At that time Rangers had dominated the fighting, but fought to get through the defense of the home, and the mayor Liam Kelly was largely not challenged.
The pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos took a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was defended with the hands of Ranger's targetman Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame under another of Livington's deaths.
There were ongoing shipments into Livingston's field, but they were refused, and two requirements for punishment – after Halkett's thanks to the translator Glenn Middleton and one for hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Fennomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal effort and strong results for Livingston.
All played fantasticly and exceed the expectations of their previous journey.
Their game style and team is largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large part of the honor has to go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the hold since he joined.
There were lots of people.
The leader Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organised defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the servings throughout the fight.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've at times been really good under Gerard, but they played under level.
Their conclusions lacked sharpness – only once did they get their own home – and this is a great awakening for Rangers, which is located in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cool
There was a smelting and blue sky on Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations with the two NATO members.
Inconsistencies have arisen over areas such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's approach to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cool to open a new, big Moscow.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police held up for security reasons a population of 25,000 from meeting in front of Moscow, but a lot of support appeared in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also noted and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to oppose the country.
The competitive protests reflect a controversial guest, which is seen as one of some German Turks and the hand as an autocratic by others.
Unlucky on the way to Deptford: Cyclists die in conjunction with car
A cyclist is dead in a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a road in Deptford in the southwestern part of the city about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were rescuers on the spot, but the man died on the ground.
The accident occurs several months after another cycler died in a car meeting, which leads refugees from the area, on the Children's Street, about 1.6 km from the accident of the day.
The Metropolitan Police said the police officer was working on identifying the man and informing him of his whereabouts.
Road crossings, bus routes are being refurbished, and motorists are encouraged to stay out of the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Sex officer injured under uro
Six prison officers have been injured during uro in a high-security prison according to Prison Office.
There were hours in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire about 9.30 BST Sunday, and the invalidity is still on.
Specialized "Tornado" officer has been arrested to handle the equipment involving eight prisoners and is held in one flight from prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A spokesman for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff have been tried to deal with the ongoing irregularities in the HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the officials are being notified to the police and can end up spending longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 employees, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison inspector was treated at the hospital after an arrest.
And in October last year, U.S. officer was sent to prison to deal with serious irregularities where employees were attacked by carjackers.
The Rosa Orcan threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm flood ( dry areas can bring benefits)
It is rare that a tropical low-pressure framework in Arizona, but it is most likely at the beginning of next week when the rest of the Rosa Orcan move over the rural landscape in the South-West United States and creates a risk of storms.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings about floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that "the tropical cyclones had only preserved status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an Orc within 64 km from the border to Arizona."
The latest models from the National Hurrine Center presuppose 51 to 102 mm rain with isolated quantities up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west countryside, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, will likely be 25 to 51 mm with a capacity of 102 mm locally.
For those without risk of storms, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Overcrowding is a very serious case, but it is likely that some of the rain will benefit because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.</seg>
According to U.S. drought monitoring, just over 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the nearest category," reports weather.com.
Firstly, Orcano Rosa is expected to frame countries on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.</seg>
Rosa still has solar power tomorrow with maximum wind power of 38 m/s and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north with 19 km/h.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore falls in strength.
It is therefore expected to meet in Mexico with tropical powered Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain on parts of Mexico can become strong and can pose a great risk for overcrowding.
"A total of 76 to 152 mm is expected from Baja California to the northwestern Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, before the border to Arizona early on the morning of Tuesday as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into the southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the rest of it is very heavy rain in Baja California, the north-west Sonora and the south-west U.S. forest area," National Hurrine Center reported.
The rain is expected to create life-sustaining torrents and floating falls in forests and earthquakes in mountain terrain.
Attacks in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were detained under suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton about 4 BST Saturday.
He was brought to the hospital where his condition was reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was arrested during the night in the Radstock area, says the police in Avon and Somerset.
Officers have invited all those who had to have mobile recordings of their actions to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was under the "vulnerability and anger" of the democratic party.
"A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the indifference and unfair tactics of the democratic party," said Trump at a election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had been exposed to "rejection, anger" from the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a witness before the convention on Thursday and strongly complained and felt guilty by Christine Blasey Ford that he had been sexually abused for several decades since they were teenagers.
Because he also gave a witness at the hearing of his complaints.
The President said on Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote on confirmation of judges Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of the most powerful legal brains in our time, a jurist with a fantastic past in public service," he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh, while he spoke of the importance of the meeting of Republicans at the polls at the midway elections.
"Five weeks are one of the most important choices in our life.
You can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me," he said.
"That's why I'm going around and fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are out on a mission to "fight against and block".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place at the latest Friday, a person in the Republican party has told CNN.
Several hundred killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis, the death toll growing
At least 384 were killed, and many of them were thrown out of battle waves that hit the beach, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, declared authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu on Friday, when up to six metres high waves hit the coast at the time of the quake, many drowned in death and destroyed everything on their way.
Tsunami was born after a earthquake measuring 7.5 on the correctional scale.
"When the tsunami broke out yesterday, people were still on the beach. They didn't run with the same thing and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster preparedness BNPB, during a lettering in Jakarta.
"Tsunami didn't come alone, the abandoned car, trees, houses, it hit everything on the ground," said Nugroho and added that it had moved through the open sea with 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
To survive by climbing into trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The disaster preparation has published aerial photographs showing many damaged buildings and shops, crowded and co-ordinated brothers and a mosque surrounded by water.
After-examinations continued to stir the coastal town on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes could be observed in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Board (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released during the great earthquake on Friday was about 200 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb dropped over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, small hole, and it may have made the tsunami larger, said the board.
Nugroho described the damage as "wide" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were managed together.
The likes of a number of victims were found fixed under walls from combined buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been damaged and 29 reported missing.
Nugroho said that the death rate and damage could be larger along the 300 km long coast line north of Palu, the area of Doghía, located closer to the epicenters of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely legged without information" from Donghara, Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 here," said Red Cors in a statement and added that their employees and volunteers are on their way towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," they said.
On Saturday the government was criticised from many fronts not to inform us that a tsunami had struck Palu, but the officials said that the waves had arrived within the time when the warning was sent.
A man on the top floor of a building can be heard in amateur receptions, which desperately sound warnings about the tsunami coming closer to people on the road below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water falls on the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the recordings with the same.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great wave of power to block communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun to send cargo flights with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reports authorities, but there is still a strong need for food and basic supplies among the evacuated.
The city's airport has been reopened, but only for aid work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit the evacuation centre in Palu Sunday.
The death rate after Indonesian Tsunami smokes more than 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision staff from Dothraa have certainly come to Palu city, where employees are looking for lights during presentations held in the garden at their account. They came across areas with extensive destruction on the road, Doseba said.
"They told me they were so many destroyed houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when aid organisations began the work of putting the aid back in place, there were complaints that foreign emergency workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, economic aid, supplies and staff from abroad must only come into the area where the accident has occurred, where the accident has occurred, to be declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, a member of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says "OK, it's a national disaster," we can open up for international assistance, but there's no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family were stuck to the missing people in hopes that their nearest would become the miracles that listen to the deep stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled up by a clock.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been arrested during the massacres for two days with her mother’s corpse next to her.
Gendon Subbandono, trainer of the Indonesian paragliding country, had trained two of the missing paraglids to Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandigi, were among his students.
"As the veteran in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us how he, after the news of the composition of the Roa Roa Hotel circled in parallel, had suddenly sent whatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were at the beach festival.
However, his messages resulted only in one grey river instead of two blues.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he says.
Two takes 26.750 USD while filling in Newport on the Level
Four stole Friday morning 26.750 USD from a Brink's employee who was carrying out a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The car driver had cleared the cash machine in the maintenance system and prepared to deliver more money, wrote the press release, and wrote a letter by the criminal officer Dennis McCarthy.
While he was arrested, another man ran "on the back of Brink's staff" and stole a tape that would have been delivered.
According to the press release, there were so many suspects who fled the scene, but the police did not indicate how many were involved.
All with information on the identity of the tribes are requested to contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes its name to Ye.
He announced the changed Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: "The beast was previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had named Ye for a time and used the name as title on its eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place before his performance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
He replaces the song of Ariana Grande on show, which was fired by "sensitive reasons," said the creator of the show.
The name is abbreviation of his current artist's name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most frequently used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier the year when he discussed his album title with the Big Boy radio.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who've changed his name.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former partners, JAY-Z, has also changed between small and large letters and changed whether the binding line is included.
Mexico AMLO does not commit to use military power against civilians
The newly elected President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has never promised to use military power against civilians as the country nears its 50th anniversary of a bloody act against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to impress the Mexican people."
Tropper shot at a peaceful demonstration at the site on 2 October 1968 and killed 300 at a time when left-oriented student movements hit many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly state grants to students and opening several free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double its financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they use in research in the field, says investors and AI users Kai-Fu Lee, who have worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come from various parts of the U.S. government, which has given statements of artificial intelligence. However, the United States still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to take the first place in innovation within artificial intelligence by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind in relation to the United States, and we are looking for the next major infringement within the AI," said Lee.
Repeating the budget could double the chances that the next major performance within artificial intelligence will be achieved in the United States, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is the Managing Director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent companies in artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the most ranked American Othello players, and later he became leader of Microsoft Research and director of Google's department in China.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions supported by the US government, such as Robotics Challenge, held by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition was to come so that the next visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States must often work hard to get leagues from the government, says Lee.
"It's not China that pushes the academic leaders, it's the big companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed astronomers from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhDs within artificial intelligence should have offered work permits automatically.
The State Council of China issued their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions in a way that corresponds to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations’ allocation of money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Ministry established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence to involve industrial and research partners and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of US$ 2 billion in an initiative named AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over US$100 million per year in research in artificial intelligence.
However, American legislation trying to create a national safety committee for artificial intelligence has been suspended for several months.
Macedonians vote on the amendment of the name of the country
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted on whether their country's name should be changed to "Northern Macedonia" a measure that would resolve a decade-old conflict with Greece which has blocked Macedonia's attempt to achieve membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province on behalf of Macedonia and maintains that the name of their neighbouring countries to the north constitutes a requirement in the Greek territory and has therefore used their vector when Macedonia has sought NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the amendment would undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian people.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the vote, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the amount of the vote will represent the 50% required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the motion for a resolution was: "Do you agree with the agreement with Greece for NATO and EU membership?"
Subjects of the amendment, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price to be paid to create connections such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that have emerged as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so they can live free under the EU's umbrella, because it means more secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the vote and do so.
The name change would require a majority in Parliament on two thirds.
The State Election Commission said that at 13 o'clock there were no reports of irregularities.
However, the vote was only 16 per cent compared with 34 per cent at the last parliamentary election in 2016, where 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We are at home in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an elector in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the Macedonian vote on a change in the name of the country, which would open up for NATO and EU membership in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and pulled a chair in front of the hall which was set up by those who wanted to vote.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we will achieve membership with a strong pace, not to the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would provide a strong investment in Macedonia which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I think a large majority will vote for because over 80 percent of our citizens are going into the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a "yes" result would be "ensure our future."
An opinion issued last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43% of the voters would participate in the vote – less than the required electoral participation.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57% of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Out of these 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the vote shall be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the pilot government since it joined in May last year.
See: Manchester City Sergio Aguero is fighting through the whole Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton Defense in Manchester City 2-0th-ever Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero was able to look slightly lightly out with his score, which came after 65 minutes.
The Argentinian attack received a delivery on the midway at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenses before he moved out on the open road.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green suits.
He fought over one champion, and then walked from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
Then he made a delivery to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used its first touch in the field to return the ball to Aguero, who used its right to list Brighton target Matthew Ryan with a shot at the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet," said the City Manager Pep Guardiola reports.
"We talked about he'd play about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal right now."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate launch in the Premier League.
That goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received in the series deep deep into Brighton's territory.
He sent a great delivery along the left side to Leroy Sane.
True took a couple of hits before he led Sterling against the remotest column.
Sky Blues forward marked the ball in the net just before the joy over target.
City is fighting Hopeneheim in the team game in the Champions League at 12.55 Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim in Germany.
The mouse will push Rockies
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to enter the castle Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still opportunity for participation in playoffs for Rockies, who have played a fight more than Los Angeles Doggers in NL West.
The Rockies held at least in a wild card place with a 5-2 victory over National's Friday night, but still has their first division title for good.
"Even if we don't have anything to play for, we can go to the fight well knowing that the atmosphere would be on its highest level among the public here in Denver and that the opposition would play on the highest level I'm going to stand up for this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play under those circumstances?"
Nationals have not yet reported the start date to Sunday, but likely Scherzer will be involved in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the platform for the 34th time, trained his cast Tuesday and would point on Sunday, which is usually his holiday.
The right hand player from Washington is on 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 in this season.
Trump holds a election meeting in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation about his election to the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he spoke of the importance of the meeting of the Republicans at the polls.
"All we've done is in play in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our life.
It's one of the big, big – you can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me. That's why I'm going around and fighting for fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this awful, horrible radical group of democracies, you can see, it's happening right now.
And they're firmly determined to get power back with all the resources available.
They're equal to who they hurt, who they have to run to get power and control; that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give them that."
Democrats, he said, have a mission "strate against and blockers".
"And you've seen it over the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "wrecky and vicious and malicious and false."
He referred to the top democratic senator of the Senate's ruling committee named Diane Feinstein, which released a loud public vote.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you copy the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, wait right – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
The lab is no longer a romantic party.
They are intolerant of those who express their views
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am only the last of a number of Members of Parliament from the Labour Group who have come to know that we are not welcome – only because we have given our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she took a strong stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship went out to criticize me because I was inconsistencies with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, Ironic enough similar problems, which Jeremy had inconsistencies with previous leaders.
In the invitation to the Nottingham East Labor meeting on Friday, there was that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a local member of Parliament, the meetings last Friday night were exactly like this.
Today, the tone at many meetings is unfortunately not like this, and the law on "more, more obvious" policy is far behind in the past, if it ever comes into force.
It has become more and more clear that divergent views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are taken into account if the party's management can accept them.
Shortly after that, Jeremy was the leader when colleagues whom I had previously thought to share political position began to expect that I would make an U-turn and adopt positions which I would never have agreed on – whether it was national security or the EU's internal market.
When I say my opinion in public – and this is really very much what I say – it follows a long series of grave news on the social media that calls for the rejection and opposition of the policy of the Middle East and tells me that I should not be a member of Labor.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am happier than some of my fellow Members because the comments that are addressed to me are usually political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the fight among my fellow Members, who are overwhelmed every day by sexism or racism, but who still continues to fight.
One of the most exciting aspects of this political era is where normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labor would create a tolerant culture.
In fact, however, there is no longer a spacious organisation and with each miscellaneous vote or change of election rules, the party becomes smaller.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years that if I lay down on myself and I'm not so high-strengthened, I'll have to "I'll be fine".
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I became a member of Labor 32 years ago when I went to school, I was provoked by the loss of that government that had left our class in a state of emergency, and I set myself up to create better public services for those who need it most — whether it has been a member of the government or a minister.
I have never hidden my policy, nor in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could in some way have been confused about my political positions and differences with the current leadership.
To those who submitted the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country comes against Brexit, which will damage households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Head of Labor.
But this one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local voters whether they are members of Labor or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no form of threats of deviation or political suitability will keep me from acting out of what I think is your interest.
Chris Leslie is a member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Age 38 - 17 Melrose: Unsecured Air Becomes Tophold
Two later scorings may have had the final result of drawing a not entirely verifiable picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this fantastic entertainment match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only unhindered container of ten.
Finally, it was as high as their relative defence as their better use of chance, which took home home, and trained Peter Murchie was absolutely right to be satisfied.
"Our fight has been demanding so far, and we are still innocent, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "In respect of Ayr, they used their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful score from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr forward, but a gold card to the Scottish national player Rory Hughes, who was assigned to the battle of Warriors, gave Melrose a benefit, and Jason Baggot made a score that was not followed by a score.
Climo built Ayr's performance with a punishment park just before midnight. He scored and then got a solo score, so there was 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's score, which was followed by a park from Baggot, reduced the point difference to five.
Then there was a long break because Ruarhyh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was kicked out of the road on the bar. When the game was resumed, Air jumped off with a scoring from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up from Climo.
Operating Air Operator Blair Macpherson then received a gold card, and Melrose again used their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without subsequent parking after a period of intense pressure.
However, the housekeeper came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a gold card to thank Climo without the ball, MacPherson could follow a line-out score behind the incoming Air Kling.
Climo followed up with a park inside the columns and followed up with a more almost after, the game was resumed after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent flight players Gregor Henry down to the fifth score of the highway.
Set game stars to look after new careers in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to take the step towards the restaurant after it became apparent that he has taken the lead post for an authorised restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main person with his partner Greg Hemphil.
The Duoen has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and it means Kiernan planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the Director of Apion Morn Limited.
The chess player refused to comment on the story, but a source indicated to Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The Sea Is Ours": The State of Bolivia hopes that the Court will reopen its route to the Pacific Sea
The seamen patrol about the main quarters of the fleet, which are engulfed in the empires, in La Paz.
There's a blue flag on public buildings.
The river base from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River is oversized with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
In all the country of Bolivia, it is remembered of a coastal route that was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century, still strong, and the same is the length after sailing on the Pacific.
The expectations may be at their highest for several decades, while Bolivia awaits a judgment from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years' vote.
"Bolivia has moments, a sense of community and clarity, and of course she looks forward to the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screen throughout the country and hope that the Haag Court will provide Bolivia with its content that Chile, following several decades of discussions, is obliged to negotiate the sovereignty of Bolivia over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of Bolivia, who stands for a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot to do with the trial of Monday.
"We're close to turning back to the Pacific," he promised last August.
But analysts believe it is unlikely that the Court will take Bolivia's party – and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The United Nations Assembly, which is sitting in the Netherlands, has no power to extend the Chilean territory and has provided that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert at international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have given way back.
"The matter of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' military rhetoric has done it with the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at one time continue their discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in Haag, rejected the idea that the court's decision was abnormal.
Today Bolivia will have "a special opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "complete an era of 139 years with differences and benefit for both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime problem as a political crisis.
"Bolivia will never grant access to the Pacific," he added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see that we have conquered the past."
North Korea says there's no nuclear equipment unless they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never defeat their nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to comply with the commitments made during a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments were extended to the fact that American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to be facing a relaunch of the established nuclear diplomacy over three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a "willing dream" to continue sanctions and the resistance of the United States to a declaration ending the Korean War will sometimes bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is in favour of the declaration, so long as Pyongyang has not taken significant steps towards decommissioning.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump will have a more summit.
However, there is widespread suspicion as to whether Pyongyang is serious in terms of obtaining an arsenal that the country is most likely to see as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Modeshows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large main clothes that you will soon be able to buy in local shops
If you want to enlarge your hate collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne promised on the catwalk that a collection of outstanding major clothing in extra large size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection was impressed by Paris Fashion Week.
Very improbable had dominated Instagram in summer, and the two designers have sent their faceless creatures down to the catwalken.
The most impressive work from Valentino was an overcrowded with a quadrilateral cloud covering the heads of the models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including watermelons with jewellery and even ananas – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Browne also discovered a selection of strange masks – just in time to Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had combined leaves that remembered more about Hannibal Lecter than haute Couture.
One creature looked like thick grass with snorkel and masks, and the other looked like a salted waffles.
And if you're continuing the big fashions, you're lucky.
Sculptors predict that the huge ones could have come to shops near you.
The battlefronts arrive in the halls of "La Bomba", the street with a 60-centimeter wide shadow, which is set on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural brand behind the most unprofessional hate that was spread over the social media has sent a new great creation down to catwalken – a beach bag in the street that is almost as large as the model that shows it.
The orange bast case with bush fruit and a white leather handle was the most obvious in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylelist Luke Armitage said to the FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in general shops next summer. The designer has so much influence that it is hard to ignore the demand for accessories in combat."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have many excellent academic results behind them, and in 2018 there are still a number of unique exam results, which are strengthened by individual and collective success in the area of sport, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With an up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are running after providing the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As a education sector that can combine and implement a cross-country pension, we experience that modern languages remain a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it's the head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it's the heart."
It is an important reminder that we cannot just keep ourselves in English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can see from the latest exams this year that language is the highest in statistics with most of the exams in independent schools.
In all 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received high-quality A.
The data collected by SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72% of students had the character A in mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish also had an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign language as important competences, which will be needed in the future for children and young people.
Language is now considered the subject choice at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' thoughts and other places.
A study carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that among the reasons why employers were unable to hold free positions, 17% had lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills become more and more important than preparing young people for their future careers.
More jobs will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what careers young people choose, they, if they have learned another language, have a great benefit in the future with a lifelong skills like this.
The opportunity to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a break for competitors.
According to a YouTube survey of over 4,000 respondents in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
It is therefore important to invest in language education for those who are children today.
When you can speak more languages, especially languages from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland there are differences between schools in which language is taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others teach in languages that are expected to be the most important for Britain when it comes to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose between independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills required to succeed regardless of what the future offers.
At present, it cannot be denied that language continues to be really important for the country's future in a global business environment, and it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this distinction to Scotland's youth.
You have to do it.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets a start for Laker's Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who will see LeBron James play his first fight for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton has announced that James is playing in the opening of the Sunday before the start of the season against Denver Nuggetts in San Diego.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he's playing.
"It becomes more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reports Mike Trudell doubted that James would probably not play the whole game.
After the training last week, James was asked about his plans in relation to Lakers' planned six matches before the season start.
"Where I am in my career I don't have to fight before the start of the season to be ready," he said.
Trips election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of election meetings tonight in Wheeling in West Virginia.
It is the first of five scheduled election meetings in the following week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of the judges appointed by Trump to the seat at the High Court has been put in wait, Trump is trying to reverse the coming midway elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are passed in November.
When is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia is held at midnight (dansk time) between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can see Trump's election in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about this week's hearings about Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the High Court. The hearings were held because of complaints of sexual harassment, and the expected vote in the Senate on confirmation has been postponed for a week while the FBI is investigating the complainants.
But the main objective of this series of elections is to create a moment for the Republicans facing a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign said that the next week's five election meetings are aimed at "creating energy among volunteers and supporting when the Republicans are trying to protect and build the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", says Reuters.
"The control of the Congress is so important for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible, now that we are entering the busy campaign," said a speaker for the Trump campaign, which would not be mentioned by name, to Reuters.
The evening's election is held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump-attacks from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month, Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind measles.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to climb up to give him a boost in his mind measurements," said Simon Haeder, who works with state science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown hospitality and tries to keep the hope alive in front of Sunday's single doodles
After three one-sided shifts, the sound day's fireman doodles may have been the one this Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating momentum gap is a whole through the undiscovered sport concept, but a concept which players believe – not at least in competition like this.
Where would they say there's a moment now?
"They led with six points, and now it's four, so we can see it a little bit like a moment," said Jordan Spieth, before he held the four nights.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, they are 4 points ahead, and there are 12 points more to play about.
As Spieth says, however, the Americans feel that they have little wind in their sails, and there are lots of encouraging things to focus on, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and can both talk with three points of four possibilities.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and sets a good example for his roommates.
The high jubilant drums became higher, as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important bridge, which ensured victory in due four, although he and Thomas had been two shots behind two holes.
His poop, which assured them the fight on the 15th floor, was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows that he doesn't think that the American holding is out of competition yet.
"You just have to find the inner strength ahead and focus on your own fight," said Spieth.
That's all the players are back now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, no doubt the greatest story from Ryder Cup.
Europe's remarkable but sympathical couple have received four points in four wars, and there are errors.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine Friday mornings.
The series and the way that energy appears to fly both to and from the wild public shows that it is them that will be the hardest to hit Sunday. And it would certainly be very popular if a potential European winner is determined by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Allerhel's synchronous on each of their knees.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short trial against Sergio Garcia, tomorrow in the fire department, when he formed a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Svensker down in a hole, they were never near to get out.
Sunday there's no one who can help you out of your hole.
The games with four balls and two hold a two players are so fascinating to look at in close quarters because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change rapidly.
Europe has played better than ever and has created a significant performance before the last day, but the fireman dealers have also shown that the U.S. team has the best fighter, as some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe creates 10-6 before the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at Ryder Cup, after they came out of the four-day roundballs and foursomes with a show over the United States on 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a tough Tiger Woods and has so far received four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Björn's European team, trying to win the poker they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a straight American team in the morning's Fourball and won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. had more resistance in foursomes, they won four battles, but they were still behind.
Jim Furyk's holding shall use eight points of the Sunday's 12 single steps if they are to keep the pocal.
Fleetwood is the first European debater who has won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have received the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensual weekend, it's just another couple in Ryder Cups history who have won four points in their first four matches.
They beat Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then beat an elegantly loose Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought through the first two battle days, had little genius, but now he's lost 19 out of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in drawings.
Justin Rose was chosen for the four-ball tomorrow and returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and received a 2-1-winer over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – number three in the world.
However, Europe has as much as they would like to have, on a light, sunny day in the southwestern part of Paris.
Three-fold Major Winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans with two points Saturday.
They got a hard 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later turned back and beat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4-3 in foursomes after losing the first two balls.
It has only happened twice in the Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being back with four points before the single champions. Since Furyks currently has the poker, however, they only have to get paid to keep it.
However, after having worked for two days, it seems that they cannot master a mammoth Sunday.
North Korea says they won't fall unilaterally if there's no confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the UN Saturday that continued sanctions would strengthen their membership in the United States and that the country would not release their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the World Overseas Organization that North Korea had shown "significant goodwill" in recent years, for example by stopping nuclear and missynthesis, deplores an area of nuclear testing and does not promise to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We haven't seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will take the first step and fall unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-shared" access to nuclear equipment, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took steps. But his speech seemed important because it did not alone reject unilateral disarmament, which had previously been the case from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a Vice-President of the United States and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work "Atom equipment on the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has requested a formal end to the Korean War, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first hand over their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance in relation to the killing of international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on 'Atomnage first' and builds up the press with sanctions to achieve their objectives by force and even opposes 'the declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The view that sanctions can put us in trouble is a dream among people who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions strengthen our miscellaneous membership."
Ri did not mention plans for a more summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. leader stated earlier this week at the UN.
The Minister said three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in within the last five months and added: "If the nuclear equipment were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so closed."
However, the tone in Russia was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the withdrawal of North Korea rockets against the US country was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocked man" on suicide mission.
In the last year, Trump in the United Nations threatened with "total execution" of North Korea, but this year he rose Kim to stand up to defeat, but said that there was still much to be done and that the sanctions had to be maintained until North Korea collapsed.
Today Trump said he had no time plan for these measures, but he said, "It's very much if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council must maintain sanctions with conviction and without error until we reach the total, final, confirmed nuclear equipment."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased its economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline during the UN General Assembly and then said he wanted to visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip wasn't going well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that there had been progress, while North Korea had only a few hours after accusing him of putting in place "gangatory demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month North Korea promised to close a missile plant and an atomic complex if the United States took "the same step."
He said Kim had told him that the "comparative steps" he demanded were the security vows that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements against normalization of the relationship to Washington.
Students at Harvard take the course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all Bachelor students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to modernise the growing macho culture, where you study all night and keep up with large amounts of caffeine.
A researcher has shown that students at the world’s best universities often fail to take care of themselves first.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was given the idea of the course after holding a statement on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"When the show was finished, a girl came up to me and said, "Why do I get to know this right now when I'm on the candidate?"
"She said that no one had ever told her the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains how good bedrooms can improve their academic and sports performance and their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director of Health at the University, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in serious sleeplessness during the week.
The timed course consists, inter alia, of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises there is a picture of a college room where students should click on coffee cups, gardens, lunches and books to learn about the effects of coffee and light, how even sports performance is affected by sleeplessness, and how important good sleeping habits are.
In another part of the course, participants learn how sleeplessness over time increases the risk of heart attack, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of campus.
"We are well aware that it will not change the students' behaviour with the same thing.
But we think they have the right to know it - as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride that is taking a "allnight" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on the students have led to a growing problem of sleeplessness.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and sufficient sleep, he said – it even affects weight gain because sleeplessness makes the brain believe that you are hungry, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler last year to organize the course when he took one of his courses on his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and gave him work to make it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that the next one will be that all diminutors will be offered a similar course before they continue their training.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set up an alarm so that they know when to sleep and when to get up. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of light from electronic screens, which can smoke at daybreak and make it more difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Target from Menga cuts Gerrard and co.
Ranger's lead was another fall on the streets when Dolly Mengas' goal meant that Steven Gerrard's team had to take a fall at 1-0 in Livingstone.
The hold from Ibrox was out after their first victory on the streets since the 4-1th triumph of St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's holding gave Gerrard only another landing in 18 matches that train. There are eight points up to Hearts at the first place of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Several hits for seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangerhold could not respond to.
Rangers are now running down on a sixth place, while Livingston claims up on a third place after Hibernia with only the target score to different.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers when line judges Callum Spence had to be dealt with after being hit in the head of a cast object that seemed to come from the outside section.
Gerard made eight changes in the formation that reached Betfed Cups semi-finale by tonesing through Ayr.
On the contrary, the same 11 who were preparing a point of Hearts' performance last week, and he would have been afraid to see his sharp hold up the resistance across the road.
Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes in the fight when Mengas' first delivery sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle-way player's attempt to pass.
A free park at the bottom of Keaghan Jacobs found a way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow jumped through the backmost column.
Rangers took control, but played more on hope than on the ability of the attack game.
In any case, Alfredo Morales was not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson informed the Colombian appeals about the punishment park, when he and Steven Lawless were brought together after a quarterer's game.
Rangers managed only two shots at targets in the first half, but former Ranger targetman Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head seat and Ovie Ejaria's take-off.
Although the opening of Livis in the 34th minute was an accident, it must be said that it is worth their effort alone.
None of Rangers could handle a dead body situation in the depth of Jacob's.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took time to find Menga that could easily kick it in.
In the break Gerrard Coulibaly exchanged with Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave power when the flight player sent the ball into Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the audience to play on their prizes with many long balls up the track from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have extended the performance of the final part of the fight, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with his right hand before Lithgow got angry at the end of the fight.
Ranger's replacements Glenn Middleton appealed again for a late punishment park after being trained with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked here the other way.
Aarbook: Founder of Gegiertteller
And now a page from the annual book "Sunday Tomorrow": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we TELLER... – was the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger found a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a detection that would in time lead to the device known as the gegiert.
The geigert has become a solid component of both science and popular culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had the main roles as Buddhist scientists:
Man, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geigerator used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you use these main phones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms, which the radioactivity of the minerals makes."
Evans said, "Come on! There's going on!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he wanted to fill 63.
But the invention that bears his name continues.
The new cancer vaccine can teach immune defense to "see" cancer cells
The new vaccine can teach immune defense to "see" cancer cells and kill them.
Vaccine teaches the immune defense to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient and change them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many forms of cancer and where they are reinjected.
A test vaccine is promising in patients with a number of forms of cancer.
When a woman with marital cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches immune defense to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and changing them into the laboratory so they can "see" the protein by name HER2, which has many forms of cancer, and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "makes different forms of cancer to develop", including breast, ovarian, lung and breast cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach when immunization is taken out of patients and "learning" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West kept Trump-friendly speech introduced a MAGA-hat after his SNL performance.
It didn't work out.
After a remarkable event in the Saturday Night Live study, Kanye West was disappointed when he rejected US President Donald Trump and said he himself wanted to vote as president in 2020.
When he had played the third song of Ghost Town last night, he introduced a Make America Great Again Cascade, started on a surprise against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
"I'm talking so much to white people who say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's racist?'
But if I was worried about racism, I'd have been moved from the United States for too long," he said.
SNL started tonight's show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's witness in the Senate's trial about Christine Blasey Ford's arrest charges.
Even though the records were not shown, Commissioner Chris Rock Wests was on the social media.
It's not sure if Rock tried to set up West by putting up the records.
In addition, West complained to the public about ill treatment backstage due to its main clothes.
"They motivated me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hate.'
They made me move!
And they said I was deep," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how deep I am?" and said that he would take his Superman hat on, because it means "You can't decide what to do. Do you want to move on in the world?
Try with love."
At least twice of his comments were published by the public, and the SNL staff allowed him to be strictly involved, explains Variety with a comment from a person who was present: "There was a bomb in the study."
The West had been booked as replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose current boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had arrived a few days ago.
West confused many by acting with the song In Love It while he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received feedback from the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the bravest people: THANN'T LET'T THANK YOU KUY OF THE PROBLEM."
Talkshow-was Karen Hunter tweeted that the West was just "the ones he is, and it's very nice."
"But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothing or supporting his "art"), which captures and exposes an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's got a law.
And that's what we have," she added.
Before show, the rapper had announced that he had taken a change of name to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist who has changed his name, and therefore follows Didy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
The rapcolon Snoop Dogg has the name Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased musical prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Know as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington longer after toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for swinging sword into the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent mid-age fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old chess player goes out after the stereotype macho hero and says that such TV characters mean that young men often feel they have to be hard to be respected.
Kit told Sunday Times Culture that he thought there was "something wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who was recently married to his Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie on 31, admitted that the problem is "too deep in his mind".
"In the past, it's a lot of mind for me – where have we gone wrong in town with masculinity?" he said.
"If we look at the problems we are facing, what is it that we have taught young men in their upbringing?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in male toxicity due to the very male characteristics.
He continued: "What is born, and what is raised up?
What is it that young men learn from television and on the street that makes them feel that they must be men in this way?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time — how do we change it?
For it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men."
During the interview he also admitted that he would not make follow-up to Game of Thrones when the series ended next summer, and said he was "complete with bullets and horses".
Kit is involved in a replay of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother who is quiet.
The shooter discovered too recently that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best at the entire Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so it has given me my next family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kit's character, Jon Snow, is in love with the Emmy Award winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at the village of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of HIV and AIDS users.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, it is heard by the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were registered.
Most of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV this way has been reduced to something close to zero, telling Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In one year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China's LGBT environment.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT persons was reported to be a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry before or after women because of the country's conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to lack of prevention in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised free and fair access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters claims that staff have leaked data on Republican senators and solicitors against "hazardous lies" and "conspiracies"
A member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, complained on Saturday that a member of her staff had shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that the claims stemmed from websites and support from "the top right floor".
"Ladies, lies and more awful lies," Waters wrote in a Twitter store.
The published information contained allegedly home address and telephone number on the American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted on the Internet on Thursday by an unknown person at Capitol Hill. It was during a hearing in the Senate about sexual abuse against the so-called Brett Kavanaugh.
It happened after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages such as Gateway Pundit of RedState reported that the IP addresses indicated that the information had been collected by Waters' peoples, which followed the published information about a member of Water's staff, writes The Hill.
"This unfounded complaint is completely false and a direct lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, is not in any way responsible for this information doctor.
This unfounded complaint is completely false and a direct lie."
Waters' announcement received rapid criticism online, including from former press secretary in the White House Ari Fleisher.
"It's a mad denial," Fleisher wrote.
"It means that she does not have the right temperature to be a congressman.
If you're blamed for something you haven't done, you don't have to be angry.
You don't have to be rude.
There is no need to question the complainant's motives.
You have to keep the sentence."
Fleishers managed to compare Waters' reaction with the criticism of the Democrats by Kavanaugh, who were criticized for being too angry during the day of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take Waters' place in the midway election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Dad, if it's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official statement, she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and the governing authority on these fraudulent claims."
"We will ensure that the men of action are found," she continued. "And that they will be kept legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all and everyone in my staff."
Johnny English's announcement hits again – amazing spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to follow a Brexit angle in all new movies with a British legacy, and it also works for the newest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Do you want dry, Sarkastic self-sacrifice, how much trouble it is with us, to become the country's new export option?
In any case, the competent Johnny English has been allowed to make bridges again. His name is more than anything else, that he is a comical invention directed towards places where biographies don't speak English.
Of course he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a small Clouseau, a knife student Mr. Bean, and properly dressed by him who presented a single tone to Chariots of Fire Sangen at the opening ceremony of OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the world-wide and international luxury box that left chaos in his fridge after Atkinson introduced him to Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are some good moments in this last shot at the JE tribe.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter carrying a medium-age equipment, and the propellers shouted against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comics, but the humor is just amazing and amazingly superficial, especially now that more "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer convincing comics as an ingredient.
Humor makes it more likely to be directed towards children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's funny adventure isn't as inventive and focused as Atkinson's stupid film follicles in the role as Mr. Bean.
The constant current point of the film is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
An internet hacker has infiltrated England's top-level spy network and uncovered the identity of all the English agents in the field of the conduct of the responsible agent – a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a prime minister who has already suffered a complete downturn in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to do with the manuscript.
When her security advisers inform her that each active spy has been discovered, she needs to cancel someone's pension.
And of course it's Johnny English who is now a school inspector at a high school, but who secretly teaches you how to become a secret agent. There are some fun sequences here when English stands for some kind of school of rock training in spying.
English is rushed back to a crisis in Whitehall and reunited with its hard-tested previous right hand Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married with an overcrowded but well-being undercover – a role played by Vicki Pepperdine.
This is how the King's Message Service is always late Batman and Robin back when they meet Olga Kurylenkos beautiful five mortals, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is very close to getting involved with the charismatic and carefree tech billionaire Jason Volta – the game of Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough start their rather risky escapes: Dressed as servants they set fire to a former French restaurant; they create chaos as they swim on the board of Voltas lullusuyacht; and English creates pure ragnarok when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to make himself known to the Voltas house.
All cannons are created in the final sequence of the film, but how well and energetic it is than it is, there is a sense of children's television viewing about it.
It's just mediocre.
And as I couldn't avoid thinking about the other Johnny English films: couldn't the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would give his talent justice?
Labour refuses to work on a four-day job plan with an unchanged salary for the British
Jeremy Corbyn's Labor is said to consider a radical plan so that the English can enjoy a four-day job, but pay for five.
The Party will indicate that it will have business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra rest day.
This would mean that the employees would have three days a week without going to work.
Source says that the idea would agree with the party's economic objective to draw the country into a more favourable direction for workers.
The Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day job as a way for workers to benefit from an economic change.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published before the end of the year."
"It's not going to happen one day, but a quarter-day worker is a goal that fits with the party's access to change the economy for the benefit of workers and the party's overall strategy for industry."
The work would not be the first to support such an idea when the Green Party proposed a four-day workday during the election of the Parliamentary elections in 2017.
However, the objective is not supported unanimously by the Labour Party.
A speaker for the Labour Party said: "A quarter-day worker is not a party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour Minister of Shadow Finance John McDonnell used last week's party meeting to open up his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he is determined to withdraw power from "anonymous directors" and "users" in supply companies.
The plans of the Ministry of Shadow Finance also raise doubts as to whether the current shareholders in water supply companies will receive their money back as a government with Labor could "motify" them because of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to have employees in business management and to establish an inclusive equity fund to distribute 10 per cent of the private companies' share value to employees who are expected to receive up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 minutes if the FBI's study of Kavanaugh can change their vote
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has passed the final vote on his appointment to the High Court for at least one week, and it raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could get the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that was shown on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could record something that could lead them to change their position.
Kennedy became more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him, after this incident, after the charges came up, and said, "Did you do it?"
He was steelized, determined and unique."
Rather, Graham's voice looks like he's stuck in the rock.
"I have decided with regard to Brett Kavanaugh, and another would require a very violent apology," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett threw it at the strongest," Graham added with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see it would change anything."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and it has done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City is host to the Global Citizen Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive offer of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end world poverty.
The Global Citizens Festival will for the seventh time receive tens of thousands of people on Central Park's large plan, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will pay attention to the real goal of ending extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival was launched in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organization that is fighting to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP image), concerters must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, do voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a telephone call or other meaningful action that can draw attention to the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now that they have been back 12 years to achieve the goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism" – that people feel they make a difference by signing a subscription collection on the web or making a Twitter store?
Global Citizen notes that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million "actions" from their members aimed at different objectives.
They believe that these actions have urged world leaders to make binding targets and political measures equivalent to more than $37 billion, which are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 objectives and measures that had been achieved for their actions, which ran up to more than $10 billion, which had already been paid or collected.
The Group believes that these funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main objectives is The Power of Nutrition, which is started in England and is a cooperation between investors and people with a lot of difficulty. They strive to "help children to experience their full potential" and pay $35 million to alleviate nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Cities.
"With the help of the English government, donors, other countries' governments and citizens of the world like you can become a footnote in history books," said the Ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the public at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the Government of England has now pledged funds to improve the nutrition of mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 online invitations. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with nutrition advice.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions asked by the householder: "What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen wrote: "It will become a long and hard struggle, and sometimes we will snibble and make mistakes.
But as with the civil rights movement and the movement against apartheid, it will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monée are among the participants at this year's festival in New York. Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman should be host.
The United States can use its fleet to "block" Russian energy exports," says the US Interior Minister
"If necessary" Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, even in the Middle East, reveals US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria – especially where they operate on an invitation from the government – is a loan to expand the sale of their energy.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
And he says there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The US has our fleet capacity to ensure that there is free passage on the beaches, and if it is necessary, we can also block them, so we can ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit organisation that considered itself to be "the voice of the American energy consumer".
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and said they were in bond and ground.
"The economic opportunities for Iran and Russia are dealing with the use and replacement of fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony", whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These opinions are based on the intention of the Trump administration to increase the European export of liquid natural gas, which will replace Russia, which is the most cheap choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, speakers for the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 management project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin "fang".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion North Stream 2 animal management, which is expected to double the current capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of different competitive conditions and only economic considerations are due.
"I believe that we share the view that energy should not be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with the American Energy Minister Rick Perry in September.
The position of the Americans is faced with criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to mix outside the EU's energy policy with the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with having a third party involved in our energy supplies," said BDI leader Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "examines strongly" to appoint the presidential committee in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts "examines strongly" to appoint the presidential committee after the midway election, she spoke on Saturday.
At a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about stopping.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front," she said.
"After 6 November I will seriously consider setting up the presidential committee."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump to be known under the council and said that he "leads the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing at our democracy," she said.
Warren has been quoted in his criticism of Trump and his top-class renowned Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Tuesday Friday, Warren wrote: "Of course the FBI will investigate the matter before the vote."
However, an opinion from Thursday shows that the main part of Warren's own band does not think it should be set up in 2020.
According to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be set up.
32% supported the possible candidate.
The measurement showed greater feedback to former Governor Deval Patrick with 38% for and 48% against possible creation.
Other highly profiled democratic candidates discussed in connection with the presidential election in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
The message says he's reporting his final decision in January, says Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palins PTSD at a selection meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year after he reported to the army in September.
Last night he was arrested and charged with violence at home.
"What my own son goes through, after he's home, makes me contact other families that note the consequences of PTSD and other damages our soldiers bring home," she told the public at a Trump election in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his detention for "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and have become stronger. They go and think if there is respect for it, their colleagues on the ground and in the air and all the other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was sentenced to violence in the home against a woman to prevent the report of violence in the home and to be in possession of a weapon in a warlike condition, says Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the police in Vasilla.
18 states and D.C. support resistance to new asylum laws
18 states and the District of Colombia support a legal objection to a new American law that refuses asylum for victims fleeing from gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered Friday in Washington a party-dependent statement in support of an asylum seeker who is against the law is heard by NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the case of Grace vs. Sessions, submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal law, has not been published.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of the gang" had abused her, but American officials dismissed her asylum application on 20 July.
She was kept in Texas.
The state prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of American asylum seekers are from, as countries with considerable problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. Asylum Law passed a decision taken by the US Foreign Name in 2014, allowing undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia State Advocate, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new law "is removed from state, federal and international law for decades."
"The federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle is contrary to the principle," states the party-dependent statement.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law on non-immigrants damages the American economy, since it is more likely that they will become self-sufficient and "give necessary labour".
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Session's immigration judges challenged the right to give asylum to victims fleeing from violence in the home and gang violence.
"Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political position," said Sessions in its resolution of 11 June.
It has never been the idea that asylum would solve all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people all over the world face every day.
While the death rate doubles, attempts to find survivors in Palu Desperate
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
"It's very exciting," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusumuma, while she comforted her little febered boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in straight.
We need clean water."
The inhabitants now returned to their destroyed home to sort in bloody property and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were hospitalized, and hospitals, which were also affected by earthquakes on 7.5, could not follow.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke the back and the debtor, were outside Palus military hospital, where patients are treated on the basis of strong suspicions from outside.
He got tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake rocked the hotel room on the fifth floor, he shared with his wife and daughters.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was almost up against a ruined wall, I think," said Haris to Associated Press and added that his family would marry in town.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then it was settled.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador blames China for non-fine methods and propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper, a fireman's announcement was made in an American daily newspaper that fought for the benefits of American-Chinese cooperation, the US ambassador in China Beijing blamed for using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred to the Wednesday to China Daily paid an entry in the Des Moines Register – Iowa’s best seller newspaper – after having accused China of joining the Congress elections on 6 November. China rejects the apology.
American officials tell Reuters that Trump's complaint about Chinese interference in the US election marks a new phase in Washington's scaling campaign to press on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to announce to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now set up in an escaling trade war where they have, in several contexts, imposed duties on each other's imports.
China's debt rate in the trade war would have framed exporters in such countries as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, meaning Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, former governor of China, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a director of the Des Moines Register of Sunday that China "extends the use of the fine methods by driving advertising ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses its proud American tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, however, you will find only differences of opinion. And you will not get a fair picture of the different attitudes of the Chinese people to China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under strict control by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what.
Republicans make women before the midway committee with the Kavanaugh case, warn analysts
In many of the top republicans support and defend the so-called Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court against sexual abuse, analysts warn that they will experience a mood disorder in the next midway election, especially from women.
The case has put the feelings in perspective, and most Republicans have already published that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This cannot be done," said Grant Reher, professor of state science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, to The Hill on an article Saturday.
He said he doubted that the Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arisona)'s request for an 11-hour FBI investigation would slow down angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday – they don't forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, who is senior counselor and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill on Friday.
On Friday morning the demonstrators called during a demonstration at the Senate: "November comes!" when the Republicans who control the judicial committee chose to proceed with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, heard it from Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are coming to a new height," said independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg to the news media.
"People say it's already reached a high level; it's right.
But it can now be even higher, especially among women in the presidents and young voters – 18-29 years of age – who rarely vote, even though the president is not in a position to be liked."
Even prior to Ford's public complaint about the sexual abuse of the so-called Hoester, analysts had pointed out that it could provide a backlog if the Republicans continued to nomination.
"It has become a worse cause for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the committee or the final outcome of the committee, or about Kavanaugh being held accountable; it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it," points out Guy Cecil, who is president of the US Priorities – a group that supports Democrats in being elected – to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared views about who they should believe in after the testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter has a few more on their side.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh as a whole.
In addition, 38% said that they believed that Kavanaugh was either reasonable or absolutely safe during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following the invitation from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the charges submitted by Ford and at least one other, Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate board last week that Kavanaugh was fully aware of her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the so-called Hoester showed her their sex shares at a party when they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The finder of the Internet plans to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The finder of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, is launching a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological project is Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid gives users the opportunity to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee wondered that the plan with Inrupt is "world government".
"We'll have to do it now," he said about the start-up company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so people can make their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique to the personal online data collection is that it is up to the user to determine who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal power through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's managing director, John Bruce, is to collect resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps by using the available tools on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook or Google about whether they're going to change it all completely, so all their business models will suddenly become superfluous."
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a record on Media this Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupts "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called network neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will still be the director and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: Wonderful Recipients of the Victorian Course From World War I
The only priest of the English church who won the Victoria Corps by fighting during World War I will be celebrated in his home home 100 years later.
Colonel and priest Bernard Wan won the order on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglishe and Lehacourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and never knew he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday at least one of his two children was discovered at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his children, said it was "unbelievably symbolic" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's ordering business.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "by a very tight train and under strict protection from machinery and artillery."
He later walked up to the front line and led his people with the "greatest man-made" before he himself attacked a man-made and harmless three cannons.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann of 72 said that his best father's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me feel better."
He and his brother James Vann also created a cranna after the parade, which was announced by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "was very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people emphasizes the true unity."
MMA fans got up all night to see Bellator 206, but got instead of Gurli Gris
Imagine that you've been up all night to see the star-depleted Bellator 206 and then you're refused to see the main event.
There were 13 games on the program from San Jose, including six games on the main program, and they were shown through England at Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to meet each other, the sights in England were surprised as the transmission changed to show Gurli Gris.
Some were uncompensated after they had kept awake early in the morning for just this fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change to a child pornography film as "a kind of sick joke."
"This was not the appropriate content according to the law at 6 a.m. on the morning, why they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, President of Bellator's Senior City, when he was asked about the shipment.
"'Grisen Gurli', me."
Bellator's Managing Director, Scott Cooker, said they would work to include English winners in the plan ahead.
"When you're thinking about the transmission, I think we can get it to work," said Cooker.
"But the clock is six Sunday morning over there, and we don't find a solution on it before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe me, when I was changed, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, and we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it was actually the law.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We enjoyed five games instead of six, which we usually did, and we tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "minimum value" on sexuality
The Olympic poet Tom Daley says that he felt less valuable than everyone else in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it wasn't going up for him before he came into the larger classes that "all aren't like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give other "hope".
He also said he was less up to win OL after being a parent.
The usual condition of the long- running radio program, Kirsty Young, has been free for several months due to disease.
Daley was a guest in Lavern's first program and said that he felt "less worth" than everyone else in his childhood because "it was socially unacceptable to be able to like boys and girls."
He said: "Before this day, the feelings of my self-esteem and of being different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't hope everyone when they learned his sexuality to know.
The double Olympic bronze winner has become a highly profiled LGBT fighter and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a criminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky that he could live openly without negative consequences, and he wanted to give other "hope".
The third world champion said he was "surprised" when he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but she told me that the age difference had never been a problem.
He told me it's hard to find someone at the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when going through so much at such a young age – he took his first OL as 14 and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said "all his perspective" had changed."
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been all about me if I could get a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 as a 40-year-old after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had received tickets to London 2012 – when he wanted to sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there by then.
I held his hand when his breath stopped, and it turned out to me that he was not immortal when he stopped drawing the air and was dead," he said.
The following year Daley participated in the OL 2012 and won the bronze.
"I knew only that it was what I had dreamed of all my life – to cover the front of a home audience at OL. There was nothing that could overcome that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration of his first church – Proud of Heather Small – which had meant a lot during the opacitation of OL and still gave him gas skin.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Uskarp Mikkelson on the bank to Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mikkelson puts records on Sunday when he plays his 47th fight in Ryder Cup, but he's gonna do something about the form if it's not going to be a sad mess.
Mickelson, who sets record for 12 times to be involved in each 2 years of competition, was put at the bank of Captain Jim Furyk because of the four-day rounds and four-somes.
Instead of being in the center of events for the United States as usual, the 50-year-old widow had to act and practice in her game in the hope of getting up on the pigs.
Even not at the top of the career he had the most direct drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match to the road at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes wildfares shot.
And if the road wasn't big enough mouthful, mickelson will meet at the ninth battle on Sunday it will always win exactly by British Open Francesco Molinari, who has joined the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who start the 12 single champions are going strong, Michaelson's fight can be decisive.
Furyk did not express surprising confidence in his roommate.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a stick on my back, laid his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He's in Hall of Fame and has given so much to these holdings before – and also this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought he'd play more, but that's how it went, and that's what it would be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mikkelson Nick Faldos hits record for most games played in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never been able to measure itself fully with his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 winners, 20 discounts and seven outstanding ones, even though Furyk said his presence contributes to something beyond definition.
"He's funny, he's sardistic, smart, he likes to hang out with people, and he's good to have in the bathroom," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He's contributing much more than just the game."
European Captain Thomas Børn knows that big effort can disappear quickly
The European Captain Thomas Børn knows from experience that a strong implementation before the last day of Ryder Cups singles can quickly become nervous.
The dancer started in 1997 in Valderama, where a hold led by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point jump over the Americans, but was just getting caught before the finish line with a win at 1411⁄2-131/2.
"You will be reminded of ourselves that we had a fine deposit in Valderama, we had a fine deposit in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we just got exactly water," says Børn after seeing the 2018 maintenance win both 5-3 Friday and last night a total deposit at 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the crew that it's not over.
It's gonna be full of cold tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
It's not over before you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win the trust, and that's where our focus is.
I've always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other hand – the best golf players in the world."
Satisfied with his performances on a hard road added Börn: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a completely new challenge.
Tomorrow is the individual performances that count, and that's something else.
It's great to be out with a partner when it's okay, but when you're alone out there, you're tested on all parameters like golf games.
That's what players need to understand – get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you must leave your partner, because he will also get the best out of himself."
On the other hand, it appears to opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performances than in the partnership game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk has experienced himself in the last day's adventures. First of all, at the victory in Brooklyn before he died, when Europe did "Midnah's Miracle".
"I remember every word," he said, when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important battles tomorrow, but you want to have a good start, as you saw at Brooklyn, as you saw at Medinah.
When the moment has come to an end, it puts a great pressure on the intercom.
We combine our position in relation to it and put the players on the path in the order we feel about. We're trying to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been commissioned to try to lead back to Rory McIlroy in the top battle, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other European players in the first half of the series.
"I chose this group of players in this order, because I think it ensures us all the way through," said Børn about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship is being re-exploited
The latest German fleet fleet would have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the cold war. But the Germans must wait for at least one year for the cause of technical problems and an escaling price, write local media.
The introduction of the largest ship in the whole new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", was issued for the first half of 2019 according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military speaker.
The ship would have been part of the fleet in 2014, but the problem of delivery has affected the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, shall replace the old cargo from the Bremen class.
If they are aware that they will have a strong cannon, a large selection of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missions, as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the newest questionnaires is a minor need for maintenance: it would be possible to have the questionnaires away from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which, according to the report, will be given to Germany to appear as an overhaul factor – will already be parents when they are introduced, writes Die Zeit.
The failed F125-frugat created headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Weftet in Hamburg.
It was the first time the fleet had delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of major "software and hardware errors" that made the warship useless in situations of conflict.
Software error was of particular importance since the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships were to be run by a crew of 120 men – it is only half of the crew from the older Bremen frigates.
It also showed that the ship was all too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the possibility of future updates.
The 7000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware errors, the price of the project, which includes training of humanity, is also a problem.
It is said that it has reached a staggering $3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an original price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest issues are becoming even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleet is breaking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Government Defence Committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "is running dry for a clear ship".
The Ombudsman said that the problem had grown over time because the old ships were removed from use without being replaced.
He regretted that none of the students from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust leads to the secret life of the Flag Museums
A new research from a region in Scotland is trying to find out how flagermus uses the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the unique behaviour of flying mammals and will help with future conservation efforts.
The study is carried out by scientists from Scotland’s National Trust and follows the general flagermus, hard flagermus, long flagermus and water flagermus at Inverwe Gardens in Western Ross.
In particular, recording equipment is located at carefully selected places in the area to include the activities of flag museums during the season.
Data from NTS personnel and volunteers will also be collected using hand-held detectors.
In-depth analysis of sound receptions will reveal the frequency of the flanger muscles and show what kind of action they are doing.
In order to produce a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
Natural conservation consultants for NTS Rob Dewar hope that the results reveal which areas of habitat are most important and how they are used by different species.
This knowledge can help to determine the benefits of conservation efforts such as the establishment of reefs and how to best preserve forest areas for gladermus and similar species.
The number of flags in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and city-wide projects that affect the shipyards and restrict their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger. The same can be true of flue fields, chemical treatment of construction materials and attacks from pets.
Flagermus is not actually blind.
But because they primarily hunt for the night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced eco-calculation technique to find insects and fly without obstacles.
NTS, responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important seas and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the flagermus very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect shippers and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has even made Scotland's first and only dedicated flag mussel reserve in the area around Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten of Scotland's flag musars.
The owners of the area, David Thompson, say it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Three we have a really good area for flagermus," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all that good housing.
There is a lot you don't know about flagermus, so work here and elsewhere can help you understand what they need to do."
He underlines the importance of looking for flags before making maintenance tasks on property, since the destruction of a single story can kill up to 400 dogs and young people.
Flagermus is peaceful, and it is illegal to kill, generate or disturb them or their shipyards.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project leader of Bat Conservation Trust, has invited the public to join.
She said, "We still have much to learn about our flagermos and too many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations develop."
Ronaldo refuses violent complaints while lawyers are seeking German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has called violent charges against him for "fake news" and says that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to investigate the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the charges.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rapeing an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid her $375.000 to keep it secret, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the claims were published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the fifth double winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to investigate Der Spiegel because of the accusations they have called "an undisputable publication of suspicions about the privacy sphere".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral theft in a class corresponding to the charge, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event took place in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room where he was to rape her anyway according to the report in the customs office of Clark County, Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "a good guy 99% of the time" caught by "the one percent".
The paper claims that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that they agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and got her photograph of her injuries at a hospital, but later she went to an agreement outside the court because she felt "fashioned" and worried about being "publicly disfellowshipped".
The 34-year-old says she will reverse the agreement because she is still deeply affected by the alleged event.
Ronaldo faced a change from Manchester United to Real Madrid, when the event would have taken place, and changed in summer to the Italian large club Juventus for 100 million €.
Brexit: The United Kingdom's "will for always disappointed" to lose car manufacturers
Britain's "will always disappointed it" if it lost its status as world-leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said business minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "dangerous" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain had left the EU without an agreement, it would have temporarily reduced production to the factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting time at the border in the case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, where 90% of them were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop at our factory if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March," said the managing director of Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are afraid to leave the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says they'll close their mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain in the event of an outflow without agreement.
Toyota's production runs on a strict timetable where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement of 29 March, there could be problems at the border which, according to the car industry, could lead to delays and shortcomings.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day's production at the Derbyshire factory and then the production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says that Theresa Mays Checkers' future EU negotiations plan is "consolidated so that these border checks are precisely avoided."
"We must have an agreement. We will have the best agreement that not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today's Programme.
"The views of Toyota and other manufacturers point out that we must be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would have been stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce the competitiveness of the factory, which would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint member of the factory, says that his members become more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs are gone, they won't come back."
A government speaker said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may have been delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with the local Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein can "be exhausted for a week more", as the report about the top-nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is looking at the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller in his investigation of the Russian electoral mix, relations between Trump's assistants and Russia and the President's potential impediment to the course of the court.
Whether Trump will defend the local minister of justice and thereby risk Mueller's independence has been a fighter in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times wrote that Rosenstein had considered carrying a microphone to hold talks with Trump and the possibility of suspending the President through paragraph 25.
Rosenstein was rebuffed by the news.
But last morning he went to the White House, and the back went up to say.
Instead, we agreed on a Thursday meeting with Trump, which was currently in the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "not prefer" to four Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a meeting with the Senate's judicial hearing, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse, would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's decision.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was at Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked to meet with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be moved for a week with everything that's going on in the top.
But we have to see, and I like keeping the press up-to-date."
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings was not due to TV reporters' game for the gallery, but added, "I'm not surprised that they're playing in the camera."
She said that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The President is asking more questions from the press than any president before him," she said and added without citing a source: "We have seen the numbers."
Press meetings will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to give a rich chance for this, and you've seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it's going to be in the place of the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often asks questions when leaving the White House or participating in open hearings or press meetings with high-end guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure before the present journalists.
Health ministers contact EU health workers in Scotland after Brexit's concerns
The Ministry of Health has written to the EU-level staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish them to follow Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than half a year before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to pay for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its public sector.
In her letter Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the withdrawal continued, and it appears that decisions are expected to be made next year.
However, the British Government has also increased their preparation for any Brexit without an agreement.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for you all.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I value this effort, whatever their nationality, each of the staff has done.
Members from and outside the EU come with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care for the benefit of patients and local communities.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we would love to have you stay.
Christion Abercrombie gets acute surgery after major damage
Lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was operated after having suffered some major damage during the 31-27 day of landing to Vanderbilt Commodes, explains it from Tennessee Mike Organ.
First trainer for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the event took place before the break.
"He went out to the side line and just fell out there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oil on the sideline before they put him on a bar and brought him into further examination.
A speaker from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombies' operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was understood.
Harris added that there is not "no details about the type or extent of the damage yet", and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he touched the damage.
Abercrombie studies in the second year and is in progress with her first season in Tennessee State after a change from Illinois.
He had five thanks on Saturday before he left the fight, which gives him 18 thanks this whole season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp charges when they buy houses in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp tax when they buy an estate in the United Kingdom. The extra money is to help the homeless according to the conservative party.
This draw must measure Corby's success by attracting young voters.
The higher stamp tax will cover those who do not pay taxes in Britain.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to receive £120 million a year for homeless people.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp charge when they buy properties in Britain for the benefit of the homeless.
The drawing will be considered as an attempt to respond to Jeremy Corbyn's success by attracting young voters with promises of cheaper dwellings and following them with the highest income.
The increase in the stamp tax will cover persons and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain.
The extra fee imposed above the current stamp tax and the higher levels introduced two years ago on wholesale purchases and purchases may be up to 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by people living abroad, which makes prices rise and make it harder for first-time buyers to get a feed on the housing market.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become 'survival cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new legislative proposal will only take weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in stamp tax to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping their property prices up by buying reasons they don't use. He asked May to drop the allowances on cheap housing to solve the "dangerous housing situation in the United Kingdom."
Corbyn has proposed an eye-opening number of housing reforms, including the control of rental prices and the withdrawal of the opportunity of the contractor to place people on the road if they comply with the lease contract.
He will also strengthen the opportunity to conduct public housing.
May said: "In the last year I said that I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for each generation.
And it means repair our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be seen that it is as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the United Kingdom to buy housing as for hard-working Britain.
For all too many, the dream of owning a home has become too remote, and the uncertainty of sleeping on the street is still too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's trainer"
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is at a time to become Scotland's trainer.
The 42nd Shot enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the North East, which now has a third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a fight with the B-hold, and that was it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up to see Scotland on Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it has always been in me.
However, it would only arise if I had succeeded in training clubs."
Ross' former trainers for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach for Alloa Athletic says he had no interest in following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I intend to succeed if I can get this club back in Premier League."
Apart from the structure and facilities of this club, it is certainly home in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I'll probably just see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years in the career that trains after a period of attending training in Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart training.
Then he helped Allao to return after being smoked in the third best series and transformed St. Mirren from the draw stroke into a title winner for the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It must have been a real difference," he recalls about the time in Allao.
"I sincerely thought that training was right for me, more right than being a player.
That sounds amazing because I made it fine, served wisely and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
There's still the kind of stress and pressure that trains, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I've done it. I haven't had any more satisfaction with myself throughout my adult life."

The best time for a beer is Saturday at 17:30 p.m., shows the study
This summer’s heat wave has increased the performance of England’s pubs, but has set restaurant trees under greater pressure.
The sale of pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while the sale in restaurants has gone down by 4.8%, shows numbers.
Peter Martin, who is a business consultant at CGA and has collected the figures, said: "The continued Sunshine and England's unexpected long VM have meant that July follows June's pattern, where the pubs experienced 2.8% more sales than the restaurants are more severely hit now.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on the sale of beverages made it clear best and experienced progress corresponding to the return of restaurants.
Pubber with focus on food leads in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
It looks like people just want something to drink.
On average of pub and barcodes, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6 % per month, while the food fell by 3.3 %."
Paul Newman, who analyzes the service sector, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the external-from-home market, weather and major social or sports events are the main factors.
It is no surprise that restaurants are still fighting, although a decline in sales of 4.8% per year will result in real bad rising costs.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will give a hard-pressed posterium."
The total increase in sales total for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7% in July, which shows the fall in newly started fires.
Caffer Peach Tracker, which monitors the sale of English pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is more than €9 billion, and they are leading in the area.
Every fifth child has a secret account on social media that they hide for their parents
Each fifth child – down to 11 years of age – has a secret account on social media, which they hide from their parents and teachers, shows research.
A study of 20,000 students in the 4th-9th class reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear of sexual harassment
20 % of students said they had a "main account" that they could show their parents.
Every five children up to 11 years of age create an account on the social media they hide for adults.
A survey of 20,000 students from the 4th class reveals violent growth in the "false Insta" account – a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The news has increased the fear of sexual harassment.
20% of the students said they had a "main account" that they could show their parents while they are also private.
A mother, who fell over her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, then a teenager who urged others "to rape me".
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Head Mistakes' Conference for private schools (HMC) found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles from which half agreed to have a private account.
The leader of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's scary that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers can't find them.
Eiylh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilyh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics at the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athletes, and President Ian Bettie described the exchange as a good opportunity for those who make decisions on sport to benefit from her great 10-year international experience.
"Eilidh enjoys a great deal of consideration in the Atlantic world in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the rest of the world, and we are sure that Scotland's athletes will be able to benefit from having her in the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope I can contribute and help out a direction for sport in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four OL gold medals in the 200 and 400 metres OL in Atlanta in 1996, and who is now often a commentator for BBC, could not follow a transitional ischemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: "A month ago I was hit by an accident.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that the time would show if I wanted to get up there and how much.
It's been hard work, but I'm very fast, I've learned to go back and do agile exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
Advertising for breast pumps that compare mothers with dogs gets mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared its opinions online with a commercial that compares breast-feeding mothers with cows that are maltreated.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be "the first soundless breast pump in the world," the technological consumer magazine has published a sarcastic music video-inspired advertising to show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers.
Four real moms dance in a cosal that is filled with pride, to a song where it sounds like, "Yes, I paint myself, but you don't see any hall" and "If you hadn't noticed it, it's not over here, it's my breasts."
"Pum it out, pump it out, feed my child, pump it out, pump it out, paint my bar. "
But the advertising that has been published on the company's Facebook page has led to online controversy.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the lakes. Many say it makes fun of "the fears" at the dairy industry.
"The very bad decision to use leads to advertising for this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and fed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth," wrote one user.
Elvie's breast pump passes discreet in an amme-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another wrote: "Probably traumatic for both mother and child.
But why don't you use them to advertise for a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added, "It's like an insensitive advertising."
One woman admitted that she seemed to be singing "unbelievably mother."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were still begging, I'd have had one.
Aming made me feel exactly like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a fun commercial directed against mothers who pump milk (often on their workplace or on toilets) and feel like 'cure'.
It's not a commercial that Russians or criticises the milk industry."
At the end of the video, women discover that they've danced with the discreet pumps in their beers.
The concept behind the advertising is based on the fact that many women who smoke say they feel like they are driving.
The pump from Elvie is completely soundless, has no pipes or snakes and passes through the discrepancy in an amme-bé, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, who is a partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a sharp and provocative launch.
By bringing a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and milk cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while we demonstrated in a consistent and conscious way the freedom that the new pump can give."
It's not the first time that Elvie's pump has created headlines.
In London Fashion Week a mother went to two catwalks for Martha Jakubowski while she used the product.
More than a hundred migrant children secretly moved to the border of Texas
The number of abandoned migrant children has been explosiond, although the number of border crossings has not changed. It is due, in part, to a more rigorous rhetoric and the firmer law of the Trump administration that makes it more difficult to place children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared for their ability to stay in the country by standing up and taking a stand against a child.
The risk of sending home increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, witnessed to the Congress and told them that they had arrested several persons who were seeking to sponsor innocent minors.
The management later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had clear criminal certificates.
"At least 80% of those who are sponsors or members of sponsors' households are illegal in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still looking for those people," said Albence.
In an attempt to address children’s cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to sit in court within one month of their detention.
Many use video calls instead of themselves to meet up and talk their case for legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those who are convicted of unlawful residences shall be deported quickly.
The longer the children become pregnant, the higher the likelihood that they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which may lead to a violent accident or a flight trial, it is heard from assistants and reports from the system in recent months.
Lawyers for better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced at large facilities such as Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to keep an eye on the suffering of a child.
They added that moving to a settlement without any mental preparation or opportunity to say good-bye to friends can bring up dreams that many are already fighting.
Syria informs the US, French and Turkish 'industrial forces' that they must withdraw immediately.
When Syria's Foreign Minister, Walid al-Mouelem, spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked the Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, also Vice-President, said that the presence of foreign forces in the country is illegal and under the pretext of combating terrorism, and they will "keep meeting with similar means."
"They shall return immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem stressed that the war against terror "was almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been fled from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this decisive war until we have cleansed all Syrian areas" for both terrorist groups and "legal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian-Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war - torn country.
In the refugee area, Moualem said that the conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unreasonably fear", which had given the refugees to be away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate these shipments," he said.
"They policy what should be a purely humanitarian situation."
The United States and the EU have warned that aid will not be made available to rebuild the country prior to a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to establish a buffer zone in the last major powered by Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a major attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia against the province where three million people live.
However, Moulalem stressed that the agreement had "clearer deadline" and expressed the hope that military actions would follow Jihadists from the Nusra Front, a group of al-Qaeda firemen who "would be eliminated".
The United Nations delegation Staffan de Mistura hopes to call on the new committee's first meeting to outline a post-war constitution for Syria and the path to a election. The committee consists of government and opposition members.
Moualem has laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee and has said that the work of the panel must be limited to "examination the legislation of the current constitution", and warned against interfering.
That's why Trump wins another presidential period
From the logic, Trump is likely to be re-elected in 2020, unless the case of the government and the scandals closes his presidential period before the time when many liberals hope for it.
"The most dramatic conclusion of a presidential period ever!"
Currently, there is no sign of sedentary weakness.
Since 2014, the number of seats in the best sent time has been almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million winnings in the best sent time compared to 1.7 million winnings four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show has most winnings up to 3.5 million tonight with big news.
"It's a show that people are attracted by because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, who led the ABC drama Designed Survivor about a leader of the cabinet, who becomes president after an attack destroying Congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy author and author behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a tax in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he wanted to vote on Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Before he gets me to cry,' said Scowell.
The cheese has a maintenance value.
But contrary to all other TV programs, the stories from Washington can decide between Roe and Wade whether refugee families can reunite and the health of the world economy.
Changing channels is only the most privileged.
And yet it is more than being informed of citizens when you see six-hour panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "diber background", when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's science guide for $15,000 ("adhesived with hybrids", wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' living descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
In any case, I will never see Super Mario the same way.
"One of the things that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, managing director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pown Stars", about Trump show's rotating crew and daily surprises (scanning with N.F.L., rose to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a section, you're fired.
When I got in Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC, until he got CNN.
He could not get away with himself; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who would be heard in the Senate's judicial committee, and the future of the Supreme Court would be decided.
"I can remember when we made all these shows earlier, and people said, 'It's the beginning of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large summers lead to the close midway selection to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania 17 district receives large sums of money, as a result of a comparison of two "Congressional Districts" fighting two congressmen on the same seat.
This recent urban district in Pittsburgh creates problems for the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another side member of Congress, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which prevails strongly with the new 17.
The courts were made, after the University of Pennsylvania in January, to consider that the old district was legally established in favour of the Republicans.
The fight on the new 17th district has launched a fight on economic resources between the major parties' committees, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb was known in Pennsylvania after a small victory in a high-security election in March for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
The seat has been on the hands of the Republicans for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for support to China but not determined
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing with a few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners beat Trump's management service.
Ambassadors from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call leading American diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, Minister for Foreign Affairs's speechwoman in a statement earlier this month.
But it was only El Salvador who was punished. They received about $140 million from the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts of economic aid and restrictions on domestic aid, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and mortality statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials issued a summit on security and economic development, which would continue to be the last year's meeting considered to be a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, the top public made it clear that they wanted to have the conference to take place anyway and therefore dropped the thought of punishment to El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should speak to the conference scheduled for mid-October to send a signal on the importance of the Americans present at the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new severe demands or punishments from Washington.
A speaker for Bolton from the White House did not want to comment on the details of the case described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who wanted to talk about internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an incomprehensible analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke from an anonymous condition.
History
The next obstacle could well be the special complainant Robert Mueller's report on the possible prevention of Trump's research, which is considered and publicly available.
Following that, Mueller will also direct his research on whether the Trump campaign secretly cooperated with Russia on the attack on the election.
If the Congress were to arrive at new hands, Trump would probably be held responsible while he was preparing to meet the voters again and, of course, at the time, a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not say that Trumps is absolutely inevitable – and the same applies to his opposition in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we must all make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938 German officers were ready to join a state-of-the-art coup against Hitler, if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the checklaws in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the long blood stream.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history is turning, and the irrefutable march of democracy to or from.
In the United States there are now too many of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who decides the future for Mueller's research, Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein?
The seat of Rosenstein has been warm since the current newspaper could announce that he had proposed to make the president's appointment secret last year and attached his suitability to the Ombudsman.
According to Rosenstein, The Times production is overcrowded.
"How do we react if the recent research by the F.B.I.'s investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is conducted or not properly implemented – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court in spite of credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we vote in the middle-way committee for a convention that will hold Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can.
My mother was a Czech-Low Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, who once owned my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me out 60 years later to wear a satellite light on the table with the hacker.
How can I be more optimistic than that in the bag?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic ahead of the fight against SK Rapid Vienna
Rangers takes on Thursday against SK Rapid Vienna. After the impressive unexpected result in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, they will have a victory against the Austrians to come forward from Group G of Europe League.
A rapist prevented middle-way player Graham Dorrans from having a weekend before the 2-2 battle against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a jumpboard for something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villar Real is a good place," said the 31st-year-old.
"We went to the fight with the faith that we could get something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could've taken the stick home, but all of it was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and was the best.
On Thursday, there will be another big European evening.
We hope to get three points, but it will be hard because they got a good outcome in the final fight, but with the public behind us I'm sure we can press them and get a good outcome.
The last year has been hard because of everything that has happened with my injuries and the changes in the club, but the vote is good now.
It's good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can run now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Fear of pension saving makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the study participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, only a few were talking to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the UN wide survey said that they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"Most want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the United Nations Life Insurance Company.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not tell them your wishes at the right time.
Use your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These options can be crucial factors for the costs.
Ask your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term insurance can be financed, among other things, by means of a traditional long-term insurance policy, cash-payment insurance or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have the economy.
Get organized the legal documents: Take the legal matches in the course.
Get a full-time job so you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and medical personnel comply with your wishes, if you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider, too, an economic completeness.
In such a case, you appoint a trusted person who can make economic decisions and ensure that your accounts are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that one of your elderly parents is in need of medical help and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergy?
Get all these details down in writing, so you're done.
"This is not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Get the plan in place."
A man shot several times with an airport in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an airport on his way home from a tour of town.
The victim was in the 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, middle floor and hand.
The officer describes the shooting, which took place about 02:30, as "fully random".
The victim didn't see the maker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police call witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Since the communication routes are out of play, emergency aid workers have not been able to receive information from the Doghara government, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the earth’s epicenter of 7.5.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake.
Here are some facts about Palu and Dodhara, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawese province and is located in the heart of a small hole on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population figure of 379,800.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Dothraa is a kingdom that extends over more than 300 km coast on the northwest side of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population figure of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the central Sulawesian economy, particularly in the coastal area of Doghía.
Nickel invention is also important in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Dodhaa have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed several hundred homes in Donghara.
In 1996 Dodhaa was again hit by a tsunami that killed you.
Indonesia is seismologically on the so-called volcanic eruption in the Pacific and is regularly covered by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December which struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, including over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra last March and first April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake measuring 6.8 hit southern Java, Indonesia’s nearest most people’s island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A earthquake measuring 7,5 struck one of the Mintawai islands from Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres, destroying thousands of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: An overland earthquake hit Pidie Jaya's government in Aceh and spread destruction and panic as the population was reminded of the 2004 devastating earthquake and tsunami.
A tsunami was not released this time, but more than 100 were killed by the combined buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquake hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily on the beach.
Sarah Palin's oldest son intended for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor in Alaska and Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, preventing the notification of domestic violence and in order to oppose detention, according to the report sent by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, he received the phone from a woman when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is a commodity prison in the Mat-Su Pretreal Facility with a bailout of $500 without security, KTUU reports.
He was appointed to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not quite guilty," reports the network.
Palin is targeted for three Class A offences that can lead to a prison term of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been targeted for a Class B violation, which can lead to a penalty on a single day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that Palin's been targeted for legal violations.
In December 2017 he was charged with having violated his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently under review at Alaska's Veteran Court.
In January 2016 he was sentenced to violence in the home to prevent the notification of a violent crime in the home and the possession of weapons in the affected state of the event.
His girlfriend blamed him for giving her a blow in her face.
In 2016 Sarah Palin was criticised by veterinary groups after explaining his son’s violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his exhibition in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people have been killed, after a earthquake on Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi fell.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed several hundred homes.
The area is without electricity and communications, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the south of central Sulawesi, north of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media there are videos that are currently showing where the earth is covered.
Hundreds of people were gathered to a beach party in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public prosecutors are trying to get terrorist suspects in NYC who are rarely sentenced to death
Public prosecutors are trying to prosecute the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of terrorist activity in New York City, who killed eight people – a rare punishment that was finally convicted of a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov reportedly used a rental car from the construction market Home Depot to launch an attack on a bicycle track along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and bicycles who came along were killed.
As a basis for the death penalty, the complainants must prove that Saipov "serious" killed the eight victims and "seriously" causing serious personal injury. This is required by the declaration of intentional death penalty in the southern district of New York.
According to the legal document, the death penalty is a possible result of both these purposes.
Several weeks after the attack, a state juror could present Saipov for an interview with 22 points. Among them were eight complaints of murder in connection with gangs, which are typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "wide planning and preparations," the prosecutors said and described Saipov's performance as "unreasonable, abusive and depressed."
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal damage, physical damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci," says the statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since New York's southern district was last reported in a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers, but ended up being sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was later pronounced in a state case in New York in 1953. The couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were convicted of spying on behalf of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenberg pair was held in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and showed, according to the legal documents, no sign of the dates and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the researchers that he had done well with his actions.
According to the complaint, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to get the ISIS flag up at his hospital, told the officials.
He has committed himself to the 22nd point of the complaint.
David Patton, one of the Saipov's public defenders, announced that the complainants 'of course were disappointed' in their decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept an arrest and life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma for all the involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the complainants not to go after the death penalty.
The Conservative Minister believes that NIGEL FARGE should take over Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's heritage" during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former UKIP leader said the politicians had to be able to "mark the press" from the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May's own ministers said Farage should take over the negotiations with the EU.
The MEP Peter Bone said to the Birmingham demonstration that Britain would "be out now" if Farage had been Brexit dealers.
May’s challenge in creating a collection in the deeply split party is stressed by conservative retaining participants in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan on track under attack by both Brexits, Remainers and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite her return, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – and therefore force the Eurosceptics and Labor to choose between her package or "kaos".
To demonstrate Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced that he wanted to break the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now," he said.
The minister from Wellingborough added: "I want to fight for Brexit, but we're going to shoot Chechers."
On the basis of his EU opposition, he said: "We did not fight the world war to be under-ordered.
We will determine our own laws in our own country."
Bones refused that the public's attitude would have changed since the 2016 vote: "that the British people would have changed their mind and would like to be in the EU is completely wrong."
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told the journalists: "I only say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The checks plan is unpopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us elected.
Kill Chequers now, and start listening.'
As a pointed comment to May, she added: "The Prime Minister keeps their job when they keep their promises."
Farage said that politicians should be able to "mark the press" if they fail the vote in 2016.
"Now this is a question of confidence between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They will betray Brexit, but we are assembled to tell them that we will not let them go."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must ensure that the political class that is on the verge of defeating Brexit can mark the press.
"We mobilize the people's heritage here in the country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we don't stop before we become independent, self-governing and proud of Great Britain."
Imnes marked remains through Birmingham before a totimimer took place in the city.
Distributed activists competed with Conservative Mod Brexit runners after the formation of the group this weekend.
The Labour colleague Lord Adonis did before the meeting with the safety problems with the conservative party app.
"It is the people who claim to have control over the IT systems and technology of Canada, to border controls, to free trade without borders in Ireland," he said.
"It's totally green.
There's nothing called a good Brexit," he added.
Warren "extremely overthinks" to appoint the presidential committee
Member of the House of Representatives, Senator Elizabeth Warren "examines strongly to appoint the presidential committee" after the midway election in November.
According to Boston Globe, the democracy from Massachusetts spoke about its future during a council meeting on Saturday in the Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticised Donald Trump, will try to win a reelection against the state's Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trumps Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
You've been speculating if she wanted to challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting at Holyoke Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the voters at the Council Hall, since Trump took over his office.
A participant asked her if she was planning to appoint the presidential committee.
Warren replied that it is time for "women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front."
Maintenance of LSU's Sims
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana reported on Saturday that a suspect of the shooting was arrested on the wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
The Baton Rouge police reported that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday for an ET news meeting at 11.
On Friday they had released a video of the shooting to ask for help in identifying a man on the tapes.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was hit by a blow in his head and killed by the damage," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, according to the media 247sports.
Wayde got in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was heard and allowed to be present, with a gun and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without problems and is now at the police station in the East Baton Rouge district.
Sims was a two-foot high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. In the last season he played 32 games, started in ten and played in average 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per fight.
Russia's great prize: Lewis Hamilton is close to the world champion, after team orders he wins over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified himself before Lewis Hamilton Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a decisive role in the course.
From the driver’s position, Bottas was given a good start and was close to raising Hamilton completely because he defended his position in the first two rows and invited Witnesses to attack his roommate.
The witness ran as the first one, and allowed Hamilton to fight the worst traffic in the field, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes car went in a turn later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back before, as the Ferrari driver had to leave the subway after a double defense at the third crossing.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven after the first round on his 21-year-old birthday.
Then he led in a large part of the course when he refused to change coverage in an attempt to take Kimi Raikkon's fourth place.
He had to go into pit on the 44th round, but could not increase the pace of the last eight rounds, why the Raikkonen assured the fourth place.
"It's a hard day because Valtteri did it great all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me through.
The holder did an amazing job to make us both the first and the second place," Hamilton said.
Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump addressed Senator Diane Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday because she insisted that she had not finished her letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the so-called High Commissioner Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At an election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the statement made by Ford before the US Senate ruling, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "unlawful and hostile and unfair".
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and angry and
"When you look at opinions and doctors, and then they say "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Diane Feinstein, was it you who made it?
Remember her answer... it was you who drew the document--"oh, uh, what?
No, no.
I haven't done anything."
Hov, just a second.
No, we haven't done anything," he added in a simulation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter of Ford's charges against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was made in September – but Feinstein complained that the doctor came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's charges, and I haven't finished her story," said Feinstein to the committee according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I've done it."
But her condemnation was not well received by the President, who said during the hearing day: "I tell you that it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
In the President's continued defense of the nominated Supreme Court, which has been charged with sexual abuse by three women, Trump proposed that the Democrats use their own charges to gain their own case.
"They don't throw any means in their efforts to take back power.
You can see the evilness, the contradictions they are equal to who they are supposed to dream of in order to get power and control," said the President in Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars did it well again after Friday's lost Elite League fight against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return battle in Dundee this Saturday.
Giants quickly came forward with two targets of attack from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie appeared on their way home before Dwyer brought Giants before.
Francois Bouchard compared to Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won the victory with two more targets.
It was the third Elite League landing for Adam Keef's holding, which came from behind to kill Dundee 2-1 in the war of Friday in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides where Giants went out as knights in the three previous battles.
Dwyer released in four minutes at 3:35 from an assistant from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as assistant, when Beauvillier doubled the performance four minutes later.
During a first period of work, Sullivan returned home at 13:10, before Matt Marquartt stood behind Cownie's equation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Giants came forward at first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The housekeeper regrouped, and Bouchard re-compensated with a great target at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the fight late in the second period, and he won the winner with his fifth goal by half through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four out of their five battles, are home in Milton Keynes for their next fight on Friday.
Aeroplanes died to ensure that hundreds of passengers avoided earthquakes
A flight leader in Indonesia was totally killed after he died to ensure that a flight with several hundred passengers was safe.
More than 800 people are dead and many are missing, after a larger earthquake on Friday the Sulawasi island hit and dissolved a tsunami.
The area is still under heavy siege, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agungs fled for life, he refused to leave his place in the weak control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was back in his place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the starting line, was safe in the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was working together.
He died in the hospital later.
Talsmand for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said according to Australian ABC News that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikapan in Kalimantan, which would bring him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him in the morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We're sunflowers," he added.
The authorities fear that the death rate can reach several thousand, and the country’s disaster preparedness indicates that access to the cities of Doghía, Sig and Boutong is limited.
"The death rate is expected to rise because there are still many similarities in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them," said the speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six metres high waves have destroyed Palu, which holds a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aeroplanes fly emergency aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusumuma, said to Sky News: "A new ambulance comes every minute.
There's a lack of clean water.
All the shops are packed."
Jan Gelfand, head of International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cors is working hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to do.
It's already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work around the day to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" he said according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier this year, where more than 550 people were killed.
Aeroplane in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the flight control in the Law
The airline behind the plane that was operating in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says that a man is missing, although it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were evacuated from the approaching flight.
According to a press release, Air Niugini says that it was not possible to locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The company announced that it had cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The air carrier has not returned to requests for more information on the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Locals were to save the other passengers and crew, after the plane hit the water while landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
The officials said on Friday that seven people were being taken to the hospital.
The airline says that six passengers were at the hospital until Saturday and that they were all in a stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the government and the precise order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say that the plane landed in the Law on the road.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane was flying through the landing path.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
"That was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and other passengers could go to life to get to the emergency exits on the approaching flight.
He said that the crew was panicking and screaming and that he had had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who worked to renew a boat in the vicinity also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to carry people in the country before the plane dropped about 30 feet [30 m] deep.
Data from Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines over the last two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts set a time line for the night when a woman was burned alive
The complainant concluded his evidence on Saturday during the complaint for a man charged with burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analysts of the U.S. Ministry of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed several hours as experts in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used tele-data to compile the past of the 29-year-old charged Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location data from several different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was in conflict with his previous claim, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police visited Sanford.
Sanford sat in the witness hospital on Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was right when he said he was in Sanford's truck last night, Sanford said he was "laugh because my truck was in Nashville".
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said he had met Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at a time after Chambers' death Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defence is intended to initiate its proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that same day.
The High Width: What is political hippie?
A hipptrio wants to challenge the negative view of the general by giving their music positive messages.
The High Width of Bristol believes that hipop has moved away from its origin with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hippies popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a revival in Britain because of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
What kind of person?!
Baby girl in New York looking for a couple after dating with "racist" text
A baby girl in New York is looking for a couple of discriminatory guys after having sent a text message by an error from the mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple claimed to be racist, but compared the search to "pressure".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who is a mother to two, expressed his desire to find out that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met on her first working day in 2016.
"NOEEEEEEEEEJ, NOT A SORTWEEN PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, she Fired the "flying" Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice and said that their former childhoods, such as African-American, had been bad for her work and that she instead expected a Filipino, according to New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home to a Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice seeks compensation for the fire and compensation for 350 dollars a day for the six months she would have settled with the family, although this was agreed without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't be allowed to do this," she said to the newspaper on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves that they are not racist and that Maurice's fire was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after having insulted her.
"My wife was here to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco to The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone you've been unappreciated about, even though it was a mistake?
Your baby?
"To be honest."
Plasco compared the search target to "pressure", and that his wife had been born two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you really looking for someone like that?
It is not particularly friendly," added the investment adviser.
Although the case is still under way, the Court of Justice has already dismissed the parity on social media and deplores their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's version feared that readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was taken to be released, said about the letter: “It’s hard to imagine being the one who reads it for the first time before it was released.
It's just fun to read now when you know how popular Paddington became."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at BBC before he was inspired to write the book on a small suit, would have been optimistic even though his story was rejected, and that the 60-year year for the publication of the books was "biter sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all history was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't want to talk," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it felt almost like if you had a child who got something: you're proud of them, even though it's not your reward.
I don't think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Although it was his work and his fantasy, he used to say it was Paddington's fault."
I told you about dead girls over the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called with the same room to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a call from Nad that she would die within the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you later.
The medicine she had received to keep her heart running was slowly losing their effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now she shut down her body.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to take me together."
Finally, the nursing Ednan-Laperouse went on board the plane with the other passengers who did not know what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I shook my head, and the tears continued to run.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Caring women are trying to stop suicide shoppers
Two women who have lost their own lives are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have drawn up a map on a walaisic bridge with inspiring messages and telephone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he got depressed and 18, when he started killing himself.
"I don't want any parents to experience the sadness I experience every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
"His smile was known by everyone.
People said that his smile lighted up the room."
He stopped working before he died because he was really crazy.
In 2014, it was Tyler's 11-year-old brother who found him when he had taken his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid if it's spreading."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "Tell people there's someone out there you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your thoughts yourself – you need to talk to someone."
Sharon Davis' many-year-old friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost his boyfriend over 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about being sorry about it or depressed or something," she said.
"A few days before Christmas he began to change.
When the children opened their gifts, he didn't even have any contact with them."
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to come through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
We've been dreaming of each other.
But we all have to continue and fight together."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unclear while the FBI is launching an investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked about – a limited time-limited study with limited scope – we might have some agreement," Fleke said on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee "falled from the back" in the middle of the determined party situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not have the FBI carried out their investigation?
Their retention is due to weight.
The midway elections are only five weeks away on 6 November, and if the Republicans, which are expected to make themselves worse, will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to choose to be the highest judge in the country.
George W. Bush has called on senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has completed its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice-President Mike Pence the decisive vote and elect him to the High Court.
Number of North Korean kidnappers 'faller' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean settlers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean law.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Ministry of Collection and said that there were 1.127 over the last year in comparison with 2.706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human mammoths were contributing to the amended figures.
Pyongyang has not given any official comments.
In the long run, most of North Korea's settlers are currently offered citizenship in South Korea.
The Government of South Korea claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them fly through China, which has the longest border support to North Korea, which is easier to cross than the highly populated demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the camps illegal immigrants and not refugees, so they are often forced to leave.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is technically still in war – has improved significantly over the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to discuss the beach negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happens after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against a nuclear-free Korea at an overall level.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho gave American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Untrusted in the United States there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we will rely on our own hands," said Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh for "hysterical" and says he's not worthy of the high school.
President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who has been appointed to the Supreme Court for "hysterical" and said that his temperature was not suitable for the High Court.
Pelosis comment came in an interview on Saturday to Texas Tribune Festival in Austin in Texas.
"I couldn't have been thinking that if a woman had acted in that way, she would have been called hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to the witness of Kavanaugh before the Senate's ruling on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the guilt that he had committed a sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, and when he spoke of his family and years in high school, he almost cried and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the charges against him "gross and a coordinated opposition" organized by the left-hand side, which was angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the president's post in 2016.
Pelosi said that she thought that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the upper room because it showed that he was taken over by the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the opinions and the way he followed Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi vek except when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to a state law if he is confirmed and if the Democrats get more in the House of Representatives.
"I mean, if he doesn't speak the truth about Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but definitely also in the court he's sitting right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently sitting as judges at the Court of Appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democracy she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions regarding Obama's health reform or the abolition of Roe v. Wade because he was considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer any questions as to whether he wanted to reverse certain previous high-level decisions.
"It doesn't have to happen that a hysterical, predicated person has to fight a job that judges and expects us to say 'yes, it's not just funny'," said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It is a fair outcome, the anger of months and years, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
She continued: "I got a great feedback from a woman who was the boss who said that she was also crying when she was angry but that she developed a technique that meant that when she became angry and began to cry, she would say to the one she was talking to: "You might think I'm sorry about it because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just got to know.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are misunderstood inside and outside.
One of my clearest memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with a weight of men, where I often cry out of anger, where I was taken by the neck of an older woman – a cold boss, which I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out on the stairs.
"You must never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're hot.
They'll think you're sorry about it, and they'll be glad they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Colorado Congress of Democrats, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was discovered to have a business on a boat named Monkey Business and considered himself a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came up with the idea that she could just stand up as a presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a particularly thought-out decision," she said to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the course, and they definitely did not need another candidate.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was back with funding, so she promised she wouldn't participate unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost before.
She discovered that some of her support, which gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I can get rid of it?" she thought.
When she said she didn’t want to get up, she was overwhelmed by feelings — gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so hard to travel money and get out to voters instead of electoral men, and anger over sexism — that she got a lump in her throat.
"You could believe I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls how the press responded to her.
"You should think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking what you're going to write on my gravestone?
"She's crying"?
So the trade war between the United States and China can be a benefit to Beijing
The opening of the trade war between the United States and China was high, and although the battle far from being overcome, division between the countries can be a benefit for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump dismissed the first warning grant earlier this year by placing duty on important Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest increase this week with new customs duties affecting goods of a value of $200 billion is in principle half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has made every effort, at the latest by taxing between 5 and 10 % of US goods for $60 billion.
China has the responsibility to follow the United States all the way, and the world’s next largest economy is probably not going to give at the same time.
If it gets Washington to withdraw its demands, it means they're giving up, but for China's President Xi Jinping, it's going to be too hard to move for the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US pressure in the trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can make a grave mistake for an economy that can come out of control in both countries, and it is actually much more dangerous than you thought," said Abigail Grace, a research worker focusing on Asia at the Centre for New American Security.
Syria's 'clear' to receive refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says that the country is ready for the return of refugees and asks for help to build up the country that has been destroyed by the more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouelem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation is more stable and certainly thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government has continued to control the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore normal status.
All conditions are now in place so that refugees can return to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily life and bread.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have been fled from the country since 2011, where the war began.
Another six million people who are still in the country need emergency help.
Al-Mouelem said that the Syrian government would like to help rebuild the host country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that were involved in supporting the opposition.
Europe secures Ryder Cup-Seir in Paris
The European team has won Ryder Cup 2018 and killed the American team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National without Paris.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophies back when Captain Thomas Björn's crew arrived at the 14.5 points, which required killing the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had it hard in most of the tournament, shot his drive in the sea on a couple of 3 on 16 hills, which led him to lose his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari was well finished in all rounds and became 1 out of all 4 players who have received 5-0-0 since 1979, where the current format of the tournament began.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 57-4 of the lowest ranked European players, Danish Thorbjörn Olesen.
No. 1 on the World ranking list, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the baggage, Spain Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't cry normally, but today I can't do it.
It's been a hard year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to get my trust back.
It is a stand-alone effort, and I am glad that I can help," said one feeling lady Garcia after the European victory.
He then sends the case to his countryman John Ram, who fell down the American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 on a single day of Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud of having killed Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It's a spy statistics for one of the best golf players ever won 14 great titles, just by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had all weekend problems with finding the form with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American Captain, Jim Furyk, said after his exhilarating revelation: "I am proud of the Goods, because they fought for the cause.
There was still time in the morning when we gave Europe a fight.
We lost.
The hate for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
We want to regroup, and I want to work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and then we'll go on.
I love the 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You've got to make it easy on your hat.
We were defeated."
