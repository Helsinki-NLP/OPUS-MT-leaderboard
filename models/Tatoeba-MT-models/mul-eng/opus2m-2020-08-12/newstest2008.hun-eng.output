European inflation has been cut down in food
The rapid inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rise in food prices.
The price increase in the eurozone was higher than expected in 13 countries, with an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent after the 2.6 per cent of October was recorded - it was reported by the Union statistical office of Luxembourg.
The official statement only confirmed 3 percent - announced Bloomberg.
Unlike the United States, the United Kingdom and the Canadian banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not want to be based on the fact that the reduction would lead to the creation of inflationary spirals along with rising gains and declining unemployment.
The ECB is under two hundred, but it would like to keep the inflation rate close to this.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in its mid-term chapter: "You have to talk about" inflation so that you do not have to act on this subject any longer.
In Germany, the rate of November inflation is 3.3 percent for twelve years; in Spain, it grew from 3.6 to 4.1.
The euro area inflation has been reduced by rising food and energy prices.
The ceiling notes have increased by 88 percent, and the price of the spoken word has been at the highest since 1973.
Similarly, there was a need to pay more in 2007.
The global price of oil has increased by 52 percent this year, and in the past month, it has already grown to nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation has decreased from 2.1 per cent in 2008 to 2.5 per cent in 2008 but has already decreased to 1.9 in 2009.
It is estimated that the 12-month inflation rate will be around 3% in the next 3-4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, it is expected that the ECB has reduced the deficit twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
After a long stay of support, Fides has been significantly increased since December, so since 2002, there has been the largest camp, while Gallup has not yet measured the 13 percent socialist support.
On certain electoral parties, the difference - due to the greater disparity of opposition voters - would mean more than two-thirds (71 percent) support against MSZP's single (20 percent) support.
According to the MDF and SZDSZ, there are two per cent of the total population's support.
There are more than one hundred supporters of both teams among the safe voters.
The economic situation was further distorted by the past half-point - it was never so high, 41 percent of those who were judged to be very poor in terms of the country's economic situation, while another 46 percent felt that the situation was likely to be bad.
The families are now being judged again in pessimism after the more promising exhibitions of the Tavas and the harvest.
For the next year, the population's largest population has increased its volume and only ten improvements.
In December more than ever before, 71 percent of the respondents felt that the Prime Minister was worse than the Minister is doing his job well.
In Gyurcán Ferenc, 13 percent of the respondents are confident or very confident, while 38 percent of the supporters are from Orbán Victoria.
At least 54 percent of the head of government do not believe in it, 27 percent in the President of Fides.
One indicator of the political situation is that society is part of society that it can deal with the Minister's dissatisfaction without a change of government.
As long as 35 percent of the general October strikes have been expected to remain the government and the head of government, this rate is currently only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) is only the solution at the time of the new elections.
It is of interest to the referendum that 60 percent of the respondents answer to the question of extending the vote to be sure to leave and another 20 percent say that they would probably leave.
As a comparison, only 55 percent would be involved in a "probably scheduled national election" on Friday, and another 15 percent would be likely to be involved. The result of the vote would not be a question on the basis of the current deadlines.
74 people for their studies, 79 for their visits, and 84 percent for the hospital's daily visits.
If we look at the same rates in the referendum only as promised participants, 81, 84 and 89 percent of the voters would end up with the introduction of priests, visitors and hospital days.
The most precious of the Auchan, about five feet from Tesco.
Three times in the Bulgarian trade, the hypermarkets held an average price increase of 16 percent, in contrast with the fact that the price did not increase.
Article of the Economic Area
This year the average of 16 percent increased in the Bulgarian trade for the traditional Christmas season, but in each hypermarket, more than a thousand forums have been shown to increase in value.
Since prices in food stores have already been "cut off" in December, so there has been no dramatic attraction for the previous high base for hundreds of years.
But it is obvious to consumers that what they could get under nine thousand dollars a day is now not even worth ten thousand dollars.
For the Day, at least 91 feedstocks in the studied hypermarkets exceeded the 10-hour feed limit.
The highest price was 10,573 dollars.
(In 2003 the price fell to 6800 fort.)
The price of Unicum and the living fish is about to fall to the ground level, but it's very attractive to the pukyamella, the dio and mace.
KSH's data was followed by the price of the list and chain in the business, and we may have found a kilogram of chain in Auchan for 139 miles.
The competition did not lower the product price by 200 fort.
At the same time, it was surprising that the double-responsible price of Coco-Cola was below 200 forts, so only 257 forts were requested for the product.
With this, however, Auchan showed up at the Dapi Square to the most expensive, while Cora was the most prestigious.
It is estimated that the common Christmas prices are based on Cora 15, while Tesco and Auchan have increased prices in the daily range by about 18-18 percent.
In combination with the highest domestic cost and the highest time prices, the difference was 12 percent, while the highest domestic average and the highest time cost was 21 percent increase.
There was an average growth of 1480 in Forint.
Tavaly the average price rose to 1206 in the morning, so she felt the effect on the prices on the past Christmas season.
In fact, this process has led to trade, which appears to have been unable to prevent shops from using prices for a product, which would have the same effect on consumption.
(If a product's marketing speed is wrong for the trader, it will make a serious use of butter at the price adjusted for marketing.)
As a result of the hunger, the increase in the price of the Napi basket was so high that the most expensive 1720 fort was higher than the 2006 value, while the lowest was 844 fort.
In this case, this quality did not show up, since the most expensive 1630 fort was more than usual and the most expensive 1284 fort.
In addition to the two Christmas season seasons, catastrophic price increases were shown to be more than 30 percent higher in the hypermarkets.
(In other words, KSH data are not necessarily accurate: a higher price than 30 per cent over 12 months for some basic foodstuffs by the statistical office.
For example, next to the list is also on the list.)
According to the Daily report, this appears to be almost impossible, since the average price of the product is already as expensive as the basis for a price increase of up to 10 percent in the worst case.
According to the figures, consumers are in a stronger position than the bidders, the dramatic increase in prices has also been achieved in many.
The hippies don't complain, they keep counting for a year.
According to our experience, prices are no longer of interest to buyers in the above three companies.
They buy lots from everything, they carry sustainable food on board.
Before noon, all three shopping houses had serious cuts in front of the money because the number of visitors had suddenly increased.
But we know that in rural areas, more and more companies are complaining that their income will remain from their plans, and not only food but sustainable consumption.
In many places they're spooked on infected equipment.
More than a thousand infections have been registered in hospitals, which are mainly due to the inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The conditions of hospital hygiene, the severity of bed rest, the overcapacity of the staff do not favour the prevention of infections, is established by the National Centre for Epidemiology.
There's a lot of places where they're spooked up with infected equipment.
Recently MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatological class of the Janos Hospital.
In a man who was infected after a serious accident, he was shown antibacterial resistance to antibiotics.
The patient was separated.
A similar infection occurred early in the year.
A serious car accident was allowed home from the hospital, but it was not too late to return with MRSA infection, and since then it had not been able to perform an important operation because of the bacteria in its organization.
In this year the hospital infection caused by multi-resistant cancers was reported to the National Nosocomial Survey System, said Börcz Karolina, head of the National Centre for Epidemiological Epidemiology.
This means that the infection caused by these multi-resistant cancers has certainly been registered in hospitals, not knowing about others.
About two thirds of the infections (683 infections) were MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin resistance caused Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium is excreted in the urine without any human intervention to cause the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. torturing, mandating, skin infection, infection) respond well to antibiotics and may be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are used in excess of or not appropriately, a highly resistant bacteria from a well-responsive bacteria to antibiotics is developed, which quickly spreads between inadequate hospital conditions.
In most cases, severe infections of the immune system may occur in patients with moderate or moderate hepatic impairment such as infection or haemorrhage.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be combined with the guinea pig, MRSA just doesn't exist there, said Nyulasi Tibor, where they don't study the presence of the disease.
Antibiotics
"We distinguish such patients, see them in rubber and masks, and have appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," said Nyulasi Tibor.
Patients who are admitted to the hospital are tested to see if MRSA is present in their organisations, but it is not always possible to get infection.
It's not weird about the modeling.
Most of the hospital infections caused by MRSA could be preventable, however, the current home hospital conditions and conditions are not conducive to preventing the development and spread of multi-resistant patients, says Börcz Karolina.
After this infection occurs in hospitals, in nursing homes, hospitals should be monitored for infected patients and patients receiving MRSA should be immediately separated.
However, in Hungarian hospitals there are no microbiological samples in the theatre.
This also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these studies.
In most cases, if there is an detectable MIRSA infection, the head doctor of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine and home directives for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
The objective of antibiotics therapy should be to conduct microbiological studies to prevent resistance to medicinal products, but hospitals do not take this into account in all cases.
The microbiological samples are even more rare in the diagnosis of erythema, or baseline, as reported by Böröcz Karolina.
Stainless steel
Scientific evidence proves that MRSA is one of the most common diseases of the world by means of health personnel.
Therefore, handwashing, pancreas, massage use is very important, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals.
However, there is not always an opportunity to distinguish the infected patient from the affected patient among the hospital conditions of the MRSA.
In fact, courts have often collapsed, often very close to each other, and patients should be at least 1.5 metres away from each other from the side of the hospital.
Unfortunately, experience has also shown Börcz Karolina that in hospitals in poor material conditions, there are fewer infections, fewer patients, and even more likely to develop infections.
According to Böröcz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are taken, there may be less infection, or the spread of the disease may be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection causes serious expenses to healthcare providers and therefore they fight against everything.
In England, for example, the government programme included a reduction in the prevention or prevention of MSA.
According to the signs, the program is successful, based on public data, showing reduced trends in MRSA infections in England.
The priorities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) include the prevention of multi-resistant cancers (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by such diseases.
There was no part of the police chief responsible for the deadly accident.
The official expert opinion was drawn up in the case of a fatal accident caused by the Chief of Police of District XXII.
It may be concluded that the 21st district chief of police, who was present at the time of his post, who was killed by a lawyer, informed Morva Attila of his decision on Friday after having prepared an expert opinion on this matter.
The expert opinion supported the initial investigation result which already established that the former chief of police had not consumed alcohol before he had sat behind the wheel.
The leader of the 21st district capital, Akori, and his own passenger car in the 21st district of Kossuth Lajos, took two 55-year-old men who did not want to cross the road to the designated place.
(The latter, because the criminal has not crossed the line, according to the rules of the KRISZ, it is also necessary to give priority to the car driver.)
He lost his life after being transferred to the hospital.
Because of the incident, the local police chief asked for his post and asked him to be placed in a state of rest, according to the police report, because the case was so complicated.
In the case, an investigation is being carried out by the Budapest Anti-Fraud Agency.
Morvai Attila also pointed out that the former chief of police had been working with the investigation proceedings since the beginning.
More than EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Three, a total of EUR 400 million, education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as a loan agreement supporting energy, signed by Veres János Finance Minister and Marta Gajecka, President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) in Budapest on Friday.
In 2006 the European Development Bank (EIB) approved a 300 million euro framework for financing transport and environmental protection projects from cohesion support, from which 100 million credit contracts have already been concluded by the parties, and the current signed contract on the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
Education-related projects also provide budgetary funding to the EUR 150 million credit agreement.
The EIB has all left EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, the use of the remaining EUR 150 million later, can be achieved by the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, EUR 50 million have been signed by the countries which are primarily used for the Debrecen Community research development project.
The conversation also took place at the 4th meter.
In this context, it was agreed that when Hungary completes its details of the financing of the metro with the EU, it will return to whether or not the original contract should be amended.
This, according to Veres János, can take place in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has financed 113 projects with EUR 8.4 billion since 1990 in Hungary.
Credits are paid to EURIBOR, 8 years of long-term and non-permanent credit obligations to the EIB.
Bulgaria EU property paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is bumulative - the whole of Europe's attention to the previously mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who buy the EU's most expensive but quickly expensive market?
Analysis of Re/Max Bulgarian Division.
The most affordable Eastern European property purchase goal is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, its cheap apartments and coastal houses.
Among the most beautiful areas of the mountains are Banszko, Borovec, Pamproo and Vitosa, and Albena, Aranypart, Napospart, the ancient Szopol and Nessebar, but are still looking for more property in Kavarna and the Baltic.
According to the analysis by Re/Max Bulgaria, the central part of the country will also raise the interest of investors - so Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and they will also buy more and more in the light Russian environment.
The main city, Sofia level, has the opportunity to slow down, trade and office services promise the highest level of distribution.
Bulgaria is on its best way to become one of the most prosperous European golf paradises, so that it will be a great road goal for the next two years along the summer and the winter season.
For this reason, forward-looking investors are already buying large quantities in the Banszko district.
Analysts say that buyers who do not own in Bulgaria live their lives on the same path, and they also need to change our way of life.
Most buyers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more from Romania.
The capital and Cypriot investors are also present, and many Russians are traditionally involved in the Black Sea and the Siparades.
Foreign buyers can be grouped into three groups - says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Stocks or leases are purchased at between EUR 50 and EUR 100 thousand, or old houses destroyed for EUR 5-15 thousand, then sold.
It requires good proximity and communication opportunities, important to us as a city, business and generally the local doctor's approach.
The second category is the holiday purchaser (Bulgaria was listed as the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is made up of business-oriented investors who purchase in the hope of medium- or long-term increase.
The attractiveness of capital property is ongoing, as the search is becoming more and more intense.
In the European Union, the poorest in Bulgaria are the poor, but they have grown by 21 percent over the past five years.
On the basis of the increase in real estate, the rate of payments exceeds the rate of payment.
Fodor and the six hundred Magyar
Fodor Gábor informed the Minister for Environment and Water that the experts will be finalised on Monday, and after the official opening of the Ministerial Conference, the International Climate Change negotiations will continue to be held after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which provides for efforts to reduce emissions from the Kyoto Protocol to 2012.
At present there is a heated debate between developed and developed countries.
The United States also noted that it does not currently want to discuss accurate figures, although it is in line with the agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020 compared with the 1990s.
The Conference is another major question whether developed countries are undertaking, in addition to reducing emissions, to provide both material and technological assistance to developing countries.
There was also an agreement on aid to developing countries.
The support base, on which the Kyoto Protocol is based, will be headed by 16 members of the Governing Council, expected to be read within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) in the market and profit.
Six percent of Hungary
Fodor Gábor, Minister of Environment and Water for Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to preserve its role in global climate protection efforts and to promote the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is responsible for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by the 1990s by 2020, regardless of the success of the "after 2012 agreement" and is ready to take up even 30 per cent if the world's other major developed areas, as well as developing countries, are willing to assume their responsibilities and abilities.
Fodor Gábor pointed out that in 1997, in all countries which are party to the Kyoto Protocol, 5.2 percent of the target was to reduce, including the EU - then 15 more Member States - to a minimum of 8 percent.
The 6% greenhouse gas emission assessment of Hungary's obligation is for the period between 1985 and 1987 which will be carried out by our home. - recalled the Department of Environmental Protection's press release.
In this case, Balin would not follow a new international emission reduction system, as it would be necessary for the IPCC, the International Nobel Prize for Climate Change, the International Science Agency for Climate Change, in its most recent report under the Kyoto Protocol.
This reduction in emissions would cause delays and would prevent an increase in earth average growth of 2 Celsius, which, according to scientists, would result in extremely severe and irreversible consequences.
On YouTube, the British army is fighting.
It publishes recordings of Iraqi and Afghan actions by British military units that make themselves popular with them.
For the first time, British Air Force (RAF) received YouTube: the BBC reported on its actions against the Taliban since March 2006.
These are controlled by a small and expensive camera on the Canary Air Operation Command, and then sent to London, where their homes are placed on the Internet.
Impartial political message
More than 75 of the air forces have already entered 139 in such a form on the Internet, and they've looked at their "crowds" in more than 75 ways.
The British Ministry of Defence "defenceheadquarters" was registered in March 2007 and all Iraqis, all of them, publish videos about Afghanistan's actions, while the British Ministry of the Community (Commonwealth Office) and the Iraqi International Peacekeepers (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Entry into Afghanistan
According to the original purpose of the air, he set the videos for fire, and according to the Ministry of Defence, it is also good to inform the general community of the actual objective of the presence of the foreign forces.
The propaganda published in this form does not go to any level in terms of traditional, television-television-tolerance advertising - told BBC defence expert Gordon Mackenzie - but it does not necessarily carry any political message, as it is in its own form to justify the existence of military actions rejected by the government.
The Americans made a game
The army is also concerned that, in addition to carefully designed, focused recordings, amateur videos are also released on the partner who, for example, show the death of the soldiers: the little figure in the "official" propaganda films is the same as the purest of the losses, but they do not show the blood side of the war.
A number of videos have already been posted on the Internet from Iraqi and Afghanistan, but the British army has only recently received live inputs.
The Americans fight a little bit differently, the free American's Army with a shooting game, which can also fit into the soldiers' skin under a smaller-than-life simulation.
The ministry will be a hot and boiling Christmas
The Minister of Labour of Lamperth Monika does not seem to be sensitive: instead of a Christmas party, he holds an annual job interview for his employees who can thank him for his bread and coffee since 2007.
You'll find a ministry where you'll have a live party, where you'll have a car and a car. You'll have a Christmas song in the hearts of the officials.
Buli, Christmas songs, concerts and svets - that's what power is.
They're ready for Christmas too.
The largest regular Ministry's Christmas party is held by the defence court, but the HM is not expected by the Ministry's employees.
At the Rárvák Christmas, the children of the dead soldiers receive a gift, the families of the soldiers serving in the current foreign missions are hosted by the Mission, but they also arrange for the release.
It's only 25 million dollars a year's worth of cash.
The National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economic and Social Affairs (GKM) are responsible for other matters.
The GKM party is held in the Future House, a total of 4,320,000 forts, and a total of three hundred guests are expected from the six hundred ministry workers.
They're going to get stuck in the Christmas season, but they're going to have to have fun and tortillas.
The United Nations Christmas season was 4,700,000, and there were concerts and dinners held at the National Court of Justice (OIT) building.
The earthquake hit a million forts, more than four hundred guests spent the rest of the night.
We know that one of the classes of the NFU is also official for another Christmas celebration: this is a candidate company, organized by the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development from the EU.
For this purpose, the building of the House of the Dead Sea was built.
The information on the MAG Zrt has not been confirmed because we have not been able to reach the mission.
You don't have to wear a suit.
The OIT building not only visited the NFU but also the Ministry of Justice and Management, which was held on 7 December instead of Christmas Eve.
They didn't ask for money for the use of OIT terms.
Five hundred people took part in the ball.
The party started with the Minister's thanks, and he could dance before dinner.
The question [origo] was raised: the ball was not necessarily the night dress or dress.
The Puritan party is organised by the Health, Labour and Self-Government Board.
The Ministry of Health organises workshops and holidays in its own building for 400 000 employees.
However, the Minister of Labour, Lampert Monika, is not officially looking forward to the Christmas party, but is looking forward to the end of the year.
Hundreds of visitors are expected to receive only coffee and cheese from the press, so the party is drawn out of 350,000 forts.
However, Bajani Gordon's self-government minister is simply going to be driving with his employees under the Ministry of State and Rural Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) owns a large company of 436 employees.
As a foreigner, 2500 forints are served at the Christmas party - in total a Swedish reception and a coaching man.
As soon as Veres János is Minister, the PM workers are celebrating Christmas every year.
However, it will not be a Bullihangull, it will not only be the Minister's speech but also strengthens the day-to-day.
On 20 January, the field inspection will be renewed, and the Ministry will be delighted.
The reception is held in the Vajdahunyadvár, Városlige, and according to the report of the panel, 1,000 for the one hundred guests are present.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple position, for which only foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary are official.
These agreements start with the short Minister of Finance every year and end with a renewed appreciation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture did not hold a Christmas party at all - they shared it with [origo] in the relevant media.
They couldn't say the price of the official Christmas season of the Environmental Protection Council on the press.
More than four hundred principals were invited to the party held at the Museum of Art.
The strengths of the giant strikes one another
On Friday they shall establish the strata-coordinating committees of the League of Trade Organizations and the National Association of Workers.
A large assembly is held on Saturday, on Monday, on the day of the closing vote of the Health Insurance Act, and the trial begins.
The action will certainly cause significant damage to transport, as road transport will be completely stopped and will be shot at by the BKV for up to 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League of Trade Organisations will know the details of the weekly strike organised jointly with the National Association of Workers.
The LIGA-MOSZ Branch Committee will also be established, which will coordinate the weekly actions.
They hold a large assembly in Zimbabwe, and from a week to a week, the strata-related organisations will continue their work indefinitely if they are unable to reach agreement with the government.
This means that they did not mark the date of the end of the strikes on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If the National Assembly has not yet adopted the Health Insurance Act, the authorities shall immediately withdraw the strike call.
However, if they vote on the law, then the strikes committees shall meet and decide on the continuation.
On the basis of the National Assembly's weekly agenda, it is also possible to imagine that they will vote only in late evening, perhaps at night.
A significant contribution can be made to transport due to the strikes started on Monday: work on the road will be suspended for an indefinite time, a part of Budapest's mass transport can take place before the end of the day, more than half of the Volan states.
At the same time, there will be a number of points of concern in the country.
Several professional organisations and civil organisations have joined in calling the strike, which are constantly updated in the Union.
Some organisations have identified strikes for an indefinite time, others for temporary retirement.
Until the afternoon, I was unable to stop by the Free Labour Organisation (VDSZZZ) from providing enough services, and the Christmas holidays are getting closer.
According to business reports, between 7 and 9 o'clock in the morning in the BKV, Budapest Airport, 4 o'clock in the morning, LIGA Villamos and Hehé Energia industry, 2 or 8 o'clock in the working hours of the Pedagogues and the Pedagogues in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors has a second warning strategy for the SZEF-based Health and Social Sector (EDDSZ) in the country, with a change of time.
The most important four requirements adopted by the League are that the government should re-examine the prevention of health insurance reform and forgive a new concept for social debate.
The second requirement is to gradually introduce a new method of calculation that has taken place since the coming year.
Thirdly, the high-level pension will also provide for the possibility of entry into the system by 2010.
The fourth reason is that the Ministry of Economic and Social Affairs does not accept a proposal from the Free Trade Organisation (VDSZZ) of the Free Trade Organisation of the League of Trade Organisations, which is waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital: Magyar Garda exposed the country's risk
With the support of the Magyar Gárda campaign for Hungary in August of this year, Hungary has also increased its political risk to Hungary and the region according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital.
The company's "risk alert" stated that, in connection with the Hungarian Guard's activities, it is at the highest political risk that "even if there are strong ethnic tensions between the Hungarian cigarette and non-cygian population, there can be a short distance between the existing ethnic differences".
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's policy strategy, which may have been aimed at promoting such an action, has been joined by the research agency.
As it has been written, all Hungarian political actors can be led back to one of the most important failures: "The public debate of the Roma has been made public by representatives of radical and noble political groups who could build a policy strategy against smoking".
This deepens the problem, makes it impossible to engage in normal conversation, strengthens virtues, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, according to the research institution, the activity of Magyar Gárda for the impact of major domestic and international media surveillance "has significantly affected the image from abroad, mainly with regard to the stability of the country and the belief in democratic development".
It was recalled that since the autumn of 2006, Hungary's radical and well-being groups have been becoming part of the reorganisation of its radical and welfare groups, which have been becoming part of Hungary's so-called "national self-defence" association since 2007.
"The joint appeal of these massacres to define themselves as civil organisations while their members openly declare themselves - whether they are armed - to protect their defence (catastrophobic, defence and defence) responsibilities, to be dealt with by the police, the army, or the State's use of force."
It was pointed out that all of this is in line with the method which requires different political measures based on the political and social neutrality of society to be made easy for civilians.
The emphasis on civility and the uniformity of the form is therefore not only due to the denial of legal barriers to judicial registration, but also to the political strategy.
According to the study, the risk factors of the activity of Magyar Gárda are also related to the relationship.
"In recent months there have also been potential threats in several neighbouring countries to the Magyar Gardá, and the political actors of some neighbouring countries want to correct their own Hungarian anti-political policies by referring to the surrender of Magyar Gárda.
Everything can be of political stability in the region," they added.
According to the research institution, the development of Magyar Gárda is not a unique feature in Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased across the region.
As noted, for example, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced by the Bulgarian National Guard (BNU) in August 2007.
Following the slaughter of the Bulgarian Guard, there are numerous Roman riots that occurred in one fourth of Sofia (Krassa Poljana).
The BNU decided to use this to build a storage facility, saying that the organisation aims at "national protection".
In the last 17 years we have seen a "cigany terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained silent and public - a reminder of the Political Capital.
It was added: the debate on the initiative has been changed to the Bulgarian public.
As it has been written, there is an increase in the risk of ethnic harmony that certain Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced that opposition will create their own burden.
Since the Hungarian Guard’s educational activities are similar to the Bulgarian National Guard’s operation, it is not surprising that the Hungarian Roma are responding similarly to the threat of their own self-defence - can be read in the Political Capital Risk Notice.
Juhaš Attila, director of the Political Capital Research Office, said that the risk assessment is one of the activities of the research agency.
As he said, they will issue their risk assessment annually and if they experience an impact on the risk change, they will inform the opinion as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Not everywhere is the red letter of the holiday
In Hungary the law is precisely marked by the red days and has become a general practice around the holidays, which will be less than in the future.
In the EU and America, the holiday is not the same.
The Hungarian legal system varies national and state holidays and workdays.
The working days are often due to church holidays, marked historical events.
We are also celebrating its new year: last week and the first day of the new day - the last one just because the fishermen can leave themselves.
Every year, we've got a total of ten red letters.
On March 15 and October 23, 1848, the national anniversary of the 1848 revolution, also the 1956 Revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate our work on May 1, and on November 1 and 2, we remember our missing companions, our friends.
In addition, we have two days to celebrate the flesh, the silver and the Christmas.
Since our public, national or local religious holidays are rare at the end of the week according to the calendar, the workplace has become a practice in cases where we work only one day before or after the red holidays.
Yes, the price of longer weeks is that we don't stay in previous rooms away from work school.
That the day before or after the holiday must be worked, the Minister of Labour shall regulate a specific regulation for years.
The law extends it to all workers and workers employed by them, to their employees and to those in the public service area.
However, it does not affect the companies, institutions, service providers operating on working days without interruption.
This year, only about the end of the year has changed the work schedule: from 24 December, life will be in the country, as most people have been using the days between Christmas and Easter, or for this purpose, they use their time-limited freedom.
In the future, we will celebrate more holidays around the week or at the end of the week, so there will be less workday stays than this one.
First of all, it's about the day's work, and then it's about four days' lunch at home.
On Saturday, 26 April, it will be on Saturday, May 2, on Friday.
The other move will be on the 23rd of October: on 18 October, Saturday will work on Friday instead of Friday 24th.
However, the end of the year may not last for the future of the holiday, as it holds a nonstop drop from December 24, even if it is on the silvester's computer.
Six drawbacks you can get your colleagues together with
E-mails that we forget to send, voicemails that we never get, harmless lies that we don't notice at all: they're "show" every day at work.
It is a question of whether you will be affected by the shortness of breath or take the cupboard, and you will be aware of the circumstances that are likely to cause anxiety for others.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to say I was looking for a marketing class," says one of your colleagues.
How did you stay from a meeting?
In the best case you're sorry and try to do the right thing, maybe call the marketing department to tell you you forgot to send the message (this is the least common solution).
Most of the time, it's about an apology.
It would be good to think about what you can get to your colleagues for a while before you get into a painful trial, and be aware of how to avoid it.
Do you borrow something that's not yours?
There's no more impressive gift when you're begging for a letter, an office or your phone, and there's no place to go.
Remember that you put your fire machine on the table yesterday, but it broke out in the morning?
Maybe you'll find any of your colleagues at the office of the deceased?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking, 'cause they'll be just mad at you to promise you property.
Don't get upset with your office boots, your mail, because it may be inappropriate if it takes time, and you'll need it right away.
You're kidding my colleagues' lives?
There's no good way to stop the spread plate.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don't blame your colleagues for your feelings (conditions) on your own.
If one of them shares most secrets with you, don't come back with confidence.
Put your ears in your mouth, and don't talk to your workmates in the distance, even if others know what your partner is doing.
Do you mean the indocolonian?
When you call the office and report a patient referring to the head of the nurse, because your public feeling is bad or that you feel better that day; think that your work, your work, your non-fishing tasks, must be done for someone else.
Don't fuck with your colleagues.
If you know ahead of time that you're not going to get into the office next day or something you need to stay home for, mark your colleagues and your boss don't miss you another day.
Dizziness, irritation, telephone
You're a man at work, but you're gonna be so hard on your colleagues' anger?
Did you ever want to be a latecomer for a phone call that wouldn't have been better to hear?
Do not disturb your work with noise, singing, loud talk (which you keep up your head), nor with football, continuous injury, loud discomfort.
All of these may be disturbing, even if they are not directly involved in a project (in writing, planning, organisation).
Do you blame others for your mistakes?
If there's no time, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, don't worry about your absence.
Don't refer to a potential intruder in the office, your voice fellow.
You know, if you've made a mistake, you've got someone else's back on it, and you've got your ass kicked out.
Ask me how you can make your mistake, break the spell.
Are you feeling too much at home at the office?
Mackonadare and papa: easy ride home, but it's not going to the office!
Then don't take a comfortable vacation dress if you're allowed to work.
Don't be shy, your colleagues, and respect yourself by wearing a weekend dress - if you're doing your job, you're pretty, you're getting into the office!
If you want to answer, you're not interested anymore
Car rental in the usual morning dormitory.
A special tone is raised from the radio: a loud sound that is accompanied by electronic effects.
I'll make the sound better.
The music has become a timer and the old sound comes to the side of the bassus, then connects the female's skin as a real instrument.
The number of Zagar Wings of Love is on mr2.
The music of home life has not yet made us feel better with a good quality electronic poppy.
But now it looks like it's all different if you're listening to the new Zagar.
Yonderboi's appearance, some new and exciting production from the home's digital base has gradually changed in the picture, and there's a lack of a flowering garage rock again, the home electropop also proves: it's new under the Day.
Zzezer Balázs started from Pécs, and you played in Yonderboi’s music, until - perhaps because two doubts did not lead him into a heart attack.
With its project (Zagar) and its music, which is the jazz, electronic dance, five pop elements, but it started breaking up when movie soundtracks were asked to compose (e.g.
Turök Ferenc Szezon).
At the beginning of the smaller clubs, it became known to the public when the first albums in the van2 magazine of 2002 were placed among the five most important domestic albums, and it called Zagar, Yonderboi's company, the only, and the most successful domestic trends.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his music became "trend," but of course no one asked them if they were willing to take the note.
The musician reacted as he should: he made a new, better album.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open up new roads for us even though you want to create the title with the first five years.
This is the same Zzoser Balázs as an old singer.
We were in a position of air and flight, but in addition to the air quality of music now appeared - according to the trend of the old mind, the more sound guitar, the rock and roll effect.
In these events, at the famous Millennium Prize, the current song with The Puzzle Music in England, Ligetti György showed himself.
The album also produced a real radio striker, and since the next morning, mr2 Petófi, who has been playing popular music since now, has begun to tap into his ears with the six home song "Underground Divas" set by Wings of Love.
It is therefore all right (?).
Hvg.hu Zzoser Baláz asked.
hvg.hu: This new game now raises the question: how long have you been playing?
Zzóser Balázs: The definition of longevity does not mean too much to me.
I think there are two types of convenience boxes; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but military and honest.
So-called alternative, earth-based music can also be tapes, nothing can be prepared for sale, which makes them commercial.
But with a good pop can also be drawn from honest instruction.
Your adoptive attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the Hungarian and foreign public's opening of music?
Zs.B.: On the outside, mostly from us, there are larger traditions of ease.
It's not only the 12-hundred-year-old concerts, it's the older ones.
Much more attention is being paid to the changes in their environment, since they are also part of the curt culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how much do they listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course it feels good that they're getting more and more into our concerts.
But we never made music on the market.
We're looking for music, not for purpose, but for some reason they're born.
The role of the public can be felt at concerts where the effects are already at work, but this is only due to the changes in the moment.
However, I noticed that if you want to meet the public, you're no longer interested.
hvg.hu: How much are you planning to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's working, and he's more comfortable with his career than we are.
Zs.B.: We are not really going his way, regardless of how they sometimes try to explain it in our music.
We're more of a team of people who trust in the presence of other music and let it out.
Of course it was inevitable that our work was compared to Yonderboi's music, since more than one of his songs came out and we left another way.
hvg.hu: The Wings of Love is the first place on the top of the mr2 Petófi.
Many of these numbers were first heard the name Zagar.
Did you know that you opened up with the most popular style on a greener scale?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a pen, then we sold the pen.
This is about more than that.
We saw the end of the album, which we tried to solve by the time we left, the following songs and the most difficult subjects.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six girls?
Why exactly did they - what was the lead?
Zs.B.: The idea was to be a good-looking nurse.
Then it came to the idea that we should make this course up of our own home music show with a good sound list.
This is how the second choir was formed - Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judy Jay, Péterfy Bori, the Woody Artist [Neo], Németh Juci - which we then crossed into the name Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you design or build the girls?
Zs.B.: The number in the instrument version already existed for a long time, then when the lead material was assembled, we thought it should be something else for this number.
The deal moved me to talk about it.
That night I picked up the date that the girls later learned.
First and foremost, the whole thing came spontaneously.
I remember, it was very noticeable, but, of course, they had to join the Dives.
My voice wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: All the stairs, all the concerts seemed to be behind the girls.
There's no words (except Judy Jay's short words), they don't have their own roles, they're all singing together and they're not more than music, so the music doesn't just sing their songs.
They were back on the stage.
Is that fate?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were behind was due to technical problems.
But it's known that we wouldn't be able to share speech.
The number also tells us to forget a little bit about where he came from, where he keeps us, just let these certain sources of love bring us up.
I'd like others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one was most of the work?
Zs.B.: In fact, none of the music's performances were more difficult than the few.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I'm playing in a competition, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work for a long time, and then he stopped at all for a while like a football game.
hvg.hu: What's my favorite number of new songs for you?
Zs.B.: This always changes with the concert and "I've already released" the tape.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
The buyer's broker threatened billions of lives due to a feeling of low-intensity
It's an inexhaustible success.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French Societé Generale Bank, was named by Jerome Kerviel.
As a result of the same demand, he lost almost EUR 5 billion.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was not in a position to do so.
In contrast to the other banks, he recognized the American flag market crisis.
"It's a lack of mental ability," he called out from the police's reports.
However, according to the French Le Monde, Kerviel’s statement shows that EUR 1.6 billion from its business last year has been obtained.
The government is not just in America.
"I just wanted to find money for my bank," she says.
It's looking for half a billion euros in the US crisis right now.
The opportunity has already been promised by the beginning of the year.
In February news reported that there would be problems with low-problem or subprime characters offered to clients dealing with past losses.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe this and made a good deal of it.
Last year's profit reached EUR 1.6 billion.
"Even though I was looking for the first half billion dollars, I didn't know how to get in," Kerviel realized and added that he had nothing to do with it.
In his statement, he admitted that he had lied to him so that he wouldn't get out of it.
Her bosses were also able to overcome, even when Eurex was also interested in his business.
The risk was obtained
Did you want everything out?
Not anymore.
"I thought it was just the fact that I was looking for 1.6 billion to the bank to comfort them."
Where did he want to risk so much?
He's getting more and more at his position.
He has been working with the General Bank of the Society since 2000.
A year's payout has moved around $111,000.
Two years later he was a brokerage firm, and he became a self-employed broker in 2005 with $90 billion in payments.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never seek as much as others did.
"In 2005, I knew during my first conversation that they looked at me with a bad look.
My finality, my professional and personal development," Kerviel told the investigators.
Not long after he entered, the first big success came.
Thanks to Allianz's members, he sought half a billion euros for these shares during the London bombings.
And this led to the launch of the Lavina.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
"It's like the waitress," he said to the police.
But the bosses were probably aware of everything or more.
"While I was looking for money, my eyes were lost."
It's been a while since the beginning of the year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
One weekend she wanted to see him in the middle of January.
By the time he got to work on the weekend, he wasn't working in the bank anymore.
And the bank announced a few days later that it lost five billion euros.
And how did they get there?
Because of her freedom, she became a suspect.
"I only spent four days last year.
The broker who has no freedom, a broker who doesn't want anyone to look at his reports," Kerviel concluded.
It is possible to purchase 365 billion euros from the Czech Republic
The Czech Government's ministers have signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, from which the Czech Republic can receive EUR 14 billion (about EUR 365 billion) in the coming years.
The total amount available from the Czech Republic from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
In the regions, there are about 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes.
Chechnya companies can receive around 100 billion korunas from the Business and Innovation Programme.
Most money, 150 billion crowns, towards transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents 22 percent of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state base of the Transport Infrastructure, which will be managed in the future with 90.8 billion koruna.
The Business and Innovation Programme will help businesses and companies to achieve tools for innovation companies.
Companies should also have resources for introducing new technologies, industrial research, but also for introducing more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is among the least successful in achieving the EU's financial resources under the newly established countries.
The former President of Nicaragua has been sentenced to nine years in prison by the Court
During the nine-year prison term of the Nicaraguan Court of Justice, Arnold Alemán was the president of the country to which he was sentenced for the financial losses of $100 million (at least EUR 1.8 billion) in 2003.
Later, however, they were released from prison and living in a house guard near the capital.
The fact that the former leader of this Central American country between 1997 and 2002 is going back after the races, according to the AP Bureau, is not clear at first.
According to the President of the Court of Justice, Ileana Perez will then rely on his prison leadership to let Germany's sentence go home or go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court confirmed to Germany that he regularly sent government money to foreign companies in Panama.
These fictional companies and their accounts were indeed their clients and their closest supporters.
Some of these funds were then implemented on the basis of which it was based on the financing of the 2001 German election campaign.
We've been blessed with our budget
That's right.
They've accepted the state budget.
What's special about this budget?
This is a budget without the support of the majority of the coalitions, which was set up by this first government.
This year's time has passed with the support of social democracies, as Sobotka Minister and Czech Social Democrat Party have not been able to accept non-conformity.
No dramas have taken place since the vote, unlike a loud debate on the government's mistrust.
The House of Representatives has generally ignored this, although it is the most influential law.
It's a certain contradiction.
All governments start and end with some chapters and items of the budget, whether they like it or not.
The budget is a key element of policy, but the government and the opposition are closed after a powerful war.
It's more grateful in the press, so you get a lot more attention in the media.
Politicians are more interested in public than in empty numbers.
The Government's state budgets of the former Social Democrats were three shortcomings which were not able to solve the 2008 budget at the same time:
The first of these is a high proportion of the law of compulsory, non-trust expenditure, which not only includes pensions but also social benefits, which are generally "coalition" approved by the ČSSD and KSCHM silent "coalition" before the elections
The second is the result of the first lack of adequate management.
The third limit is the deficits of central funding, i.e. the deficits of urban and income budgets.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit of the public budget.
This is under public and public control.
The deficits in the budget of the cities and passengers of the time-consuming bombs.
In addition to the money from taxes, duties and bank loans, many citizens have been able to obtain money for other investments, which have often been granted exemptions from obligations which have been sold to their towns.
In recent years, these assets have been managed to break down energy and other distributions by mass sales of parts of the distribution sector which have been received from the state from privatisation.
Now they don't have such a source.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we shall determine that:
Our economy has been going through a growing phase like the rest of the world for a few years, with the Czech Social Democrat Party constantly approaching.
This was a unique opportunity for governments to manage the financing.
However, the country has been reduced to more and more debt.
Other countries with two exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have enjoyed much more and more well-being in the Czech Republic.
This is primarily a disgrace to the former governments.
We belong to countries that are at least at the global level at the risk of poverty.
There is therefore no need for, for example, for powerful social programmes that have unfortunately been totally oversized in recent years.
Although this has also succeeded in eliminating the share of unreasonably populist expenditure approved before the elections, even if it is not in the near future to set the deadline for retirement and pension reform, any policy that is in place in this country will actually end, and whoever governs it will be only official co-operation.
A little too much can be said to make the majority of the money spent by the ruling politicians generally rest and social benefits become mechanical dividends.
It is therefore not possible to reverse the time budget, but it can only stop the reduction of normal expenditure by entrustment expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion planned for 2008 would be completely offset if previous governments had not exhausted everything that could have been done in the past decade.
If we do not really want to become corrupt officials from the ruling politicians, we must be patient and we need peace to prepare for further reform laws, not too strong, but a coalition government that can give the state only what it can get from taxes and powers.
Only these will allow for the increased achievement of the balanced budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Central Banks of the United States of America, the European Central Bank and the United Kingdom, Switzerland and central banks of Canada have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
The money markets are going to be worth hundreds of billion dollars in cash.
In this case, the bank will pay the interest rates for which I'm willing to lend money.
For example, the U.S. Fed spends four billion dollars on your purse and makes more money available to the European and Swiss central bank.
Following the tenth attacks in September, the central banks of certain countries were first established in a coordinated process to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the biggest problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote his client Bernard Baumohl, from the Economic Outlook Group consultant.
"The co-ordinated share of central banks in the United States has reduced the likelihood of recession by around 65 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost six billion dollars in the United States primarily because of unpaid loans.
Analysts count on additional billions of losses.
"The central banks can actually believe what may happen if they have decided on such a procedure," said Kieran Davies, head of the U.N. Amro government.
It seems that the situation is really bad," she added.
The central banks are afraid that if your banks may find it difficult to join loans, they will give loans to their clients more expensive.
This would reduce the need and the potential consequences for global economic growth in the US economy.
The central banks then decided that they did not succeed in reducing LIBOR, the London Central Bank’s contribution to the bank’s financial contribution.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of borrowing money, despite the fact that the central banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain had sometimes reduced their losses in the past.
"This will have a similar effect as a further reduction," said the Reuters agency Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the approach of central banks contributes to the crisis because it does not address the underlying problem, the pollution of the American real estate market.
Klaus: The amazing debate on ecosystems
Global climate change threatens the most developing countries.
President Václav Klaus reiterated his opinion on the issue of global warming.
The International Conference on Climate Change, held by the United Nations, has thus been criticised.
The book "Ték" in Bécs, not the green planet, said that the ecologists were not convinced.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric and reality of government and civil organisations.
"The debate in the home is absolutely devoid of structure, it's just a match with words that are the key to the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of the letter of the Czech President, he stressed that it was very important for him, and that is why he was so committed to this issue.
He expressed his satisfaction that the book would also appear in German translation, because, as he said, "I'm often just meeting with my thoughts."
Therefore, the interested parties can now read their undisclosed opinion.
Klaus recalled that although it is not climate-critical, he believes that he has sufficient conditions for signing such a book.
Because he has also been experienced as a qualified academic in his statistics and administration.
At the end of the book, it was pointed out that climate change is constantly changing, i.e. its normal changes, and in the view of the increase in global warming, all scientists are not satisfied that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious, so they do not pose a risk, nor are the costs borne by the measures aimed at affecting climate development.
In addition, as a person with experience in the field of totalitarianism, it is considered unacceptable to refer unconfirmed opinions to others who feel that they are a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He once again explained to the people's questions that "the environment is not against reasonable protection, but against military environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and users."
Klaus has already discussed the same subject two months ago at the Hayek Institute in Becs.
600 of them were unable to withdraw their rights
Six hundred passengers delayed the deadline and was unable to break the old legislation which expires at the end of the year.
Today's is the last day when you can still ask for your wish that the authorities can set up the new legislation by the end of the year.
However, the ministry does not fear that hundreds of thousands of passengers will leave after their departure without valid legality.
According to the authorities, those who no longer want to lead the legislation were not in the first place disappointed.
While the entry constitutes a serious breach of interest in legal acts, the main civil authorities have dealt with questions concerning legal acts for which interest increased this week.
The mayor's office will be hosted by about 2000 clients on a day.
It's gonna take about half an hour to stand in line.
In Prague, about 140000 passengers have not broken the legislation.
The presentation of a new lawyer lasts for a few days.
However, the new legislation may also be required for a shorter period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver has to pay five hundred more crowns.
Vehicle drivers who are unable to comply with the mandatory legal requirement by the end of the year and who are illegally travelling are at risk of being punished from January.
The criminal must pay a maximum of two crowns.
However, the police may also arrange for the discharge.
In the case of an administrative discharge, the penalty shall be 2500 kroner.
On the basis of the information received from the city hall, it may also receive a court which is not traveling.
He can pay at least 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has previously stated officials to be in charge and at least one thousand crown sanctions are to be imposed.
According to the head of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, however, no one is threatened by more than a dozen courts.
The legislator believed that it was a law that people would either want to reject or not.
This is not a personal statement, which must be valid for all.
Those who don't want to drive anymore should tell you about the lawyer.
It's enough to take it or send it to the appropriate office without a proposal.
By the end of the year, the rights issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, vehicle drivers must also be increasingly affected by other type of legalising.
Those with publications from 1994 to 2000 can enjoy another three years.
The validity of the authorisations issued between 2001 and 2004 shall be suspended only in December 2013.
It is estimated that there are about 2.6 million more laws.
The court reduced the punishment of the investigators associated with Berdyccel
Josef Opava and Petr Könérir were police officers who were charged with bringing David Berdych to trial, sentenced to three and ten years in prison.
On this basis, the Supreme Court of Prague has decided its final effect, which has thus reduced the penalties for one or more of them by two years.
The investigation of the Prague Cervet crime department initially threatened 14 and 12 years in prison.
Today's decision can no longer be brought into force, only a review may be requested by the Supreme Court.
Although Berdychet is being questioned at the same level in this case, he is only waiting for the first sentence.
In other procedures, he has been subject to more than 16 years of imprisonment.
You can't take it anymore.
In January, the Supreme Court first found 19 people involved in robbery attacks, of which the Supreme Court is currently dealing with 16 cases.
The majority of the charges have been filed since the initiation of the investigation by suggesting that it is a speculative case.
According to the Central Czech Senate, the police members of the Berdyccele agreement were seen with information from police sources, covered certain arrests and helped the gang to avoid prosecution.
That's why the gang gave 30 percent of the robbery to Opavan and the Conners.
The arguments include the crimes committed by the gang between 1999 and 2001.
First of all, there are those who have been victims of many serious health violations but who have not been allowed to do so by law enforcement.
Because the police found illegal weapons, rifles, laser beams or machine guns during investigations.
According to the gang, it's worth more than a million crowns of robbery.
On one occasion, nine members of the tribunals had already been found guilty of other arrests by Berdych and many others.
The other members of the Berdych district also testify in other proceedings before the court, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The first round of negotiations has so far been avoided by Tomáš Putát and Maros Šulej, who are in pre-trial detention in the country where they are awaiting a final decision on the prosecution of the Czech Republic.
Number of children: 12 million
For the children born, the rights of the affected families, Igor Veleba, from the hospital in Trébic, will result in 12 million damages and court fees.
Mother's head is three million, fathers' two million and children's one million.
He's offering over 200,000 as a parent in the hospital.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondréj Goodál Veleba, did not agree on the basis of the proposal.
"We're back on track because it's too much," said Dostal after the discussion today.
"In order to start an opinion on the opposition, we need an expert opinion drawn up by the enemy.
We'll find out if there's any value to be used at all.
But we maintain our opinion that this will be possible for everyone in the hundreds," Dosto stressed.
It is believed that between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč should move between four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Japanese family wanted a million crowns every month until it called its own biological daughters.
Verebá has served as a professional judge on the basis of the damage negotiations, which was issued by the Prague Motol University College.
According to child psychologists and psychiatrist experts, the children suffered a variety of severe and profound mental pain and stress.
The stress situation was better handled by the men, even if they met with such a vendetta that they didn't stop their newborn.
Women worsen by updating the traffic and what's going on right now, it's stuck together with the contents.
Veronica and Nicole were killed by sisters born on December 9th.
Last week the children returned to their blood - Nikola Čermáké in Pribyslavice, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanov in Jablonov.
Vysočina's tour director, Miloš Vystrčil, handed over 100,000 koronas to the families at the end of October, which resulted from the mistake of the emergency hospital.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are subject to insurance under the law.
In the event of infringement, they shall be placed on the table of contents, except where they request the assistance of the Founder.
So far, the courts have allowed relatively low damage to people, some hundreds of millions, except for a few million koruna tables.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Valaisko
Bolek Polívka lost his initial pen for the title of the kingdom of Valaisko.
According to the Ostrava Journey Court, he used the name of some king for the first time, but the project worked with a team of Tomáš Harabiš who worked with the coloring team for many years.
Polivka didn't take part in the negotiations today.
According to the legal representative, however, the case is unlikely to end and the client will be more concerned.
"The debate is about Mr. Harabish and the Bolek Polivka people living in general," said Polivka's lawyer after the press.
He thinks under the words of the Valachi kingdom everyone is going to the dance comedy.
This opinion is shared by Harabish.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money research and stockpiling," she said.
I think life is money.
"Over the years they realized that the project was successful and they could win something.
They want to save us from our work," she did.
Intravenous business
According to the court, a king named Polivka used his name for the first time in a television series.
In 1993, Radoslav Brzobothý crowned him.
At the time, however, this did not depend on the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish made up his mind on the issue of certain rights.
The original study action was created as a business and future business activity, followed by the establishment of Harabish of the Kingdom of the Valaško.
By showing the name and signature of Polívka agreed in 1997 on the routes, including when visiting the farm and the cinemas offered by these owners.
Who's gonna hold the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabish used only the idea that Polivka used for the public business in the manifesto.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polivka has certainly helped the Valachi kingdom project," said the judge.
However, he added that the project was the spirit of Harabish and the team involved.
Cooperation between the already agreed parties continued until 2000 when Harabish Polivka was officially organised in Vsetín.
Since then, however, controversy has raged between Polivka and Harabish, who have been involved in the creation of "King Boleslav, chosen by all."
Jarmila Šulák took the lead in the kingdom to start Harabish as queen.
In 2002, Polivka Harabish and his associates filed a case-law against which the court had withdrawn today.
In the debate, Harabish could bring a fight for the throne and the queen.
This fight should be a new king.
He didn't want to stop the details and the date.
"We don't want to get anything.
This should be something like the Royalization of Slovakia.
The king should be chosen at a certain time.
Mr. Polivka can also be quietly reported," said Harabiš.
207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot test: missing requirements
Honestly, I never liked Peugeot 206.
There are no specific characteristics, the quality of change, the quality of management and the quality of production.
But the end of the market already exists, Peugeot 207 is essentially better.
And the so-called SW van goes on one step further, so I don't think it's better for me than I think.
When I tested Peugeot's 207 classic haschback, for example, I complained at the last sitting of the head left.
This time the complaint is over here, because the van's carousel means that in this regard the two-metre highs are no longer suffering.
Fürgen in the World
I'll be right through the inside so I don't repeat myself many times.
It's quite a successful design, where I'm the only one to get out of the poor console.
Here I would appreciate some more designer invention if the outside of the car was so elegant.
The meetings are comfortable, and where are they already when we complain about the short part of the meeting or the coffee?
The side leadership has also improved significantly in relation to the 206 model.
As far as the area is concerned, there can also be a sense of growth in carousel sizes.
After the match, the head is missing a small place mentioned.
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
This vehicle is the main reason why it's packaged.
I need to appreciate this very well accessible (and also thanks to the back-up frames) and heavy soil.
Empty spaces are equipped with containers that are ideal compromises.
There's no way, there's no way, there's no way, there's more difficult stuff going on.
But let's stay on the ground for a while.
On the basis of these tables, the basic arrangement 428 l, which has a higher average value for competition.
In the Czech Republic, however, it is not the most expensive type of vehicle - against Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to the new generation product of the young boeslav, then we'll determine that Peugeot is going to be well behind 52 litres.
This value is already critical for outdoor rest or childcare.
But if I have to remove the positives, then I still need to mention the level completely equal to the level after the second row accounts are closed or the very low threshold.
120 litres in four rows
Our tested vehicle was equipped with a 1.6 litres of 88 kW output with four sound, independent engine.
And in the right way, you should look at the hundreds of thousands of people who are wearing the family hatchback.
Calm down, little consumption and first-hand meat.
If we compare it to Scotland's compatriot, which is six times as many as it would have been thrown into its shell, I can only be happy about that.
Tell me the price.
The price of the car isn't cheap.
However, we need to remember that we have tested a car equipped with a very good inner surface and a very good motor.
He's still leaving for 329 900 Kč with four foreign motors.
The vehicle starts with 410 990 Kč, which is already quite large.
The tested Premium equipment will blow the equipment with another 80,000 Kč.
So we're still developing, our automatic climate, our automatic start-up, our rear-end electric circuit...
So the car goes to Kč 531 900 with the toll-vono.
It's a lot, but it's counting on Fabia's additional equipment, and it's very similar.
So you're not going to stay behind anything else than the next round of the mark.
The integration of Swedish students into British schools failed
In British schools there are increasingly Eastern European children who have become concerned about the further development of local schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is facing a number of obstacles.
British schools also recorded cases when disputes between immigrant and domestic children erupted.
The problems related to the integration of Eastern European children are well illustrated by an incident in a North-West village where there is a growing debate between local and Slovak immigrants.
The relationship between the students and the bond between parents is already a sign of parental attitudes.
Until then, the situation was known as being that in Chatham, the police took a woman who had a ten-year study in Slovene.
The crime is protecting him from being hurt by the son of a racist spy.
The police had to take action after two twelve-year-old girls were attacked by a Slovak immigrant.
The girls are standing by the man with racist remarks and punched him in the back.
"When we were at home, a boy walked up to the bus stop and started to pick us up.
When I told her that she would stop this with her hands and her neck on us, she would find out her mindless back," the mother of the students of the Slovenes wrote down the most unpleasant case for The Times.
Both sides have complaints.
One of the local residents has praised the debate on Eastern European immigrants for the battle of survival.
The above - mentioned cases suggest that in British schools, there is a gap between locals and immigrants.
In Great Britain, there are obviously 70 thousand job seekers.
About 30 thousand English students attend British schools.
Cuba's highest peak in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's actually the height of freedom.
Whatever you're waiting for, it can be fulfilled if you choose the right way.
The golden and white parks, high valleys or sea, calm like a fish.
Palmafás and all including pizzerias offering pizza, pasta or pasta cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roll.
You can find this on the Caribbean Sea in a more comprehensive and more economical list.
However, there is much more to be found on a lake, and this is Cuba, the largest and largest lake in the Great Antilla.
Under Spanish, Cuba was the capital of the U.S. invasion.
Columbus named it the most beautiful place he's ever seen in human eyes.
He became a trader and a fighter who had been kidnapped by the Spaniards in America and transported to Europe.
It's gonna be the American season.
The National Hotel was built at the end of the 20th century.
Lucky Luciano, an American mafia chief, built because everything that was counted as a crime in the United States (mainly rape), welcomed in Cuba and supported drugs, happiness, prostitution.
For example, they were among foreigners
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In the morning, tower houses were built, and cars were transported in large cities as a cultural symbol of the past 50 years.
Ernest Hemingway bought a ticket in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and he had his own hunt in Cojímar.
The Bodeguita del Medio leaves the signatures of American business stars and politicians.
And today?
You can see the view on Monday's Bodeguita.
The expensive National Hotel is your favorite cooker.
And in the 1950s, cars are now transporting cars in Havana because the once-exported juicy and young people have long been trapped in this cold and cold air.
Although the oldest part of Havanna was first destroyed significantly, however, there is not as beautiful colonial memory elsewhere as it is right there.
Other places are still worse than Trinidad.
In view of the fact that foreign trade provides the necessary money, its development has received a green path.
In the last ten years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana but also in Varader, on the part of Holguín County and on such islands as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another unique advantage in the world, which is primarily appreciated by stakeholders.
From their extensive meetings, your sugarcane was transported to the sugarcanes by gas and motorbike.
Car parks have not been renovated over decades, so cars operating there can be seen that are only seen in museums.
Where are we going?
Most of Cuba's most famous places don't go.
So there's no need to write too much about Varader or the Havanna.
Maybe we should just remember that there is a museum in Hemingway, mentioned earlier, and who likes the writer, you don't have to stop visiting this museum.
The Vináles River Cuba is one of the most fertile parts of the quiet part of the river.
Her boob is a woman from the desert.
Mechanical designs, sand-grains and shillings rise from the bottom of the river and in their fields, producing a fertile soil, which also results in stowed streams.
The flower is a place where they may produce the best quality baby doll.
They may meet in the final form when they visit some of the morning ice-creaming plant.
Some may also find it interesting that Zeman's Chilean episode was conducted there.
Trinidad
An ancient city, not long after Spanish river colonization.
News and beauty have been brought into the slave trade and sugar trade.
The economy is the body that has been killed in the beauty and monumental beauty of a small city.
No changes were made during the four centuries of the construction of the pharmaceutical Spain which was significantly affected by later French immigrants.
The territory between the Escambray and the sea is so fragile that in the last century there were no roads that would have been connected with the other parts of the country.
The certain excitement helped keep him out.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't break down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If man has more time for Trinidad than one day, he wants to look at the interesting places around him like the Playa Ancón party or the Sugar Mountains.
And tonight, it's like going to Casa de la Música, which is where music is quiet in the morning.
Baracoa
Some of the cities located in the eastern part of Cuba are considered the highest.
I'm sure this opinion will affect your way.
Both Guantanamo guides the high and narrow mountain ranges, which are driven by human activity to a relatively low level of nature.
Due to its unintended nature, Cuba has adopted the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Here it is prepared with the best chocolate, in the church there is a Columbus cross (acted in fact hundreds of years after Columbus' ship) and the dombrey where the first hotel is in El Castillo, some of which is the most famous El Yunque.
The coffee, rum, candles, Sierra Meastro, the Diszno ombudsman and Isla de Pinos, the Tropical Bareque, the Caridad del Cobra, the St.
As they say, it's better to see it once.
Afghanistan's allies are passengers, they're Americans.
A small army and a lack of equipment will also affect the mission of the United States of America.
According to Mr Robert Gates, NATO should develop specific plans for the following years.
The Afghan mission is not adjudicated, the leaders of the countries in Edinburgh, which have units in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing opposition to the Taliban movement, the eight participating countries also advise on further Union plans and coordination.
While the United States has been more active with the cooperation of the Defence Minister Robert Gates this week, NATO teams, Great Britain are considered to be the first to strengthen the Afghan government and strengthen development assistance.
"The development of Afghanistan can be fascinating, but the military force can only be part of the solution.
The rest of the population will be able to start further economic and security development for themselves," said BBC Defence Minister Des Browne.
Nine hundred
The activities of Afghan seniors, according to the U.S. government's data, have been the most powerful in the last five years.
The number of violent acts over the past year has increased by 27 percent and by 60 percent in the southern Helmand.
NATO has some 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, the largest one in the south.
However, according to the United States, the associations also reached their limits in the organization and equipment of the teams.
In particular, additional helicopters, soldiers and experts were asked to provide Afghan teams.
"We have to think carefully about the future and how to achieve these," says Gates.
He spoke in a similar spirit today to Jaap de Hope, NATO chief.
"I am not pleased with what is in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
Around nine percent of the soldiers and we have equipment that we would need, and this is small," said the Reuters News Agency De Hope at the end of a three-day discussion with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Passive
There have been discussions among participating countries over the past few months whether it is all binding to provide the maximum in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticised for passports.
"The Germans are in a relatively large number of existences in Afghanistan.
However, they were introduced into areas where the minimum force and the requirements for war are not as high against them as against us in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
This week, the Sun Brit's bloc called the German soldiers to be shot.
"The Afghan days are up: Germans are playing until our sons are fighting," Sun wrote in a photo of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German opposition to Bill and a British team in southern Afghanistan published a photo of the emergency bombing.
In 2009, the government reached one billion
It's a total of 44,000 crowns.
By the end of September, the whole debt had reached 842.7 billion kroner.
The government is planning to borrow $159.2 billion in this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced this plan by 152.8 billion koruna thanks to better development of the public budget.
The Czech Republic's government reached a total of 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
In the nine months of the year, this has increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June, 13.4 billion crowns have decreased.
The Ministry of Finance has today verified the public data from October.
Each of them has more debts than 44,000 korones.
Tavaly has paid over 11 billion crowns a year.
"In the meantime it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit of the next year, we would only be able to reach the single billion crown limit in 2009.
The next year the debt will move around 900 billion and a billion crown," said the iHNed.cz server's Patria Finance analyst, David Marek.
Similarly, the Next Finance analyst, Vladimir Pikora: "In 2009, we can move through a billion.
That exactly when it depends on the next unknown budget.
If you were to prove that the situation in the political area would change, politicians would be willing to be more involved by 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Increasing Duties
The government is responsible for the central government's debts, which are primarily due to the reduction of government deficits.
The government shall be financed by financial notes, public loans, direct loans or, for example, by the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal sales totalled 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion korunas for one year.
The foreign debt of the State increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion korunas.
By the end of September, the so-called salesable government had reached 803.3 billion kroner and 13.7 billion kroner from June.
The average incidence of statelessness has increased by 6.5 years.
"The whole year's debt increased by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is actually quite large in terms of economic growth.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated by loans where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that she's in debt, but on the other hand it shows that she's going to trade when the pension reform is here," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
It is clear from the funding strategy and from the government’s 2007 management that the government has planned to invest 159.2 billion dollars in loans.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion koruna thanks to better development of the public budget.
The amount is primarily the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach the estimated korona 91.3 billion instead of the 76 billion korona.
In addition, the Czech Consolidation Agency has planned a maximum of 13.3 billion kroner resources, 10 billion kroner content for the payment of pensions, 43 billion kroner financing of state loans and 1.8 billion kroner loans from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher today stands for a cardboard court because of the name given to a ploussmackon
I was sentenced to 15 days in prison and expelled from the country by a court of court to serve as a lawyer for the violation of Islam by British teacher in Sudan.
The British woman was accused of allowing her students from 6 to 7 years of age to name a silver coin to Mohammed. However, Islam’s religion prevents her prophet from portraying any kind of painting.
Such acts may be punishable by torture.
The 54-year-old British woman who was taught by the Cartoon Unity High School was detained on Sunday in her own apartment. Under paragraph 125 of the Swedish Penal Code, she was charged with breaking up Islam and having been charged with harassment after her parents repeatedly complained against the Swedish Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her six - to seven - year - old students to answer the name of the school’s plastic bag.
"The children proposed eight names – including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohamed," says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, with 23 votes, 20 children chose the name Mohammed.
Of course, Mohammed is the prophet name of Islam, but he is also a very common Christian in Sudan.
The children then prepared a joint diary with his photo of the cat and the "My name is Mohamed".
The problem is that the prophet's description of any kind of violation of Islam has not been made to the macaroni.
Gillian Gibbons, one of his colleagues at the same school, said that he knew him well and that the teacher would never have done anything to cause any religious conviction. He thought it was "an innocent mistake" saying, "I'm sorry that he voted with the children."
The teacher's many students agree with this opinion. We think the teacher's "very bad with the kids" and "never talks about religion in the classroom".
Do not forget that the second most famous Christian name in the United Kingdom is Mohammed, and there are 14 different forms of writing in English.
This is one way of expressing respect for the prophet by the many Christian families. (It is usually the first child born of the family.)
But what are the rules regarding the use of the Christian name?
Can you get this name for example a game?
This is obviously a question of understanding.
There was no agreement on the future status of the substance during the last peace negotiations in Wednesday.
The outcome: shit.
Without approaching the positions, the debate between the Serbs and Kosovo Albanians will end in the second and last talks on the future status of separatist heritage in Baden, Austria.
"It is commendable that the parties did not agree on the status," said Wolfgang Ischinger's EU diplomat in a peace press release.
The American continent, Frank Wisner, stressed that in the region, peace is "in serious danger", and encouraged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises of peace and dialogue after the negotiations.
"In the near future, we don't have to hold on to strengths, but it's going to be very difficult," he added, stressing "the existence of obvious differences."
Done at Brussels, 10 December.
The last weekend is the European Union, the United States of America and Russia in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the Albanian population in the 90th century can be clarified after Aleksandr Bocan-Harcsenko submits his report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
In the vicinity of Bécs, a discussion took place in Baden, the sixth and last session of the negotiations, after further communication with the United Nations in August.
The Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation tasks will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already reduced the case of Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, argued that negotiations would continue after the deadline.
"Russia has been committed to Russia and it remains the solution to the debate, along with the compromise," said Bocan-Harcsenko.
An independent declaration?
After 8 years under the leadership of the United Nations, Kosovo believes that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina stated that it was ready to challenge its independence if the Security Council did not decide on its behalf.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
"We have failed to reach agreement," said the Kosovo President, Fatmir Sejdiu in the Baden hotel where "the last opportunity for negotiations has been under way for a week."
Hashim Thaci, the former commander of Kosovo's rise and the minister of the province, expressed his regret.
However, he added that his idea of Belgrade's autonomy "would be the continuation of the past in killings and deportations."
"Domino-Effectus"
Serbian President Boris Tadic said that the compromise was still possible, and he warned the majority under Kosovo, with regard to the consequences of the unilateral challenge of independence.
Belgrade has the same "domino effect" in its nineties of independence still in an unstable area.
"For Serbia, this does not block the possibility of compromise," Tadic said.
The Serbian delegation welcomed the decision to be the only Security Council in which Russia is bound by protective law.
"The Kosovo Parliament will be the last word"
"Only a solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," announced Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"The negotiations lasted two years.
They must reach the same end as they started in the Security Council."
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that "the Kosovo Parliament will be the last word". He added that the unilateral challenge of independence from the Albanians is based on the "adjustment" of peaceful powers.
Bush Emergency Agreement between Israel and Palestine
Mr. George Bush welcomed the opening of the International Peace Conference in Maryland, Annapolis, which announced that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmúd Abbasz agreed to start an endless debate on the final settlement of the 60-year dispute between their peoples.
Bush, in the presence of the two Presidents, promised to support them in any way possible in order to sign the "peace agreement" in 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians have to calculate "terrorist networks", and Israel has to abandon its manufacturing activities - reported Bush and reminded both sides of its commitments to "beke-out plan" adopted in 2003.
The leader of the White House stressed that Abbas had conducted negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel "a signing of a peace agreement which is the problem of all the relevant issues, including central issues".
These are the last three most difficult problems facing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: Palestine's future borders, the situation of Jerusalem and the Arab race from their homes during the 1948 conflict, which took place in the territory of the State of Israel today.
After the US President-in-Office Abbass also pointed out that future negotiations would be "globally and in-depth" and would affect all areas of regulation, such as "Jerusalem, airport, borders, colonies, water and security".
After that, Mr Manert promised that future negotiations would be "inconceivable and ongoing", and he will ensure that they "will be completed in 2008.
By the end of 2008, Bush set fire to the "two-State vision" of the Palestinian and Israeli side.
Saudi Arabia declared that he had received a promise from Bush before he agreed to take part in the conference.
Saudi Arabia (which had written an Annapolis participation as a success in Washington) has initiated a plan with the support of all Arab countries to ensure Israel's peace when it emerged from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis "responsesively in the history of the Middle East, especially because it raises the problem and focuses on central issues" - says the Saudi priest in his interview with the Saudi-owned Arab daily.
According to the attorney, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As usual, it is common to be on news like this, the official position and your speech against each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data of the investigation initiated by the National Police Supervisory Authority (IGPN), a police officer in the town of Villaries-le-Beel, some 17 minutes later.
"The car was driving, so it didn't take part in the action. It went 40-50 km/h without sirens," we knew from the police source.
The two young "high-speed" without shoes carried a green "not included in the official registration, so it can't be used in road traffic" (see below) with Kawasaki market engine.
"Because they didn't have the right-hand rule, the engine hit the left-hand side of the police force," says one police officer.
The result of the alcohol test performed on the road was negative.
It's good to show the intensity of the shooting that the car's start has crashed, the protective star has collapsed, and the shooter's gone.
In his extraordinary report yesterday morning, Marie-Thérèse de Givry announced that IGPN and Val-D'Oise were entrusted with the investigation "because of the lack of human resources and assistance."
In the course of the afternoon, the prosecutor said in a press release that the responsibility of the police for the current phase of the IPPN investigation could be excluded.
According to the prosecutor, the victim's three-night hearing officer confirmed "the police officer's accountant, which said that the robot came from the left side of the police station relatively quickly."
On the day of yesterday, from a piece that was twice as likely to be dragged by the guards on the road, it was shown that the two vehicles had been assembled and had crossed together until the police officer had been able to relocate.
Vehicles were taken for technical purposes.
The two victims were subjected to a medical examination yesterday on their bodies.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday as a runner, Villaries-le-Beel spoke, which said the police quickly withdrew from the scene without helping the two young people.
In this regard, the IGPN is cautiously aware, but only that the police would have followed "any serious error".
"This is the most important part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation and greater caution during this period," we learned from a police source.
The Liberation met with an eyewitness who counted a few minutes after the accident.
One of his apartment's gates is exactly on the scene.
"My cousin, who's a hospital nurse, we're going to make sure we're trying to relive them," says the eyewitness.
"We couldn't do anything."
Then he noticed "an officer who was completely disturbed and convicted.
The other two tried to relive one young man, and the fourth called."
As the situation of the two young people has become apparent, the situation has been widened around the present, so the coming police have transported their colleagues out of the scene by car.
At the same time, we know from the audience that the rescuer came "about 20 minutes after the police were evacuated."
They also used heart rate, but they didn't.
"I'm not saying that the police didn't try to help the kids.
The young people got their help.
The firemen came to the scene right away.
They did everything they could to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
Women of the Distinction in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police stopped the first meetings of a need-based agency brought up by General Musaraf two days ago.
In the eastern part of the country, around two against the measures taken during the need-for-station period, the public prosecutor was injured by light gas bombs used by the regulatory forces.
In response, they shot the police who were more injured.
At least 350 lawyers have been produced.
Similar events took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and destroyed them.
They've produced more people.
In your Islamic camp, you were referred to the General Court of Justice, which was registered as the Supreme Court, and you reported meetings on the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers at the end of the week.
In order to stop the assembly on Wednesday morning, the roads leading to the Supreme Court were closed.
There were also more meetings in the central part of the country in Multan and the northern Peshawar.
For a week, the lawyer's movement has also been supported by a powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amalis-Amal Association which has supported religious parties. "The leader encouraged the people to send flowers to those judges who do not understand the need for one, and to those who did so before Musaraf."
"Museraf's promise is no longer valid"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan shall directly address the exceptional measure notified on Saturday night.
The Court shall declare on the following days the law of 6 October, President Musaraf, on the re-election of the House of Commons by a vote.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from his dignity and replaced by another one.
"We are witnesses, illegal, illegal and contrary to the Supreme Court's decisions," said the President to the newspaper The News.
President Pervez Musaraf's promise, which he makes to remove from his military experience in order to play the role of the civil president, "was lost" after the need was introduced - he informed the Minister of Information, Tariq Azeem on Monday.
As of 15 November, Musaraf had to choose from the military uniform until the end of his first presidential term.
The Ministry of Information has also confirmed the report on the death of the January elections.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government has spoken in a wide-ranging way in its own country, which, according to President Musarraf, would have indicated the requirement of military service.
No more than one third of the weights planned
This result includes unwanted (24%) or unplanned or unplanned pregnancy.
Even today, more than one third (36%) of the weights have not been planned - except for four years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act authorising adoption by the French National Demographic Institute (Ined).
This result includes unwanted (24%) or unplanned or unplanned pregnancy.
According to Ined, different methods of absorption such as tablet or muscle are still weak in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the institution, the liberalisation of adoption has made the "birth regulation" more effective. The study notes that women between the ages of 20 and 44 still received 5% of the acceptable tablet in 1970, but this rate has already been 60%.
You can say 8 out of 10 pregnant people have already planned.
Every five months, she plans carefully, and if possible, she'll be on her way, because this is the most difficult year for the child to be accepted.
Visual improvements in the colour list
Scott Parazynski had to work for more than seven hours in the letter in order to carry out a visual improvement of the state's scientific activity without being able to do so.
This dangerous radiation has also been recorded from several points of view: the improvement has been very long, very short time for planning and, apart from the housing modulations, "barcaced" numbers were to be carried out by the surgeons.
The problem was well reported when the surgeons were removed from the Discovery module of the Harmony. This is an essential part of the enormous volume that will soon take place in European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see section requested).
This module is the same as the laboratory module.
However, it is necessary to take care of their prices.
The second task of the disease was to replace one of the modules that produced an electric price using 17.5 tonnes of daily tables, which was already in the ISS, to the final place.
Then the disease began to open the 76-metre-wide daily table.
One of the hormonally-concentrated tables then broke one of them at a distance of about 1 m in length.
In order to avoid further damage, the opening of the table was not continued.
The task of the astrologers was initially to conduct a control course on the Discovery orbitor and then to update another defective operating dayboard. Instead, they had to spend their entire time improving the damaged dayboard.
Scott Parazynskire was chosen to carry out the demonstration on a 30-metre-long robot with his seat belt.
He's one of NASA's best "healers".
You're strong, you've got a lot of business, you've got a lot of pride and a long career.
Therefore, a 46-year-old doctor should "megoperate" the "serious" daily table.
After thoroughly measuring the damage, he removed the wrong cable and set up some "coloured" area.
In his work he also helped another "healer" who stayed close to the safe passerby, as well as from inside the other hens, including the captain of the poverty, Peggy Whitson.
The number used by it, a mini xyhebot, which was seen with emphasis on hundreds of variations in the daily tables, was thought out and "barked" together.
After the operation was carried out, Scott Parazynski waited until his associates opened the table completely and then packed his records and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the nurses held half a day's rest, and this week they returned to Discovery's clock to start the computer's planned landing.
Price of EADS shares decreased
The price of EADS shares was very high on the Paris duty after the company which produced aircraft and defence equipment announced that the loss of A400M aircraft would result in an additional EUR 1.2-1.4 billion.
The price of EADS shares is currently EUR 21.96 after a 4% reduction.
The company had to review its forecasts for the 2007 operating performance as A400M engine is ready to be developed, which is clearly due to the delay in the delivery of the aircraft.
The delay in the transfer of the air carrier, which was reported in October, will amount to "EUR 1,2 billion and 1.4 billion, more than 1 billion of which are affected by Airbust" - has been reported by the parent company of the European EADS company.
As a result of the disclosure of these expenditure, EADS has to publish new plans for the 2007 business result in the future deficit when its quarterly results are reported - it has added to the company but has not published any further figures.
The group also noted that it took into account the six-month delay when preparing a new budget assessment.
In 2006, EADS’ business performance decreased by 86%: this was largely another programme, which was later introduced by A380, which could lead to a large financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to transfer A400M aircraft to the French army in October 2009.
Size & & Status
There is no great surprise in the summer elections: a large majority of Russians will vote for Putin State party in Russia.
In this case, the need for self-government is shown after a highly manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, the Russian state Vlagymir Putyin speaks on television to voters who have already been set up, but its content is still confidential.
Putyin leads the Kremlin Support Party, a list of the United Russia, which is expected to show the first victory in the elections.
At the time of the adoption of foreign officials yesterday, the state-owned behaviour was not worth anything: it was increasingly anti-crime against the intervention of the countries of the Pacific, which was the theme of the campaign.
"We know what price is for true democracy, so we want fair, absolutely transparent and open choices without any legal implications," he added.
However, the opposition says I'm early in this situation.
The opposition challenged the campaign in which we believe the voters were pressured.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gennagyij Zjuganov, says that "there has not been such a massive election in Russia in the time of Jelcin".
After the last weekend's arrest, the former World War I, Garri Kaszparov was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized detention, and his lawyer is still unable to be seen.
"The Russians still think like "homo soviticus"
Two more obvious questions are the results of the quantifiable selection:
- Who's after Putyin in the state department?
On the official page yesterday, the date of the first turn of the presidential election, which will be 2 March 2008, was announced and the signs may be induction deadlines until 23 December 2008.
Since Vlagymir Putynt was elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate will no longer be extended.
But there's no other way around here.
- What role does Putyin play from March?
Will you be the Prime Minister?
Or will he decide on the government and the President as a member of the United Kingdom or as Head of Parliament?
In any event, the removal of power will win both Parliament and the presidential elections.
It's almost her turnout.
"The Russians still think about 'homo soviticus' method: they don't feel like they can run the race," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the centre of independent Levada.
Nyikolya Koposzov, the history of St. Petersburg University is still different: it is thought that the country has been a Christian for five hundred years later, so it is late to develop civil society.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, "Putyin returned to the pattern of patriarchalism, which the people were perfectly suited to. More than that, because this new type of patriarchalism was not a threat but a certain economic advantage," says Maria Lipman, the Carnegie Foundation worker.
In our days the Russians are "inspired of personal responsibility" which has been demonstrated soon after the fall of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
The presence affects all levels of society, even the business world.
The Board of Directors was interested in maintaining the current situation: 65 Heads of Government of the United Kingdom of Russia from 85 Russian regional leaders.
And freedom from slavery from Nuuga is often the cause of frustration, as it happened in the 1990s.
The opinion is for the sake of stability.
As a result, the Russians do not vote in favour of the parties.
54-year-old teacher Tamara Cserednycsenko said: "Why should we think?
The people in power aren't so bad, why should we beat them up?"
Reminders
After more than 60 years of secretion, my Bad Arolsen archive has become public, documenting a series of 17 and half million victims of Hitler's massacre.
The 47 million archive document, which contains 27 km radiuss in Bad Arolsen, which is located in Hessen, has so far been only for "human" purposes, that is, only for individual and name-specific victims or for their victims.
In May 2006, researchers and historians from Germany, France, Israel and the United States agreed to open up their archives.
After all the States ratified the Convention, the archives were opened yesterday.
Certain information
The opening of Bad Arolsen's paper makes it possible for historians to carry out research "with regard to the transfer of infected persons, the population of the camps and the health status of forced labour" - explains Reto Meistern, director of the archive managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
To date, several countries, including Germany, have also rejected the publication of their publications, as they contain names and thus contain reliable information.
For example, there may be a conditioned homosexuality or spiritual disability of certain deported victims.
The records of the concentration camps and the arrest orders issued by the Gestapo began to be collected for practical reasons after the war. The aim was to find out whether or not individuals who were convicted of deported or forced labor and, if possible, to serve as evidence of their internalization, which could be involved in damage.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent workers are currently involved in processing the specific needs of tens.
However, a part of the scientific community does not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive to be of great importance.
"These documents contain no news on the basis of any of these," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre for Anti-Semitism in Berlin.
The EU and India would sign a free trade agreement in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade is now approaching EUR 60 billion at an annual level.
The EU is the first trading partner in India and gives 18% of foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope that they can sign the Free Trade Agreement in 2008 - Peter Mandelson announced European Trade Security and Kamal Nath Indian Trade Minister.
The EU Foreign Ministers have already agreed in April that the European Commission will start negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The annual trade in Indo-European bilateral trade is now approaching EUR 60 billion.
The EU is the first trading partner in India and gives 18% of foreign trade.
In addition, the EU is India’s largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU’s 9th most important trading partner according to the European Commission’s figures.
Peter Mandelson explained that "a free trade agreement could have an economic impact on both sides", and " India could thus increase its presence on a 450 million-based flowering market".
Ten of the most important products exported by India to Europe were the first or second largest importers of Europe. The two series, Europe and Asia, each year, "47 billion euros" and "10 billion euro-valued services" were added to each other - reported in the week by Danielle Smadja, the head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi. At the same time, he expressed regret that bilateral trade "is still not fully understood". In the EU and India, New Delhi, New Zealand, the eightth Diplomacya is located in Sinhalcókt, and Manzno and Manzno.

Answer to concerns: the Bank of England offers 10 billion points for the money market for five weeks
The Bank of England would like to alleviate credit insecurity, so it was disappointed that 10 billion English pounds were pumped to the financial market, which makes it available at 5.75% on a basis and on a regular basis for five weeks.
"We would like to ease the concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, but we would also like to see that banks can plan their liquidity positions more safely for this period, which is why the Bank's content will provide a significant part of a five-year open market operation on the international financial market from 6 December" - says the bank's press release.
According to the bank, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12:15 p.m. on the local time. The offer will be valid on the basis of the bank's record and the deadline for payment will be 10 January.
This is the first time the Bank of England has released five loans for the first time in the form of an open market operation.
These operations usually take up a week.
In its press release, the Bank of England added that "all further measures are to be taken" in order to justify bank internal credit on the basis of the bank record.
The current central bank rate was 5,829% on Wednesday.
And the three-month drop was over on 18 September: it's currently 6.6%.
Since the start of the January financial market crisis, the Bank of England has taken into account a significant amount of fines for the amounts of the money market pumped, which has resulted in the repayment of the banks from these requirements.
According to your speech (which only strengthens the price flow of the euro) they would be much more pleased with the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which could be accompanied by a more costly and more discreet approach.
UMP and NC are not willing to examine the socialist proposal relating to the buyer
The UMP and the Nouveau Centre Group decided to discuss articles of the Socialist Law on the buyer, which are equivalent to the rejection of the text.
At the meeting held by the socialists, there were about ten text measures which were adopted by the National Bureau of the Socialist Party, including 50 % increase in employment rates, the transfer of food, the introduction of travel tickets and the reduction of customs duties.
Since the UMP and NC 180:115 voted against the examination of the articles, the government party and the opposition were closed to a lively exchange of words at the same time. For only a few hours, President Nicolas Sarkozy had talked about the purchaser on television.
The head of the socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrawt, said that his group would resubmit all proposals under the appropriate financial draft amendment which would be made for the National Assembly's calendar next week.
They're born at a new festival
A number of conversations were held with C3 Presents in connection with a new philadelfian music festival. However, the event was announced by an organizer and promoter company that Melvin Benn Brit was organized in collaboration with the Festival Republic in New Jersey.
"It is a compliment to us that we can work with a man who is the founder of the American festival today," stated Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
The C3 organizes the Chicago Lollapalooza festival and the Austin City Limits music festival.
It's going to be a party party in New Jersey, so it's gonna be a way of doing it.
The festival takes place between August 8 and 10, in a private area of about 400 square miles [40 sq km] from Philadelphia.
The director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989 he started the British Reading Festival, which takes about 80,000 visitors every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn further expanded his palace with the organization of the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 he invited the Festival Republic to live at the Latitude Festival at Henham Park.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been involved in the production, licensing and organisation of Glastonbury Festival. This festival is now up to 177,500 people.
The C3 worker, Charlie Jones of Glastonbury, called the "most inspiring event" that he once participated in. He added that his company and Melvin Benn work together to manage a European-style festival.
"We have already selected Philatelfia in advance, and we worked hard together with the Fairmount Parks Commission to organize this in the center of the festival Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"We continued to trade with the city, and the Commission showed great interest in our plan.
Sadly, however, because of the political nature of the city leadership, the organization was full of failure," continued Charlie Jones.
"We were lucky to talk about this with Melvin Benn, and now we're preparing to organize an awful festival in another unique location with which we're also serving the interests of the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents returned to life in 2005 at Lollapalooza at the Chicago Grant Park, after he had already demonstrated the outstanding ability of festival organizers with the Austin City Limits music festival.
The gross income of the two orders in 2007 was 9.8 million or 11.3 million dollars.
You're both partying at a local event.
"Melvin Benn's European concept is building a rural festival while our festivals are systematically being held in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to bring together the two models in some way, creating both European rural landscapes and urban experiences that are common in America."
It is located about half a mile between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Vineland's population, you're also the mayor of town who's actively supporting the event," says Charlie Jones.
While not talking about the details of the agreement, it states that "the conditions are sufficiently favourable to allow for an investment in such an arrangement in a place which is likely to give the festival a long time to go home".
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be "orie" size, according to the great reception capacity of the Bonnaroo music festival in Tennessee.
The partners have already accepted the invitation to the event, but nothing is yet final at the time of the publication.
"Vineland is going to be a rock festival, but we're planning a variety of musical gifts to everyone to find out the truth about his brother," says Charlie Jones.
Jones and two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal are together with C3 companies, which the latest Billboard Touring Awardson received the recognition of "the best independent organization".
Montreal vs. Terminal
It's not easy for Hollywood officers to get to Montreal if you have to work with the Terminator...
The "interruptible" is part of the mission sent by the visual.
The mission is "politically difficult" because the California government, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is opposed to the sale of its own products abroad.
Is it really hard to take the fight with the Terminator Governor?
"We need to be careful because the filmmaker decides which is for the best position.
If you think you like the conditions in Montreal, you're gonna go there.
Our task is to provide the best possible conditions, which are based on our decision," says Schwarzenegger.
Competition for festivals
Denis Turcotte, however, is now more focused on making Canadian films more popular.
The same competition started for the Oscars.
The purpose of showing and streaming more Quebec film at every American film festival is to be the Sundance Film Festival, either at the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
L'Ége des December was a few weeks of welcome at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
The Palm Springs International Festival will be held in January.
The Shakespeare Hands with the Devil is shown in Santa Monica and on November 30th at the Starz Denver Film Festival.
Québec also represented himself with four short films and four games this month at the American Film Institute Festival.
Will the year end rally on the roof? The experts share their opinion with the "subprime" reality.
In almost five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are already clearing the fields and almost waiting for the end of the ordinary year.
However, it is not clear to experts that this will really happen.
According to Banif, "his attitude is generally positive from a statistical point of view in December.
However, only the statistics backlogs are not necessarily present, in the present situation there is uncertainty about the market, at least for a short time."
Experts will soon share the final discharge of the tax year, although it is stated that "the tax deficit is above the present state of liquidity, giving this opportunity for investment as there are no guarantees options, especially the fixed amount which is negative for the return on quality securities as long as short as possible".
This is why we believe that there will be no more side effects of movement than volitivity, "mostly because the effect of the cut-off on the foot is unknown, the price of the gain oil is the same high and the threat of inflation".
Javier Barrio, the BPI's sales responsibility for Spain's agreement with this, i.e. it would be dangerous to declare it to be rally.
According to the expert, "the situation is not a problem at all."
The loss of Ibex represents almost 4 percent of the highest values recorded on 8 November when index 15.945.7 closes.
Anyway, not all experts are so bourgeois.
According to Juan Solana, Intermoney's analysis of Ibex 35 to 16,000 points can also close the year due to the reorganization of the stocks and payments to the regular rest base at the same time.
In this case, the expert adds that some changes can be expected, since the second week of the rally December, after the long week of the Act of Accession.
The analyser considers that volatility would affect market trends.
Federico Olucha, according to the Inversis Banco analysis, we are close to the technical level and "so we can experience the return of the tax index, which can also increase in the dependence of US news on the consequences of the credit market".
The examiner trusts them to be favorites.
The analysts agree on what will be the value papers to achieve the new maximum quotas for Ibex.
Solana, from Intermoney, emphasizes that "but the series is in large securities."
The expert would include two large banks and some construction companies on the list, "as long as the electricity sector is going to be very expensive".
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco states that the increase is due to the banking sector and industry.
For construction companies, the rally can be positive, of course, if it is at all.
"The ACS has been trying to regain its position for several months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow this path," says the expert.
Ccyclical consumption will be the main contributor of the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales available during the Christmas marketing period.
On the other hand, experts say that technology companies can do well, although in this area there is not too high a representation on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, there has been a two-fold decline in the price of December.
In 2003 we were able to see the real year's rally when the dust particles emerged from the crisis caused by the explosion of technological bubbles.
In this year, when Ibex was reduced by 35 28,17 percent, 6.68% of the population was registered in December.
So it is still open that 2007 will be the fifth year of each other's success (now Ibex shows an increase of 8.36% since January) and can result in the final rally.
Banco Popular Spain opens from 200 weeks to 12 hours on Saturday
The Banco Popular Spanish has decided that most of his sons are doing it.
This is all about 200 boys in the most commercially concerned parts of Spain.
Those guys are running under the name of Popular Max, and they're making a big change for the bank.
However, for other Spanish institutions, this is the first group to be kept open from 10 a.m. to 20 a.m. on Saturday.
The other group, the BBVA, which has heard several times that his sons are planning to open up longer, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
However, he is currently preparing to agree with his professional organisations, which says he would close 75% of his sons to open his shop on a Sunday, although not for the public.
The experiences of the Banco Popular Spain will be crucial for other institutions, and they will decide on the same basis whether they will be involved in the initiative to support the more openness of businesses.
This is exactly the goal of the Banco Popular Spanish project.
I would like to target individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual businesses and local businesses in those places.
The Bank of Spain would like 200 boys to work with the abovementioned opening for 18 months, not on the same new opening arrangement, but on the change in the existing one.
To this end, the institution modernises its own sonnets found in trade fairs, as required by the clients of certain roads.
In this way, the extension of the time of the opening process will reflect a new kind of thinking of the presence of the boys, more modern, more colorful design.
The responsibility of the trading banks, Ángel Rivera, shows that there is no need for a large investment in the reorganisation, but they need to employ more than eight or nine employees per head.
The boys who are also given seats for SMEs are not going to sell financial products.
Favorite experiences
The initiative has already been implemented by the three sons of the Banco Popular Spanish.
According to Ángel Rivero, the experiences were interesting.
The election took place for boys in the streets of Madrid Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to Rivero, the decision proved to be correct.
The Spanish People's Bank currently has 2,500 children.
More than 60 are working under the name of the WorldCredit, specialized in immigrants, and there is a very interesting opening order, even on Sundays and holidays.
In the units mentioned in PopularMax, the model BBVA is not used where some boys offer a wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our clients," says Rivero.
They are currently able to make a decision with Telephonica and sell mobile phones using external personnel.
Telecinco is the first to double the value of an Antena 3 Tözstede
"We did it."
With this statement, he concluded yesterday about the satisfaction of the market when Paolo Vasile, his trusted adviser to Telecinco, found out that the TV driven by him had doubled the value of Antena 3.
He said, "It's just the pain that this isn't because we're getting bigger, but because we're smaller," he said.
Even so, he played a lot of weight to make the weak market less night.
Telecinco closed with 254 percent force last night.
This growth represents an annual loss of 15.66 percent.
The company's 52 percent is Mediaset, 13 percent Vocento is Vocento, and according to Bloomberg's data 4,488.88 million.
Rivalisa, who lost 1,52 percent yesterday and 40,5 percent since January, can write the story, so on half yesterday, for 2,193,46 million.
The other reported communications company is estimated at 3.571 million in Sogecable; in Prisa (Finco Días costs), 2.518.53 million and in Vocento 1.779 million.
According to Vasile, the comparison between Antena 3 is known to be similar between the two companies.
The question is just how much we can do in the same market as the costs and how much of everything is going on in the field of vision.
Last week, Telecinco announced that it would like to be the first one billion-billion-accident TV player, Giuseppe Tringali, the consultant appointed by Telecinco and the Publicespaña.
If the reported fact is true, the revenue from the announcement will be estimated at 965.4 million in the financial year 2006 at 3.6 per cent in the time financial year.
The net sales of Antena 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the financial year (and reached 734.4 million), while the net price of television increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
According to the analysts, one of the factors behind Telecinco Tözsdei's legacy was the long-term high payout: in 2006 the company led by President Alejandro Echevarría divided 100% of its shares.
Vasile says - although it would be too early to decide - this rate can be changed with the parent company after taking 33% of Endemol, together with the Mediaset.
"We are officially guaranteeing a minimum of 50% payment, although we've always divided up a lot more.
I hope our members will be happy with us here, as we have already liked them with the acquiescence of the 33% of Endemol."
According to the analysts, the market is currently characterised by some difficulties.
The Lehman Brothers recently reduced their contributions to Telecinco by 7 percent in 2008 and 2009.
According to them, this is known to reduce the estimated price increases from 10.5 per cent in 2008 to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent in 2009.
According to the same company, Antena 3 gains by 4.5 percent in 2008 and 7.5 percent in 2009.
3 opinions
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Ibersecurities: it proposes to buy both securities, mainly due to high profitability and long-term sustainability.
Two.
Caja Madrid: You see Telecinco as a favorite (purchasing) for the "multiplicity" and business strength of Antena 3.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, it recommends lowering due to "a similar risk" (the most favourable market and economic climate).
Adopted by the Congress on 1 November.
Parliament's case - which today has closed its amendments to the Senate - has initiated a public social dialogue on the rule of law that is still in force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups unanimously outlined the efforts made by representatives and senators in negotiations and agreements which have served as the most difficult normative normative for the creation of investors, as well as detailed rules on the activities of companies, for the effective functioning of the market.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Rules, enables the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening the protection of investors, broadens the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation among the various European Union supervisors.
The new Directive makes it possible for the financial advisor to provide a new form of financial service (ESIS) to specialised companies, but also to natural or legal persons, as well as to investment firms, investment firms and portfolio management companies (AFIs).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems applicable to the implementation of financial instruments operations, thus contributing to the regulated secondary markets the multilateral trading platforms and confidence-building internalisation systems that are competing with the present players.
In addition, the Rules require market information on the aspects, risk management and risk management methods of business profiles for investment service providers, as well as on all operations carried out to facilitate the control of CNMV.
The Committee on Economic Affairs of the Congress has made a number of amendments, one of which is that it is of high importance that the securities are treated as a "complex" financial instrument, and also because of the high risk reported for the investor.
On the other hand, the transposition of the Directive was also used to legalize the functioning of the business environment of those with economic and business performance. For 30 years after the entry into force of the Royal Regulation, which was introduced in 1977 by only the competent authorities.
The Senate also proposed the establishment of new players in the financial sector, such as the brokering agent working on another account, which does not need the authorisation of CMMV and can sell products or buy customers for several investment firms at the same time.
The Consumer Index grew by 0.5 points in November and reached 4.1%.
This figure, taken into account by Eurostat for the calculation of the European Union rate of inflation, shows the establishment of Spanish prices by November.
The publicisation of Eurostat and the European Central Bank is consistent with its strategy to provide data that can be compared with data coming from the United States, both at the time of their entry into force and in terms of their identity.
The previous indicator number shall apply to the calculation method as to the calculation of the United Kingdom Price Index, but the statistical modeling method shall differ from the assessment of information which is not yet available at the moment of bringing it to the public.
The Statistical Office has stated that the preliminary indicator number is only an indication, so it may differ from the final data to be made public on 14 December.
"The Consumer Index continues to show relatively high values."
Pedro Solbes, one of the government's Vice-Presidents and the Minister for Economic Affairs, said that the increase in Consumer Price Index at 4.1% on November was only "temporary", but it also pointed out that the price index is expected to show "very high" values in the coming months.
In the course of this Parliament, Solbes confirmed that "although my indicator is not really interesting", Spain's rate of inflation remained at least the same in the monetary union over the last few years.
It also added that the November was "lower surprise" than the previous month when the Government did not count on such a large increase.
"We've been waiting for around 4 %" the Minister of Economic Affairs recognized the data that has been made public during today.
The Northern Rock would like to reach EUR 42 billion in the Virgin for three years.
More than 50% of Northern Rock's revenue is recovered and currently only 12 billion pounds (16 billion 800 million euros) have been issued since the mid-September crisis and an urgent loan was to be received from the National Bank of England.
There was still a record number of over 25 billion worth of money, which has gradually reduced the number of customers over the past two and a half months, despite the fact that the Government had promised the bank a percentage guarantee until the end of the crisis.
Virginia will operate this unit under its own financial, commercial name. Virgin Money will have to acquire about four quarters of the British banks' revenues in the next three years to get the remaining 18 billion points and achieve 30 billion targets.
Richard Branson’s group of large-scale businessmen who became known with large-scale advertising campaigns in England was convinced that each year some 50 million pounds (that is 70 million euros) would be spent on advertising and marketing in order to achieve the desired goal.
The Northern Rock released the Virginia Consortium's proposal this week as the most convenient way to avoid your effort.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for a alleged corruption case
The Police arrested the mayor of Totana’s settlement in Murcia’s province (Néppart) today because it is suspected that he was involved in the city’s corruption bombing this week.
They arrested one of the Secretaries of the House of Városa and the Chief of Police of the Construction.

This was announced by the PSOE Serbian Secretary, José Blanci, at a press conference and you confirmed Bono's communication with Zapatero in the heart of the party's association today.
The Prime Minister commended the former Minister for choosing "the best we have to count" in politics, and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, it added that "probably" the manchai politician will mark the socialist party to the honour of the President of Parliament if socialists win the next elections.
Mr Bono would take the place of current President Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he would not be able to step up the next elections and political careers after fighting climate change.
The former Minister acknowledged that the Head of Government has consistently urged him to return to the political stage two years ago with active politics.
He added that since the voters are clear about who the Economic Vice-President will be in the case of the Socialists' victory, the party would also like to inform them of the "visibility" of the President of Parliament.
If Bono is really doing the job, he would like Parliament to be "the level of respect and not the level of injury or abuse" and to be better compared to the home of the citizens.
"It seems sad at times that Parliament is the only place in Madrid where it can't be spoken quietly, it has already happened that the President's speech has been broken into by 26 times in the Senate."
At the same time, he commended current President Manuel Marín for his "excellent work" but he did not want to present himself as a president so that his opponents would not be considered "substantiated".
The campaign for the weather
Since the air change-producing movement is unbiased, it must be very strong, both in terms of appearances and in terms of political or social decisions.
In fact, you have to set up a political leader such as Governor Zapatero, who believes that the movement is more important than the fight against Islam against terrorism, and declares that "we must enter into a new agreement with our country".
However, this note raises the question of how much the Government’s activity or inaction has contributed to the failure of Spain to comply with the Kyoto Convention.
Who are responsible for not keeping the agreement, which sector is concerned, and why has the Government not failed to prevent it?
In addition, it should be clear to the Spanish what measures are being taken to improve climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, what changes in the population normally need to make, what energy savings we need to take into account at a single and social level, and what economic consequences will this have?
Or who needs to offer a sacrifice and pay for saving our planet?
But we didn't get it and we won't get an explanation for these questions.
That's because it's about sacrifice and money.
The climate change has taken measures, and the actual measures are not always popular.
There are costs, comfort and expenses for both companies and the population.
Even the rise of PSOE would have been such a public failure before the elections that Zapatero quickly returned.
That Earth must be saved from nothing, from decayed propaganda texts, from empty, real consequences.
With agreements, commissions, records, new honours.
The Agreement with the Earth, as stated by the Governor who speaks so well in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, but enhances electoral assemblies and weaknesses in us.

Totana's mayor and chief of police were arrested for a alleged corruption case
The police arrested the mayor of Totana, the town of Murcai province, the populace José Martínez Andreot, the local chief of police, the secretary of the Városhaza and a visitor company for crimes related to city development.
The mayor was detained at home and then transferred to the Városázázá, where he is currently detained by several police officers who are closely investigating the government body responsible for the management of the Város Development Council and the Iparties and the Housing.
The three arrests were preceded by the detention of six persons in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia last week on a case during which the authorities were granted permission to establish 4,000 residences for the Galicia company after they had been illegally paid to the managers during their previous missions.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested, but they are under investigation according to information provided by the Court of First Instance.
The first six arrested persons were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, the former Mayor of Totana, Juan Morales, who is currently under investigation at the level of the independent parliamentary representative of Népart.
The former wife, owned by a property agency registered in Totana, is being examined at a level similar to that of her current friend of the former Mayor, who lives in the centre of Murcia.
The manager and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.The lawyer and entrepreneur were detained in Nigran (Pontevadra), together with the director of Suelo de Imonauur, Pablo José M.G.. The latter company belongs to the Nuaria Group and has been bound by it.
The investigation shall be carried out by a group of crimes committed at the Intergovernmental level by the Central Unit of the Police, members of which were held outside detentions, for the first time by companies in relation to detainees operating in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rosas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, only one person was arrested: the owner of a company that was well-known in a neighborhood for baroque products, which could play a central role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest apartment park in Totana for which 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels were built.
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was overrated. The project would have doubled its current population of 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonauur, Vigoban, Coruna, Venezuela, and Conycase, which are responsible for the management of the Coruna, Venezuelan roads and Catholic Ferdinand Parks, and Preconiza, which are dedicated to the sale, promotion and promotion of the direct marketing of Hogar and buildings.
Things That Go Away
I'm sorry.
If you agree, we're just a little afraid of the Honap Book, and look back at some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I've already been equipped with one.
People, the constant change in life.
Of course, everyone can figure something out.
Two.
Our Finnish scientist found this comment on one of the largest days of Finland: (of course, the PISA report of the world's operational level) in Helsinki Sanomat, which is also part of the criticism of the Blackburn book on 18 November.
"Philosophic teachings came up after the tragedy of Jokela gymnasium.
The killer and Nietzsche were quoted as writing from Plato and Nietzsche in his preteens.
Pekka Elo of the Helsinki Sanomat website, which was commissioned by the Teaching Council of Philosophy, demanded that teachers examine Plato's teachings critically, and then add that Nietzsche's knowledge is not necessarily important at school-based philosophical time."

One of his colleagues informed us that the Penal Code includes security related to Internet downloads:
A. A download of a number of music is safe and can be punished for a year from six months.
However, if you steal less than 400 euros in a shop, it is only normalisation (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal at 1000 euros in a shop, the thief is already a lawyer, but the penalty still does not apply to the level of a minor penalty in the case of online downloads (Article 234 BTK).
C. If you steal a car but return it within 40 hours, the penalty shall not yet apply to the amount of the fine that may be reduced if the internet is downloaded (244.1).
D. You can count on less punishment if you're in a fight than if you're second-hand.
If you take part in a mass war, you may receive a three-month extension penalty (Article 154 BTK), but a six-month two-year extension penalty for a second copy of the CD.
(BTK 270)
E. According to section 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD film.
F. The sale of films protected by copyright is more serious than the sale of pornography without the help of the contractors (186) than the sale of pornography.
If my colleague's right, someone's got a lot of things out of their hands.
4. (a) What does the Bible teach us?
I received an article from my doctor about foreign research, entitled "The cause of money's brain activity, especially if others are less involved".
So the day of the workers' feelings of pay depends on how many others have received.
The experiment was carried out in the University of Bonn with the scale of magnetic resonances, and the results were published in the latest issue of Science.
The author of the study and director of the German Life&Brain Neurology Group, Bernd Weber, said: "We measured the most powerful activity when the participant responded correctly, but the company was mistaken."
The researchers concluded that if both of them had given the right answer and had received the same amount of money, the mental activity was moderate, but if one of them had a double amount, the activity was also successful.
I don't know why there was such a great science for such a simple conclusion.
Head of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been sitting in front of the Office of the Criminal Court investigating the crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.
My mission comes down at the end of the year, and Carla is leaving with a small voice because of the responsibility of Srebrenica blood, during which 8000 Bosnian Muslims have been kidnapped, namely the Ratko Mladic and the Serbian Bosnian leader Radován Karadzsics.
Their name is on the list chosen by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as the title of the documentary: Carla's list (2006, Spain has not yet been shown). The film follows the work of the Swiss Chief Prosecutor from Belgrade to New York as he tries to pressure the governments concerned to break the streets around the escaped crime.
What kind of insurance is it for me?
The vehicle insurance, which represents security of the owner of the vehicle, is a significant expenditure against the various damages and depends on several factors, such as the date of the acquisition of the vehicle, the date of the permit, the family status, the type of vehicle in question and the nature of the use of the vehicle in question.
The purchase of the car is only the first step.
It's really much easier to choose the right insurance than to decide which car we want.
First of all, we need to be clear about what it is.
Vehicle insurance shall be provided by the insurance company and by an agreement between the insurance undertaking.
This agreement killed a body in the form of an insurance contract which states that the insurance company is liable for damages in the event of injury.
The amount paid in respect of insurance shall be in practice fixed by different factors, such as the date of the acquisition of the right, the family status, the type of car insurer, its use and others.
The insurance policies are based on statistics on the insurance premium, i.e. a higher amount is paid by those who represent the highest risk.
That's why women over 25 years of age or less pay because statistics say they're less likely to risk because they're more careful.
Similarly, on the basis of the evidence, insurance companies have concluded that those living in a marriage are less likely to cause harm than are private people.
The frequency of use of the car is the decision.
The possibility of an accident increases with more often use.
When the insurance fee is fixed, the insurance companies take into account a number of factors.
Therefore, the owner must look closely after his or her ability to choose the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
In the following, we present the most important factors in the selection to make the best use of the guaranteed requirements and to create an acceptable price.
When the insurance contract is concluded, it must be calculated on a number of basis within 25 years, such as the lack of leadership experience and the lack of legality.
Although most legitimate, if we are safe from all risks, there are even more economic solutions.
Precautious drivers may be required to provide full insurance, thus avoiding all risks and the price will be payable.
In such a contract, the secured payment is part of the damage.
"The amount of self-sustainment paid by the insured person depends on the insurance fee; the higher the fee, the lower the self-sustainment," says Luis Noguera, the Spanish director of First Europe’s internet insurance intermediaries.
Another option is increased liability insurance for third parties when the client provides himself with the damage caused by others, but not the damage caused by his own car.
In addition, it will be secured against theft, fire and car damage.
A good council.
If you are not 25 years old, be careful and you may be able to avoid the risks because this has an impact on the bonus and you can thus reduce the amount you pay in the future.
Bonus shall be named after the benefits granted under the basic principle of the insurance company.
And we call the punishment that's meant for the basics.
"The size of the bonus and the fine depends on the insurance company and its profit.
If the company has been a good year, you can let yourself figure out what the bonus is" explains Noguera.
If the 25-year-old age has already passed, the owners will be able to make it easier to provide adequate insurance because the risk is reduced by the experience they have gained over the years.
Then we recommend that they take full insurance with themselves.
"In general, young people are not able to apply their experience in one disaster or even when they are driving," says the Director of the European Insurance Society of Spain, adding that most of the accidents result in the second year of driving when leaders have already crossed the minds of beginners.
If the insured person is already a woman, but there are no children, the best if he has full insurance, of course, if his financial options allow this.
Insurance companies hold children married couples at the lowest risk for clients, and therefore the payment fee is also lower in their case.
In this case, the best of full-time insurance (which is available at EUR 300) or if they have a higher bonus, the insurance may be extended from the third year of the vehicle to the injury caused by the other.
"They drive more slowly, but they're more their buyers and allow themselves to be more self-esteem," confirms Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, we offer full insurance willingly (about EUR 150), or in the case of a higher bonus, it can be extended to liability insurance.
Vehicle insurance is very important, not only because it represents protection in the event of damage to the owner, but also because it is a major expenditure, so it is not possible to choose the insurance form that has been paid to the person.
Celtic wants to get a point in Milan to get into the eight.
Milan and Celtic both measure their strength at San Siro Stadium to get the missing point when they close the Bajonok League. The Italians can be the first to do this and the Scots can qualify for themselves.
The Italians have all ten points and have already provided the transmission in the fifth round with no decision taken by a Portuguese, however, Celtic has nine points, but one more should be for the six-point Shakhtar, who will then fight the four-point Benfia, not forward.
The D group will hold two matches a week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan has to play in Japan at the Club World Cup, where at the 13th, he tries to appeal to decision 16.
This D group will soon close as the others, and even though the most likely outcome in Giuseppe Meazza stadium will be decisive, the two teams will win because the Italians don't want to stay home, and Celtic can start at the top of the eightth floor.
Gordon Strachan's team even has enough to qualify if Shakhtar does not win, but cannot be sure, because if there is accuracy, the Ukrainians will continue to reach those lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but won the next series (2-0).
The Italians will then be able to slow down the night of the Scots who want to join the eight-year-old Bajnokok League once again, after having received an extension from the Kaka in the next year (1-0).
The victory of "Rossonerik" would be most happy if Shakhtar lost Celtic to the eight-year-old and stayed in UEFA.
As Benfia, despite being in the last place and not having the opportunity to stay in the European Union, can still get the third place with a win that could be played in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to take part in the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour.
Spice Girls started his tour in Vancouver, Canada, and they've been up for 20,000 years now since they were released in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Hallwell) announced a few minutes before the concert organized in the Vancouver GM Place that the joint "reme" is in shape.
About 20,000 people have changed their notes to be there at the concert, where a video show has also been shown on the history of the great achievements of the 1990s.
With a joint recomposition and a new album together with the tournament, the EMI has also been placed on the market in Spain, which includes the largest strikers and two new waves of "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Spice Girls is five members of the Pash Spice's husband, the British Foscist David Beckham, who took a lead in his career.
The athlete was also there at the sight of GM Place, although Victoria had been arrested a few days earlier.
When the show was due, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "I haven't seen our playing clothes yet, so I'm angry about what you're thinking about the show".
'Sporty Spice' was the reason that the joint split up two years after she left the band in 1998 'because the members didn't understand each other' she also appeared strange during the press release, which was held two hours before the concert.
"I've never been.
I was angry, but I saw people's feelings about Spice Girls changed.
I thought why not? Now I'm glad I made this decision," Chisholm said about the co-operation that led him up nine years ago.
The singer also added that in time "the things started to happen and we love each other very much."
But a lot of things have changed since Spice Girls' last move in 1998.
According to CTV television reports, Virginia Airlines specifically arrived in Vancouver.
A group of baby-sitters were waiting for them at the airport.
They've all got seven kids.
After the Vancouver concert, the team was formed in California (USA), then in San José (December 4) and in Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
Our move will take place in Madrid on 23 December.
Other fears about Russian gas emissions
The gas price between Ukraine and Russia has increased, which can also affect Russian fuel transport to North Europe.
The large part of Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is being transferred through Ukraine and the discussions between the two countries are always taking great note.
Kjev said that if Moscow is to raise greenhouse gas prices by Ukraine, they will also have a higher transit cost for Russia.
One, generally between the two countries, as a result of the previous debate, has been reduced by the accession of the EU countries.
The most recent dispute between the Ukrainian Government and the Russian state-owned gas monopolium in Kiev and Moscow is related to the Gasprom's experiment with the agreement on the gas price paid by Russia by Ukraine in 2008.
Gazprom stated that 50 % of the greenhouse gas emissions from neighboring Turkmenistan should be implemented in respect of the IP with Ukraine in 2008.
According to the analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of the shipment from Gazprom to Ukraine.
"It is important for us to consider during the negotiations in accordance with one of the most important transit countries of gas transport," said Anatolyj Kinah, Minister of Economic Affairs of Reuters.
"The gas-related changes should be combined in any way with the discussions on the scale of the costs of the transitions to Ukraine (and in Western Europe)."
As a result of the most significant gas price difference between Moscow and Kiev, the gas pipeline led by Gazprom in Ukraine was closed in January 2006.
This has resulted in a fall in the volume of exports to North-European countries, which has significantly increased prices.
The European Union's single gas supply is made up of Russian gas.
Russia has the world's largest greenhouse gas stocks, but most of them are still undisputed.
As a result, the gas supply of Gazprom itself from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian countries is totalled by land gas from Sweden.
NHS "to control foreign workers"
The Committees of the Scotch NHS should improve the monitoring of the criminal record of workers from outside Europe - a supervisory body has stated.
The proposal was presented by Mr Black after a foreign citizen doctor in Scotland was brought into contact with the attack on the Glagow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of seafarers.
At the same time, the report also highlighted key checks carried out by five health authorities, which were properly carried out.
Following an attack on the Glagow airport, the chief auditor verified the list of unmanned applications outside the European Economic Area.
The 28-year-old Bilal Abdullahot, who is located in Paisley, was subsequently detained by a Iraqi native doctor at the airport for his release from the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of the three doctors who were heard by the Old Bailey court in October in case of motor vehicle bombings in the United Kingdom.
In the case of NHS committees coming from coastal countries, they must verify before entering into employment the skills and work experience of the workers concerned and the availability of the permits necessary for the recruitment of workers in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Committees use Disclosure Scotland for the control of criminal registration, the Agency did not have the right to purchase such significant information from outside Britain.
The main report suggested that the Commission should introduce a guide to the Criminal Reporting Office, which facilitates the monitoring procedures with different coastal countries for the employer.
"Even though we have found evidence of such checks among the records from staff, they are not being carried out regularly," says the report.
According to Black, the Skot NHS carries out its own pre-employment review procedure at such a high level as "Our report selects the developmental areas of the system in order to provide updated information on the number of NHS personnel from the coastal area".
Dr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said that "extraordinaryly unlikely", we could identify potential NHS users who might be pursuing terrorist activities in the future by means of pre-employment checks.
"The report says that pre-employment checks currently applied are working well in the NHS Scotland, and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent," he added.
According to health authorities, the current number of seafarers present in most of them is 1161.
However, the auditor pointed out that numbers are likely to be higher, which in part may explain that the Commission's problem is due to the identification of applications for unlimited time.
The investigation also showed that the checks carried out in the Airshire and Arran areas, in Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde areas, in Lanarkshire and in the NHS authorities in Lothanian are in great cooperation.
These procedures have been extended to the verification of the licence, the employment permit, and the documents that justify professional training.
The Scots Government is currently examining the directive and the guide for checks on the use of NHS users from overseas countries.
Nicola Sturgeon, a health secretary, said: "It was very pleased that this mission was carried out after the attack on the Glagow airport.
He added that the Scottish Government - in cooperation with the Health Committees - will take into account the proposals contained in the report and will ensure that the full-time guard - including the seafarers - will review the best practice of the day-to-day pre-employment checks. The updated amendment will be published in the next month.
Joy Division's filming the diocese.
From Joy Division's bipic, from Ian Curtis, "Control", five prizes were awarded to the British Independent Film Department - among other things the prize for the best film.
He also received a loan from the director-in-chief, Sam Riley, who worked in a factory before the construction of Curtis, as well as Anton Corbín's manager and Toby Kebell's assistant.
The award for the best dancer was made by Dame Judi Dench with the "A Botanical Details" thriller.
And the Variety Award - to put the British film into the international showcase - was taken by Daniel Craig, founder of Bondot.
The fees were divided into a celebration held in the London Roundhouse.
The film "Control" shows the rise of Curtis in the Joy Division neighborhoods all over 1980 when he committed suicide at the age of 23.
The "The Killers", David Bowie, and the "New Order on the Soundtrack" are all three million pieces of black and white film.
The Dutch photo, Corbin, which was previously known as the production of the U2 "Joshua Tree" album, was also awarded two other prizes; with the best organizer and the best starter.
Another reward for the rock was placed in the centre; Julien Temple Joe Strummer, a film about Clash's song, took away the award for the best documentary.
The best award for the film was Viggo Mortensen, organized by David Cronenberg, a triller who played in London, for the construction of his "Gylic Promises" mafia career.
Rey Winstone, who was known for his heavy role in contributing to the British film industry, was part of Richard Harris' prize.
The five-year-old film named "Scum", "Ehcopon" and "Sexi" are also featured in the film "The Kingdom of Indiana Jones and the Christian Church".
Winstone is proud to be able to take over the "Camelot" and "Harry Potter" lost star in 2002 named Harris.
"For people like me, people like me have opened their eyes like Richard Harris and Albert Finney," he added to Winston.
"I really feel lucky I could meet Richard Harris more than once.
Richard Harris' style is close to me, it was an old great color and I really appreciate him."
A group of filmmakers, dancers and festival organizers decided to select independent filmmakers known as Bifa.
The role of Bifa's supporters and patrons is, for example, Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Ngyy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbotto.
208 people were arrested in Saudi Arabia in connection with a terrorist conspiracy
Earlier in Saudi Arabia, he announced that 208 terrorists were detained in concentration camps who planned to attack an oil plant and to force more church personnel and security forces.
According to the state television of the world's largest oil exporter, one of the seals wanted to pass over rockets.
Al-Kaida's support was launched against the monarchy, which has been active as the United States' allies since the 2003 Iraqi invasion.
According to television research, eight main stations led by a foreign state-owned population are to launch an attack on an oil plant.
After an attack by Al-Qaida, the world's largest oil treatment facility in Abqaiq in 2006, Saudi Arabia launched a 35,000 major rapid response effort to protect its facilities.
According to the Deputy Minister's report, 18 of the detainees belong to a prison that is led by a "specialised person" who is illegally passing the country.
The report also stated that the warlords were trying to smuggle eight shots into the realm of the kingdom.
There were plans to follow up attacks against church leaders and security forces on 22 of them.
The government has called on church leaders to step up the strike of Saudis belonging to Al-Kaida-harcos in Iraq who are fighting against the Muslim government of the United States of America and are also considered to be cruel Soviet allies.
Al-Kaida's wars are considered to be an important part of the Saudi-Arab church leaders as the authorities have taken part in the support of the government's royal family policy.
The organisation's wars - inspired by its leader, Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, aimed at attacking foreign housing facilities, government buildings and energy-intensive facilities for the purposes of the Saudi government.
"The security forces have made powerful efforts in the past five months," said a government television director from the Ministry of the Interior.
During the arrests in Medina, a 16-year-old "media support" was also taken, which was aimed at spreading "takfiri thought". Takfiri thought is the ideology of the Sunnita Muslim radicals, which supports a strong action against the unchallenged and trusted Muslims.
The arrests included 32 persons who were accused of financial support from the military.
Russia's climate can be seen in the future of Earth
According to the scientists' findings yesterday, Vänus was once able to provide suitable living conditions.
A European orbiting planet's data suggests that this planet is much more likely to be considered as Earth's mass cycle than we once thought.
The war is the next planetary debate on Earth.
The size of the two bourgeois was similar to that of their circuits, although Venus is a little closer to Naphos.
According to scientists today, billions of years ago, life conditions in Venus could have been very similar to those in the Earth and even the living cells could have been given.
However, because of the high greenhouse gas emissions, the warming caused atmospheric erosion and a lower speed of movement in the planet, Vénus was exposed to a different developmental demand in a mine.
Water has already been pumped from the balloon, its high temperature is sufficiently sourced for the reading of the cloud, and powerful waves and lightning waves are destroyed.
The conclusions of the European Agency’s Venus Express climate crisis - based on a study by the planet for a year - draw an excellent picture of how disaster climate change can occur in the Earth.
Fred Taylor, professor of Oxford University of physics, who is one of the leaders of Venus Express's mission, told the following: "Initiate that Venus's climate is so great that the Earth's experience is very similar to that of two other planets.
"With the help of our new data, it has become possible to produce a driving book on the development of Venus billions of years ago when it was still available under conditions similar to Earth.
Police seized from "dung gold"
A kilo of radioactive material, according to reports, was taken from the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
According to one police officer, three persons were arrested and the substance was also subjected to investigation.
The speaker did not confirm whether it was about the gifted gold, but stated that it could be delivered for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Tear open
Because Romney doesn't think it's appropriate to mark a presidential election to answer questions from a human being.
The presidential election's republical signs were also included in a discussion on YouTube, which included questions for the weekly voters and forwarded them to the candidates.
On Friday evening, 28 November, none of the questions raised in the evening were as convincing as the woman who asked the Democrats about global rise in the debate on the other party's YouTube.
However, the questions and answers took this time well into account the situation of the Republican party close to the next year's election.
Firstly, it was not known that CNN's manufacturers for the co-financing of the dispute were chosen on the basis of what was the basis of the YouTube clips distributed to the brands.
The first half hour of the debate was the shortest question of immigration.
This issue is one of the root of the Republicans.
The CNN raised a number of unconfirmed votes that if there is a delay in the number, a number will be discussed: the mediation agreement was experienced when the signatories were difficult to express on the issue of borders.
The most recent and most recent debate took place between Rudy Giuliani, who lived at the national level, and Romney, who took the lead in the decisive elections held in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the picture he has come out of, which says he has been too easy to deal with the issue of illegal immigration under the new York citizenship.
He accused Romney of taking up illegal immigrants from the former government of Massachusetts to build the house.
The communication between the two of them became particularly difficult when the questionnaires were interested in the support of the "Amnesty" (which would ensure the possibility of permanent status and citizenship for illegal immigrants).
Some of the least-voting figures - such as Duncan Hunter, California, and Tom Tancredo -- have been able to focus their attention on the topic.
And although none of us can count on the possibility of staying in the competition, it may be explained that they began to talk to others about the noise of migration.
At least there is broad agreement on immigration: strengthening the common objective of borders and a difficult step towards illegal immigrants.
This theme - whether the fear of Chinese gambling and other relief factors coming from the world - will help the Republicans in the neighborhood to get involved in or minimize their share between liberals and Christian conservatives.
However, when other significant issues came up, the debate was quite unhesitating.
Giulian had to consider why he had previously supported arms control.
John McCain and Romney discussed the question of whether the simulated water incineration should be considered.
Another question was whether the signers believed all the words of the Bible.
At the conclusion of this question, Giuliani was able to reason in this regard that although he considered the Bible to be a book of interest, Jonah’s and the account may not be as meaningful as he thought it would be.
Another question arose as to whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who was the first to take the stand on the stand-alone iowa election, who was able to thank Christian conservativeism for victory, responded with expectations that the death penalty would be painful, but he needed it.
When asked if Jesus would receive sufficient support, he said so much that Jesus would give more wisdom than to go to the choices.
The competition continues to open out of practice.
Huckabee's generous stay in iowa is connected with the liberal Ron Paul's money-gathering action and the heartbreaking life of the Serbian debate.
The immediate prevention of the two signs can be explained by the fact that the two sources of the party have not yet been able to initiate a common signal among the more well-known and traditional aspirins.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a sign that brought together the party, which in time and convincingly fought the victory message that proclaimed America's greatness and which found the party with both sources.
Now, however, the party has divided and its consequences are invisible.
Work-related pain
Other steps are taken before Gordon Brown; the lead route is unchanged
The British political botanists don't seem to be too picky right now.
No one has given his credit, no politicians have come forward from Paris's hotel accounts, no one has followed a box outside of marriage.
However, the discovery that a wealthy businessman over four years in the name of others has gone to the United Kingdom, with a total of more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars), and that the party has not made a report on this party, one of the things that would have been good without the surrounding Gordon Brown.
Two months ago when the Prime Minister cut the election and when he said - according to the opinion-research didn't influence the outcome of the decision - he questioned the ability of the British to understand, people were still hoping that Brown would ensure a strong and effective government.
Instead, as Vince Cable pointed out, the leader of liberal Democrats, who was once created by Mr. Bean from Brown Stalin, was becoming more and more influential.
The Bank of Northern Rock, which was responsible for the rescue of the Bank, placed regulatory weaknesses and lack of capacity in the judiciary.
The proposals for changing the tax law encouraged business interest groups to agree with the government.
In terms of 25 million people's personal data, the loss of tax authority has inevitably resulted in a major public deficit.
In the House of Lordok, three state-of-the-art troops who were opposed to the reduction in the budget of the army announced that the position of the Ministry of Defence was part of the occupation.
And now there are David Abraham's secret gifts; Peter Watt, head of the Labour Party (former administrative director).
These accidents don't mean that Brown can't turn back on the way to the exit.
At the same time, governments can access the point after which direction may be impossible.
People don't like politicians and don't trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually depend on their mistrust.
However, as it becomes clear that the Prime Minister is unlikely to be able to speed things up, and perhaps not to stay in his post for a long time, the long-term uncertainty is over: the need for public officials to step up, the cabinet ministers will join, the media will look at bad news; and the government will begin to protect and be unable to concentrate.
In a sense, Brown is in particular in a difficult situation because he does not consider "fresh blood" in contrast with other political leaders.
No matter how much he wanted to break up with Tony Blaire, it was still his right hand.
For example, the problems related to Northern Rock and the tax notes are related to decisions taken during the Brown Ministry of Finance.
And although Blair-like comments - for example, the investigation into the relationship between the "monetary minority" case and the political co-financing - did not directly take part, voters may rule against it by law.
Even though Brown's situation is extremely unpleasant, it's not as bad as it looks.
The aftershocks aren't as destructive as they appear to be.
Unless Mr. Bean died, no one was killed, no one was taken directly.
And the torture can continue with pain, even though it is still possible to create directions for the Brown Stalins: reliable, stable and slightly difficult governance.
You serve as a good example in the area of political donation.
A prominent man named Abraham, who likens his gift to a gift of blessing, stated that he did not want it to be given to the public.
It may be so, however, that the decision was not part of his influence.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of major political supporters is clear and clear: the population has the right to know who is responsible for the country's leadership.
Watt, who, according to his own account, knew about Abraham's action, was not clear with his illegal nature, but he will certainly be recognized during the hearings, even though Jon Medleson, the Founder of the Labour Party, who was informed in October about the corrupt donations.
However, first of all, they don't lead the streets: there's nothing wrong with knowing about these charges, not even the fact that they were sent to Brown's office after his departure to June office.
He has so far fulfilled his duties as the Prime Minister.
The legal damage suffered by the party in the same period, however, has increased its stability as a well-known measure; the investigation of the case, for the sake of security, has entrusted a relief committee and a judge's board of directors.
In this case the "learning lesson" isn't too complicated.
In case of irregularity, the police are competent.
In addition, Brown has to take other matters into account, such as the invitation of the President of the Independent Committee on the Rules of Administration to work in such a six-month period, or the expeditious reform of the political co-financing.
This would require hard work from the hard work force to cooperate with the bullies and break up with special financial relations with the communities - this would be a difficult challenge for Brown.
But I need you to look at some of the facts related to the party.
According to studies, conservatives are currently taking a serious advantage; Brown has two years to return the votes behind him; the only way to overcome the victory is to avoid inadmissibility and strong competence.

Does the second market credit crisis threaten the US credit card market?
If blood gets into the water, it's natural that capes are coming close.
Now that the U.S. housing market is weakened, farmers are focusing on the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs’ analysts believe that if the crisis of credit affects other forms of population credit, the credit card’s market losses can reach even $99 billion.
The signs of disorder can be clearly seen.
It has increased the rate of payment of all outstanding loans and the rate of fraud over 30 days.
HSBC reported $1.4 billion losses last month in the U.S. consumption funding segment, partly due to the financial weaknesses of card owners.
At the same time, the panic is still early.
The share of the descriptions and late payments remains low.
The 389% late payment rate calculated by Moody's credit rating institution for the third quarter is lower than a whole percentage point in the historical average.
The reduction of rates can be explained by technical factors.
The changes in the U.S. rules of non-payment in 2005 resulted in a sudden reduction in the number of applicants for non-payments, while a significant loss on the market for credit cards; the number of claims (and this description) is expected to increase again, regardless of whether or not all of the terms of credit-taking are correct.
The rate of payment, which shows the share of the monthly credit loss of consumers, is high on the market.
In addition, confidence in securities covered by its credit card is strong despite the fact that structural funding has emerged in other areas.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup research company is estimated to be 25% higher in the 2007 release volume than in the ceiling.
The impact of the signatory market crisis on the credit card market is clear: consumers are preparing debt on credit cards for the destruction of housing facilities.
At the same time, card issuers are primarily concerned with money-laundering and not with the value of the assets, so housing does not necessarily result in a change in credit ability of creditors.
For creditors, the situation may even be beneficial.
If the property is less than the credit value, the incentives for consumers to lose credit are reduced; as a result, the repayment of debt on credit cards will advance in the priority range.
By changing the thresholds or credit limits, card issuers may be able to apply the changing conditions more quickly and more flexibility to signatories.
This should significantly reduce the risk of immediate recovery of tools.
"It is unlikely that one day we will wake up to fully appreciate the faith," says Gary Perlin, the financial director of Capital One.
If an emergency emergency subprime crisis is less likely on the credit card market, the risk of a growing return is much higher.
If the reduced prices of the housing market and the return of credit are being reduced to the recession of America, the industry will undoubtedly look forward to the future.
It's interesting to try those rapists.
British bankers accused themselves of committing crimes in the Enron case
Sherdan admitted his crime to the three British bankers who were represented by the former Financial Director of Enron, Andrew Faston, to the court to investigate their role in the fire department.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were first told that they were innocent in the case of a week-old family, which, according to condition, worked with Fastow in a secret marriage that was followed in 2000, where they wanted to earn the wages of their employees.
Their negotiations began in January.
But in a court hearing, the U.S. District Court, Ewing Werlein Jr., all of them recognized the crime committed in court.
The Royal Bank of Scotland Group of Greenwich NatWest uses three earlier applications in Great Britain under the two-year tender procedure.
The conclusion of the investigation of the case initiated following Enron’s 2001 summary is still expected in the United States.
In 2002 he warned Fastow against their first complaint that he was one of the objectives of the government investigation initiated to determine the time of Enron.
According to the charge against "NatWest Third" three bloggers traveled to Houston in 2000 in order to prepare the family with Fastow and Fastow Akori's best hand.
Fastow, responsible for the design of the numerous damages to Enront’s arm, also included the Enron subsidiary, which was invested by Greenwich NatWest.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of the shareholding of the subsidiary, but three British men well knew that the interest was well worth it.
A company managed by a Kopper purchased the bank’s share of $1 million in its subsidiary.
The bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper so they could have a share in this company.
According to the case, Fastow recently informed Enront that the energy company would buy 20 million dollars from Greenwich NatWest for its subsidiary.
But in fact, 20 million dollars went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The charge is that the bankers were 7.3 million while Fastow, Kopper and the others were $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow admitted his double crime because of his role in Enron's composition.
The British were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently sentenced to six years in a state federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper spent three years and a month in a texarkana prison.
Three English men were able to travel to the United States, where they stayed for a time.
Enron, the largest American company ever reported in December 2001, was unable to continue to avoid the millions of deaths or losses incurred by the beneficiary after years of use.
As a result of this merger, the market value decreased by more than $60 billion, while pensions by more than $2 billion fell.
Kenneth Lay, the founder of Enron and former director of the company, Jeffrey Skilling were generally convicted of their crime committed in the company's yard.
Skilling is currently in prison for more than 24 years.
All the charges against Lay were dropped by the man's death last year.
No Poverty in Moscow
54 million dollars begins with a golfstream G550 equipped with Rolls-Royce engine, which makes a tank with no break between Moscow and Los Angeles.
But this amount only counts for some Russian rich people.
"18-way man in it," said Dan Firer, representative of the Gulfstream.
"No one shall make such a appointment, because the machines are purchased for private families or business managers."
Mr. Firer calculated to the visitors the four-day, exclusive, Milliomos in Vásar, which was arranged in the powerful exhibition halls around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury items were placed on the show, hoping that the Russians would be interested in all of the Russian news from the mahogany bourgeois jacket with the diamond, 50 cents of heat heaters.
As Mr. Firer looked around, he noticed Porsche, a bright orange lighted up next to him.
"A nice car, but it's not worth the pressure of our products," he said.
"The largest market in Russia after the United States of America is private aircraft."
It looks like the Russian capital spends as much money as Dallas did at the time of the oil spill.
"We went through the same process in the 1890s when some American million people went to Europe. These Americans were considered to be the material here," said Marshall Goldman, the sponsorship of the Russian and European Studies Center of Davis.
Like the success of the 1970s in Saudi Arabia and Japan in the 1990s, the Russians are now becoming the world’s most popular gamblers.
The most common luxury brands are derived from orange juice.
At another Moscow-based conference organized by the Luxusipar, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, President LVMH shared its opinion on how to sell high-value products in markets similar to Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribunal, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes, a list of the most affordable people is 53 billion lives in Russia, with a total of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the number of Russian millionaires in the second half of the world has reached 103, which can total $670 billion, has been established by a study by the administrations of the Economic and Monetary Research Centre in the area of the former Soviet Union.
(On the basis of World Bank data, in 2005 there were 15.8 percent of the population living below the baseline in Russia.)
"More than a hundred million lives in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, London's experienced sales and marketing representative David Morris.
Nicole took part in the purchase with the Russian merchant of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group-pal.
"All women are inexhaustible, and men are meant to be real prostitutes."
In the production on Sunday night of the night's dress, two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, both owned millions of customers.
"I've seen cars and I've been trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Yumatova, a young man who was suddenly dressed in a special design suit, as if he had already contributed to this move.
The purchase was first arranged for the new owners, for those market-oriented Russian buyers who were willing to travel to a quiet, digitally damaged place after several hours in the market, where they can once find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pockets, Mölenpick ice cream, ordinary billiard tables, Dubai apartments and Gund Plus maces.
For the average people, the revenue is EUR 30 ($44.57).
"The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who took a place from home at the Dutch porcelain producer's Royal Delft's station, facing a farm, hand-dryed, white-haired Rembrandt.
"The Russians are of course more interested in the things that appear."
In fact, the sellers here said that the long (based on Russian standards this is 10-15 years old) rich Russians have already been separated from the open logs to markets which are not marketed in a limited number of cases.
Still, thousands of people, including millions of people, millions of people, trusted and visited the area every day.
And some of them were bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershaw, the director of King Koil's bedmaker, told him, on the same day, two, seven thousand dollars each, made of silk, cassmium and cotton, with gold mine.
On the first night of the company's first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, an A1 Moto salesman involved in the modern supply of high-quality cars, sold Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170 billion.
Andrei Karapetian, a luxury car manufacturer who delivers solutions to specific needs, L.A. Connection President sold three hothouses on Sunday to Rolls-Royce Phantom. The breeds are compared to tied chain doors and go into $55,000 each.
The reporters also showed up for a Russian casino owner who, according to the Swarovski Christians, offered to make a routine appearance of a cross.
A four-pound price: $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who'd like to take a picture of a circus photo of his wife's face from the skin and her face, will not necessarily use these articles," Karapetian said.
"The place of 30-40 cars will protect them in a garage."
Despite the fact that many Russian customers are rich, according to Karapetian, the "Russian million" term today does not mean a great deal, but rather an early increase in domestic property.
"The one who bought property in Moscow four or five years ago, he said, is already millions of people today, although not in money, but at least in paper."
"There's more to them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires, at least they could have seen the economy before the establishment of the Russian company Alliance Continental.
The company has built four, English-style telephone sites that have been destroyed with millions of dollars of fake banks.
That Karryev, the company told the marketing manager, the team printed 500 thousand pieces of fake bank notes for the Million Moose.
Many of those visitors were tempted to play with the money. Many photos were produced on their cell phone as they were tied in with money, or they were just making a few million pieces of silver.
"You see, all millions of people in Moscow can feel themselves," said Karryev.
They're suspecting of a cebesthetic surgery after a murder in New Jersey.
The day before the show, it happened that Ronald Livingston looked at my restaurant called "Just in a Little Better Health" and saw it as a truck stopped at Cape Cod on two doors at West Scott Avenue.
Not long later a police officer arrived.
Then another one.
"And then I saw him as his doctor's car stopped," said Lord Livingston, one of the supervisors working in my restaurant on Saturday.
"Then I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found out that the dead woman was 41 years old, named Olga Arroyo. She used to work as an assistant to the director of the network police.
The investigation is currently under way to find out whether one of the deaths of West Scott Avenue, who works without a permit under 212, caused an intervention by an unidentified cosmetic infection by the police.
The authorities have not so far been able to determine why Arroya died, but they hope that a few weeks after the test of toxicology will lead to this mysterious death which has affected the high number of nurses in the network.
Arroyo, whose voice was widely known in the department, has worked as an assistant officer since September 2006, with Gary F. McCarthy.
"He was loyal, humble and reliable," he said about McCarthy Arroyo in a cell phone interview.
". He was my maid.
He was my protector."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was a former Newark police officer, currently a wife of Jimmy Arroyo, who worked on the Swiss Products Control Committee, and two, a 14-year-old and a 11-year-old boy, and a musta girl after you.
Mr. Eileen Walsh, the Union's attorney, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the investigators were working on finding that Mrs. Arroyo was a victim of an unauthorized infection.
"The probability is great," said Walsh.
"The investigation is still going on."
The authorities report that they arrived there about 3 o'clock in the afternoon at the house on November
At 21st and Arroyo were found on the couch.
They've already been declared dead in the scene.
More than a week ago, the police had paid very little attention to the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't tell me if the detectives had heard of Castro.
In the study, participants are investigating whether part of the house has worked as a medical director.
No one opened the door at Castro's home, where he was standing in the front of the basement and ran out of the house.
To the leading door in the pen, the car door was opened with a white label "Etil Vanilin" used to replace Vanilla in meals and perfumes.
Turned from the camp into two mountain bikes.
McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark 25 years after his first visit to Newark with the New York police, Ms. Arroyo announced invaluable assistance to him by helping him join his new city's unconventional and unconstitutional political culture.
"He always said, 'It's better to take care of it and it's better than that."
"He was always here when I came in the morning, and he was still inside when I woke up at night.
It was a mess."
Hopes for the Fed Stockpiling of the World’s Share Markets lead to the destruction of the world’s share markets
On both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, the participants were shaken yesterday, after their statements of satisfaction from the presidential position of the Central Bank of America increased their hopes that Fed would need to facilitate further investment opportunities.
The participation markets in both London, New York and Europe were established following the fact that Donald Kohn, who said that President Ben Bernande had better hands, had to respond "slowly and pragmaticly" to the constant concern of financial markets.
In addition to the clear objective of Kohn’s rehabilitating the markets, he stated that the current instability "partly reversed the development of the market in late September and October".
He said that if the increased stress continues to persist, it could increase the possibility of further distortions of credit conditions for households and companies.
The investors explained that Fed is ready to inject fresh capital to the US markets or even further tax reductions in credit terms.
The announcements also affected Wall Street, which has received some bad news about the US economy. For example, it was also a negative record of the number of American residents.
The financial imbalance was also confirmed by the report by the Bear Stearns Investment Bank, which covers 4 percent of the total expenditure incurred by the US secondary-market housing sector, as part of the reduction of the budget, and 4 percent of the global labour force.
A total of 20 jobs in London, where 1500 employees are employed, are covered by the above measure.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry averaged 331 points, increased by 2.55 percent and closed at 13.289.40 points, while the larger S&P 500 index was increased by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index 165.5 points, increased by 2.7 percent and closed at 6.306.2 and thus produced the value of British blue-ship companies with more than 39 fonts.
The German Dax grew by 2.6 percent while the French CAC40 grew by 2.3 percent.
The credit market deficit was renewed after the large demand auction organized by the European Central Bank for securities that had not been seen since April 2001, reached a peak of 4.7 percent price for European banks.
Following the fall of the English central bank, Libor achieved the highest values seen since September, 6,59 percent, the Bank of England has made it difficult for him to follow the Fed and the ECB, and he has also allowed the London financial market to finance him.
The decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara is followed in England
He gave two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who'd the English team be six months in Candy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in relation to the first test against Sri Lanka, who's at least important to make the decision?
The last question is part of this because David Graveney, president of the electors, who is temporarily carrying out this particular task, is helping the head coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan in the decision. On the other hand, because the Chief Executive Director of the English Office, Hugh Morris, is beginning to make requests for a national or at least one electoral post.
Of the two players, it attracts the shorter one, which does not get the sixth rowing place, but as it is known, life, and mainly sports is often unfair.
It's never easy to tell how you feel about someone's reputation, while another can't go beyond a lower level, much less luck than it's possible.
It is not just a cricket that makes it difficult to choose from - a lot of subjective.
Is it time for Bopara to make progress?
Is it fair to look at Shah if this happens?
The same question can also be asked in other areas of life, for example, when we say John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, with two clear, excellent performances, would set the business up for the decision-makers, while only one of them has a place.
Who can tell which level of a cricket without being thrown into deep water in a more serious competition?
Of course, data have a major impact on decision-making, but the same is also important.
In a group, the player must get the captain's attention at the right time in the cricket gate, and a runner must get a regular chance if he wants to become a big player once.
It's much more complicated to take the view of the voters.
For example, James Anderson was better played in the last season, he still certainly counted the team in the first test, despite Stephen Harmison's being in good shape and going very well for him.
Anderson fought his participation in the tournament with his first class head down and 33 runs.
Chris Tremlett just hit 29, but both of them were already the most successful moments at the highest level, and hope they'll be in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiria Stadium, this will be rejected on the basis of their opinions.
This decision may reflect or destroy any career, but it may also have no special effect on the future.
Four years ago, Sri Lankan Garreth Batty played all the same test and was well accomplished with five chapters and 40 useful rides, yet Paul Collingwood, who was in the acrey, was the one who became an outstanding and determined test critic, who may still be underestimated despite having obtained a double percentage point against Australia.
It is likely that when you listen to the conservative experiences of Graveney, Vaughan and Moores in Asgiria Stanion, you will gain greater experience with your voice, your youth's life and your dynamics.
I think they're talking to both of them.
She told Shah about her bright and successful debut of the 88th Bombay test. Her seven-year-old, 22-year-old Bopara, who also appeared on the sidewalks, was 32th-century.
But the fact that middlesex player Shah at home in May, in the Lord's ordered test against the West Indies was only ten in the four of you, and that the fighter Vaughan, who fought against the voters in the next game, seemed to have reduced its appeal, which was still clearly seen in Bombay.
In contrast, Essex's universal ability is a life-threatening and unsurpassed player.
Nothing can be done on the cricket floor, but it was well marked when an exhibition opened up to the team's car sponsor, Volkswagen, with a four-wheeler.
Despite this, the last thing he did after he took his (naturally sponsored) Vadaphone phone and called his remote teammate, Alasterir Cook, to ask him, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is a better player with classics. He produces a good booster for his broken middle steps, and his trips are self-insurance and business.
The choice of the right person is one thing and another is the right moment.
Maybe this is the right art of selection.
I think I'd give Bopara a chance now, which doesn't mean that I don't think Shah's giving high time if -- as the celebrity plays, he'd be the one who's playing at the end of the week.
Buses transport the passengers home to work and take up the fight with Al-Kaida
Since yesterday, the first bus from Syria to Baghdad with the Iraqis who have taken their money or lost their visas or with the opportunity of those who hope to return the order to the city.
There are also those who have gone back to fight with the soldiers who have driven them out of their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already full of 800 people from Syria and Jordan who arrived from a Damascus busloaded several thousand buses and government conjuvants.
"Then I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a doctor.
"Today I went back because I saw what happened in Baghdad on TV and in the news and that the city is now safe.
"It is said that Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he added, following Moqtada al-Sadr's military campaign, which currently stopped his army.
The 38-year-old teacher from Amariyah, who lived in the outback, Qassim al Atwani took two children home because he was unable to update his heart vision and because the Dutch race prevented the Iraqis from doing business.
Amariya’s neighbors called him and rushed home, saying that with the help of American support teams, Al-Qaida was able to escape from their village of Al-Qaida in the rest of the capital.
One of the first to come from Jordan was a sultan and cruel tribal leader who left his home in the north-banded village of Sleikh after fighting against Al-Kaida.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago my friends called and said they had created an anti-Al-Kaida militia in Sleikh, and they needed my support and my sons.
That's why I came back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many talked about the fact that since the formation of American teams in the capital, peace has been strengthened and armed civil forces working with the United States have forced them home.
But they were even more forced to leave Damascus because of visa-related and material concerns.
The 51-year-old Salaam al-Samarai voiced a wide range of views among the survivors, according to which Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki asked the Syrian Government to direct the visa application for the missing to make their home available.
It is believed that more than two and a half million deaths in the country have been avoided.
"It was all right until al-Maliki visited Syria and did not pressure the government to give more visas to the Iraqis in order to move them home," said the Sunnita restor.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who broke my house after I left."
One of the reasons for the slowdown of the force is that droughts have been removed from the soil areas, while droughts have also been removed from the rural areas. As a result, drought has decreased in many rural areas.
Many feel that the sudden appearance of refugees will resurface the treatments that may lead to further wars.
Small Saar - high-level training
The least-favoured association has played a leading role in vocational training, and higher education is an international orientation.
Only in one area of education do we fight the same as the other parts of the country.
"Fifteen days ago I explained to you in a Saar country that we are not French" - this electronic slogan is published on the posters of the 50th birthday of the smallest union.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the Saar Region education system, which can be located in the fifth place on the basis of a study by the German Economic Institute (IW).
In this way, higher education institutions - now only because of traditions - work closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
The students' studies here today can be closed with two or three diplomas.
In line with this, your 15.6 percent is high in foreign audiences.
However, many of them do not have high school performances in the primary schools and universities of the Saar rurals.
"The Saar's field uses the opportunities for vocational training," explained Axel Plünnecke, a German Institute for Economics.
Young people have access to further education in more than one fifth of the schools, with this Saar field exceeding the federal average by more than seven percent.
The professional and senior training combination opportunities have also been well developed.
The secondary research infrastructure is located in Germany in the second half of the population.
However, despite the training and increasing interest in practice, the number of senior managers has declined by yet another third in recent years.
The Ministry of Education of the Saar-Weds has therefore committed itself to marketing procedures for higher education institutions, which are central to measuring sciences.
"We started a number of reforms in general schools following the first Pisa study," said a spokesman from the Ministry of Education.
That is why the government has introduced comparable tests across the country.
In order for children to start learning early, the last spring year is free of charge. This is a model that in time began to change the rest of the association.
If the performance of the students improves consistently, only future comparative studies will provide an answer.
According to the Pisa study conducted in 2003, the proportion of students at risk increased from 29 per cent to 20 per cent.
However, as a whole, the performance of the Saar field has not yet improved to the same extent as the rest of the Union's holdings.
The poor are counting better.
In the course of the Pisa survey, the highest unemployment rate in the Saar rurals is not taken into account in the case of foreign language knowledge - otherwise, in this area, it would be possible for babies to be treated differently,
because the language of the neighbouring countries is a subject for gymnasiums - even if the Saars are not French.
He's moving the clocks.
In Venezuela in the near future, clocks go differently than in other parts of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will return the dates to Latin America by half an hour.
Chavez became a topic of pride in Spain.
As announced by Venezuela's official page, in the sense of a new law, Greenwichi will be returned in four and a half hours.
In this way, the South American State will be part of a period that the world is not in use in any other country.
Among other things, the U.S. Anti-United States Chavez made its decision that the United States has forced the period based on the whole hour.
In addition, Chávez (in local time) announced the destruction of relations with neighbouring Colombia by a storm.
The Balodali nationalist politician stated that while conservative President Alvaro Uribe remained in Colombia, neither the state nor the Colombian government remained in contact with him.
"I can't do this because of my own dignity," Chavez said, which calls for a constitutional reform, which the citizens of Italy must make an opinion in a referendum on Friday.
The reform would significantly build power in the country.
The issue of the dispute was the decision of Uribe to withdraw his mandate from Chávez to allow Colombia Marxist to issue a free tax ruling in negotiations with relatives.
Uribe's decision to buy Venezuela's "arcul" gave her voice critic on Thursday.
He's talking about everyone in Spain.
In the country, a new mobile phone ring appeared: "Por que no te callas" (Why don't you put your voice in it), - so it sounds like the word that has already filled more than half a million people on the Internet.
The story comes from the King of Spain, who was so impressed by the ongoing political statements of the Balodian populist politician that he wished to make it a point.
In 2007 the threat of a reduction in the number of Germans
According to a forecast, the threat of real-life reduction threatens German workers in spite of the strong environment.
Inquiries were under attack by the pessimists.
According to the Hans-Bröckler Foundation estimates, in 2007 applications could be actually underpaid less than in the previous year.
"This is the development of love, the increase in general trade tax and the rapid increase in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn, a member of the Macroeconomic and Conjuncturing Institute on the "Build" page of the "Build".
Other burdens may also be borne by employers in relation to unemployment insurance.
Mr Peer Steinbrück, Minister of Finance, stated in his statement to the "Nue Osnabrücker Zeitung" page that the reduction of decent and sound unemployment insurance at the beginning of the new year would take place.
In any event, the German Federal Labour Agency should not make it difficult to continue to credit or support the association, the German Social Democrat Party, the SPD's policy was rejected.
It was well known that the consumption of foodstuffs and olive oil products resulted in the highest inflation of 13 years.
In annual comparison, prices rose by 3 percent.
The Venus for the Heavens of the Earth
In spite of Russia’s heavy air, it is more like the Earth, as it has so far been said: in the near future, the European "Venus Express" has been exposed to lightnings, and in the neighborhoods it has been discovered as they appear on the Earth.
About three decades ago, scientists are expected to fly in Venice.
The European "Venus Express" has been used with evidence - electromagnetic waves have been discovered on the horizon: The venous villas are spreading over the sky at a height of 56 kilometres, and is working from the Los California University of Los Angeles by Christopher Russell, professor of nature magazine.
According to the famous "Old theory" vilomas have suggested the development of Earth's life: According to the theory, witches have initiated reactions in the ocean leading to the formation of the amino acids, leading to the formation of life's building blocks.
Not in Venice: "If there had ever been life there, it could have been in very early times," explains Sean Solomon from the Washington Carnegie Institute.
At present there is almost a living organism on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is hundreds of times larger than the Earth, and the temperature levels sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"It may be that the Vênus is the hero of the Earth, but still is the brother of the poet," said Russell.
The main question of Esa's transmission is why Venus is so much similar to Earth's mass and size as it goes along a completely different development path.
The beginning of the Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the Venus research, because since the beginning of the 19th century, there has been no time left for this planet to be discovered.
The latest research results already shown in several "Natura" articles, according to researchers, are not only evidenced by the details of the Venetian Agenda.
"It is also shown that the proximity of the planet is greater than we originally expected," said Esa.
In addition to the well-known North-Westphalia, researchers have also discovered a much faster movement of the South-West.
The presence reminds us of the airports of the southern Hemisphere of the Earth, a research group led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Physicala Cosmica.
The second largest planet in the solar system is almost the same as the Earth, and it is nearly as large as the Earth with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers.
The star of Esthaynalcs is also named after the moon within 225 days of the sun.
However, it is much later around its own sea: one Friday lasts 243 days.
Although 460 Celsius-oriented surface temperature, which is similar to that of Vénus 92 bar printing, is almost recalled to the Earth, scientists are starting to realize that both planets are in a similar state.
Both of them had water poured out, which remained as oceans on the Earth, while Venus was being removed from the universe.
And while carbon dioxide is binding on the Earth, most of this atmosphere is being created by Venus.
Takes Markel's meeting with the Dalai Lámá
Köhler, the German President of the international community is following the conclusion of the debate between the parties which is being interrupted by the adoption of the Dalai Láma office.
In a related manner, he criticised the SPD for attacking the Chancellor after September's adoption.
Mr Horst Köhler, President of the German public, is concerned about the view of Germany, and he spoke about the majorisation of the debate on the adoption of the Dalai Láma.
"In this matter, we should not show ourselves to the world as a divided nation," Köhler told the Tradeblatt page.
Köller was able to express his understanding simultaneously that Angela Merkel had adopted the Dalai Lama in September.
"The human rights are equally valid to me even if I respect the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
It is clear that Germany has to deal with the political balance of foreign policy, which the President of the public has stressed; however, Merkel has been protected from the charge that the Chancellor will continue a new Chinese policy.
"The Federal Chancellor didn't break up with the traditional Chinese policy.
China is clear with this," Köhler said.
Mr Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Minister of Foreign Affairs (SPD), called for an appeal against the adoption of the Dalai Láma and therefore became the target of attacks in the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier complained about the EU's foreign policy on "reliance policy".
Following the adoption of the Dalai Láma office, serious disturbances occurred in the German-Chinese community.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only called on the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to SPIEGEL's information, the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the two countries was closed.
Wen Jiabao, head of the Chinese state, now told Angela Merkel's federal office that it was wrong to accept the Dalai Láma.
China rejects that when European politicians officially accept the leader of the Tibetan religion, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The Dalai Láma's actions and words have shown that he is trying to eliminate Tibet from China and other territories that include other Tibetan territories.
Schäuble from concerns similar to those of France
Street meetings with police, shootings, trucks: Wolfgang Schäuble is one of the most disturbing incidents in France.
All must be done to avoid social dissatisfaction in Germany in street forces, followed by the Federal Minister of Health.
Barricks were shot by fire-fighting fires against the police: after the serious disturbances of young people in France, Wolfgang Schäuble, Federal Minister of Association (CDU) of Germany, is held by similar developments.
"We have to say that the social explosives don't move up and out of power.
We really need to get this thing," he said to the newsmagazine "Nue Presse" in Hannover.
Not all young people are right about the rapid changes in social reality.
Associations, holdings and communities are currently working intensively to solve the problem, Schäuble said.
It's not just about the integration of immigrants.
"The first success has been demonstrated in close cooperation with the Islamic Conference from the start of the integration summit."
But it's too early to solve the emergency situation.
Schäuble at the same time said that there were no urban and sociological problems in German cities such as France.
In Paris' northern suburbs last night, young people fought heavy street fights with the police.
Cars and public buildings were also rented in Toulouse.
In view of all of this, Kenyan Kolat, Head of the German Turkish Community, took a greater role in the integration process.
In connection with the French disturbances, Kolat warned of "the dangers of poisoning".
Although the situation in Germany is not as comfortable as it is in France,
But action is still necessary.
Kolat said that the unemployment rate is "higher than average" for young people who have been born from immigrant families under 25 years of age.
You should take care of more education than anyone else.
He said, "We need to give you a perspective for young people."
However, the Head of the Turkish Community added that "social supervision within the family" is much more present in Germany than in France.
Many young people who come from a immigrant family would not want to destroy what their parents built up here.
Kolat warned, "We must be part of this."
For young people "as soon as possible to be able to work and participate in education".
Meanwhile in the city of Paris, Villaries-le-Bel spent a whole night of rest.
Hundreds of police were ready to enter. A helicopter lighted the area.
The competent authorities reported on three guards and a number of minor offenders and the car.
Since the report, a security unit with 1,000 heads on a train is responsible for the rest.
The police are always ready to intervene until necessary, after visiting Deputy Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie.
During the two rounds of the night, 80 police were injured in the streets following the Viliers-le-bel attacks.
The next night the disturbances were transferred to Toulouse.
The injuries were related to a traffic accident during which two young people lost their lives on Friday.
According to the government's first findings, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
Highness Angela in the office
The fact that the chancellor's action has been interrupted is evidence that the coalition is going to end - and nothing is expected of him anymore.
In what country does the Federal Chancellor actually live?
After the general discussion of the Bundestag, including its contents, it must be established after a general and concrete action: it is not here - it is not in the country whose government would be his business.
Yes, with appropriate wording, he directed the case back to Angela Merkel, which said he would focus too much on foreign policy.
This was a provincial answer, and in such a way it only made a statement that he didn't want to understand what his critics were talking about.
The Association Assembly made it clear to everyone how much attention is being given.
At the same time, there was no particular interest or empathy about the country's problems.
On the contrary, High Commissioner Angela: a politician who is out of the truth who goes into foreign policy and there is only uncertainty.
Example of climate protection: The Heilidendam Decision will give its direct attention to how climate objectives should be achieved in the country.
In general, as far as self-esteem is concerned, the lack of such love would not have been allowed two years ago by your CDU president.
Now it's possible in the phrase that prosperity has become a positive influence on people.
This brought the good news of a pragmatic personality that instead of the dictionary, gave a solution to the problems.
However, in the senior office of Angela, internal political problems are only a matter of concern.
The problems of childhood poverty and low income?
It's only a few minutes late.
Many of these are from the point of view of how harsh language is to be followed when it comes to family responsibilities.
Three times, Markel has to ask him to bring up a half-to-half-inch statement.
If it's about concrete, it's about foreign bots.
Roham Attorney General
During the debate held in YouTube, the Republican presidents, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, took a difficult turn - and now they have to keep out of a foreign mark.
The complexity of the characters has already been highlighted in connection with the first topic.
Because Romney's been fighting against Rudy Giulian for the "saving of illegal immigrants" in New York.
In contrast to the serious facts of his own part, "I say that his own home has been used as an escape for illegal immigrants," Giuliani returns to his former government of Massachusetts and says that he has been employed as a private person by non-documented migrants.
The candidates go to Rohamra: Since the Republican camp continues to have no uniform support, the eight presidents are pleased to use the CNN discussion in front of all to undermine its faith.
Internet users sent their own 30 second-minute videos via YouTube are almost more than short summaries.
"The sort of isolationism we have been able to exert power in Hitler," says John McCain of the opposition, Ron Paul, who follows the immediate withdrawal from Iraq alone.
Romney's head is also basically at Vietnam's gate when it shows that it is a curse for the so-called "Waterboarding" hearing system, which stimulates water intake.
That the main topics of the campaign are still too much to be covered by discussions about the bans in Iraq, which are shown by reactions to the Florida public of St. Petersburg.
Hangos taps are released in the field by dicating conservation values and avoiding future taxation.
In the meantime, the weaknesses of the two characters will become ever more evident.
"I've been wrong in Akkori," he says, "I'm sorry," and he apologizes to the supporters and television viewers because in 1994 he was still in debt-distorted.
However, Giuliani’s reaction is not uncommon when she asks for an explanation from the Bible.
Mustarraf as a civil governor for the first time
One day after the return of the army, he was ordered to relocate the former President of Musharraf, who is in power in Pakistan.
With this eight-year military rule, Pakistan ends.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was disappointed at his appointment for a further five-year official term.
Pakistan's television from the capital, the President of Islamabad's palace, has brought the ceremony into focus.
Muharraf has sworn to the Constitution and made his people do good.
He handed over his trusted military commander, Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus allowed international pressure from the United States before all.
After eight years of power in the form of military pucks without blood, the former camps are now in the first instance civil state.
Muharraf's return as chief commander of the armed forces made it enough for peace and resistance to be a fundamental requirement.
Further important requirement is the abolition of the exceptional status announced on 3 November by Muharraf.
According to Chief of Malik Muhammad Qayum, Muharraf has recently abolished the extraordinary state of affairs by which Nuuga meets another requirement.
The Supreme Court of the country, which, following the publication of the exceptional state of Muharraf, sat with him at the beginning of November, rejected all objections in the last week concerning the re-election of the State concerned on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in the tribal territory of the north, North Vaziristan lost five troops and four more wounded following the attack against a military contingent.
According to information published by the military commander, the bomb was bombed near the Afghanistan border.
Krautrock's father's return
You were once again the seven-year-old German super team: Harmonia's three bandits resounded their voice until the end of a Berlin concert.
With the use of the reconnaissance of the lights, from the time of "Live 1974" there is a desired recording.
They were better known abroad at the time.
The reported sensation was killed by three agreed men in the area of dinner.
They're all in front of their own voice, their own cable and their own buttons in front of everyone.
Dieter Moebius is 63 years old in the middle of the throne.
Michael Rother, who was 57 years old at the end of his life, offered a laptop and guitar.
From the public you're looking at the 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Rodelius and concentrate on the console.
Each of them produces some kind of sound, while one-time rhythm.
And sometimes it's a random song.
However, you don't seem to be particularly upset by your peers.
It was a great surprise for the Krautrock musicians to know that you were in harmonia together again.
What we can learn here: As a result of a proper procedure, we can determine that the name has been transferred to the collective memory, but in no case has left any remaining traces of this band unharmed after 32 years.
But why can't I celebrate the lives of the Germans for seventeen years?
Most importantly, what we call a Krautrock in England and America has always been more appreciated than in his own home.
When the singer gave the Echo award for life in 2003 to members of the nearby Can family together, the German pop figures sat in the field with their unintelligent faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers broadcast even thanked La Düsseldorf and the Neu! colleagues, the surprise was endless.
Then Michael Rother was on the stage with Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Homelessness and foreign acceptance are the only two sides.
The memory is already overemphasized by harmonia, because the trio has only existed for two years, and it has had little effect over time than others have recently given it.
Moebius and Rodelius had previously played with Conrad Schnitzler under the name of many promising cluster.
At first they played in the pool under the Berlin Schaubühne theater.
Then in Düsseldorf, an economic advantage for a loan company financed by the church.
For a short time, Rutherford helped the Kraftwerk team together, and in this case, perhaps the most prestigious German band, the Neu! brand you received as a guitar.
In 1973, however, Rutherford followed up with the Cluster’s songs in their composition in Weserbergland Forest.
There, in Alter Weserhof, they lived in a 16th - century Roman city as a communist.
Less ideologically than in the I. Commune where Rodelius was still a babysitter.
Their life is more like an art.
It's probably from the perspective of the Hormonium Ottenstein Dalarda, and this is how they found their name for their art.
Some of these things have been settled by Harmony.
First album titled "Music von Harmonia" and next "De Luxe".
Despite the noise and noise music, the company suffered material needs.
The collection didn't make it possible for them to find themselves alone.
The "Live 1974" CD was taken up in a concert held in Greece, before about 50 major records audiences, so someone remembers.
In the case of the strengthening of Harmony and the repeated practice of the matter, Rother had an idea.
For Rodelius and Moebius this is a moral requirement.
The gang reported his breakdown in 1975.
He was tied out of the esoteric and held up on albums like "Flammeme Herzen".
The cluster was restored in the eighth century, which was more successful than the harmony ever.
Thanks to the Greek live album Herbert Grönemeyer.
His listener, named Greenland, set fire to take care of the Krautrock as a German personal gift of his life.
In this context, Neu! has already been presented in the same way as Rodelius' speech.
The demonstration of harmony is held in the Berlin Cultural House.
From the money inside the Woodtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, the author of the book "Krautrock Sampler" and "Krautrock Sampler".
He's still in charge of Loveparade, too, Dr. Motte.
It's all about the effect of Krautrock on the next popzene cycle.
In this respect, Harmonia has filled out an empty space for the super team.
Brian Eno's conclusion, along with the most unusual sounds, goes into the field: "The only true music is the future."
Images of the poor who are portrayed by the producer in a parachute room with the Harmonica.
The removal of further black-white photographs of the hair-adhesive equipment serves the construction of the landscape.
In the meantime, three vets are again involved with improvisation.
This only makes it possible to set up microphones for the organ and the pumping device with the sound equipment that they have designed themselves with the help of sound tools that have not yet heard sound effects.
Today's electric music looks like electric music.
Three, deep-fashioned boater.
Not even the housewife has changed anything.
Barbara Morgenstern is being held in the kitchen and kissed, and sing "Aaaaaaaah" with a beautiful experience.
Because the Krautrock was always very English.
He never talked about rock.
The gurus were less sought in blue than in the art schools (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or just before going to art and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone came up here "'68!" he's not going in the wrong way, and that's why Harmony doesn't let himself out of peace yet.
Even more meaningful things are being considered on the stage.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
This can be very frustrating, or it can be offered in moments of exceptional happiness.
Richard Gere simply isn't Chinese enough
Two movies are again involved in the Balkan war through "The War" and "Mörderischer Frieden".
But none of them will.
The fundamental idea or too much towards action and shooting, or too sensitive.
You can't even help Richard Gere in the "Creation."
The good news is first: Although the two war criminals, Karadzsic and Mladics are still in the Balkan mountains, right there, they were found in the dark behind the Bosnian war again for the stage, Richard Gere.
In recent years, we have missed out on the best of eight years of men, because many of the best-known role played in women's sensitive films and many press conferences on Buddhism have also taken our interest in our well-being.
And so, Richard Gere's quickest idea is that maybe we're still looking at the "Court" film.
Wonderful, exciting design: In addition to Simon Hunt's design, what Gere could have done in this case was not so hard to add: A man who had been behind you for more than a few years, but his life as a Roman monument still preserved a significant part of his former career.
However, this week's film and the production of the German "Mörderischer Frieden" will continue to be an endless series of films about the Balkan war, despite the fact that the production of "Mörderischer Frieden" continues.
The film "Mörderischer Frieden" does not have to be lost much: The film speaks of two German soldiers serving in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serbian woman from Kosovo doctors, and one of them even likes her as soon as possible.
While it is welcome that now that the organs are not once portrayed as all the wrong causes, a film that promotes the performance of television films is too quick to take place in shooting and event events.
The "Cobra 11" symbol is a car instead of a war.
In this respect, for example, in the case of "False" it is possible to examine why not even one really good film about the Balkan war has been produced.
The three U.S. officials' story, which stands out to find a Serbian war capital on the name "Róka", with another officer, another driver's office (both in Richard Shepard's personal union), might have been a new "Apocalypsian now" at another time.
Because history shows a striking parallel: In both cases small groups want to go to the forest to end what the army is unable to do - and in both cases travel into madness.
One of the reasons why Simon Hunt just doesn't let his heart be as kinic as he first shows him.
No, and as a result of the runaway book, he also had a romantic relationship with a Muslim woman who was murdered in the latter.
The "Courage" will end when the reporters reach what Nato, the CIA and the world have not been able to do in the last five minutes of the film: they will commit war crimes and will be handed over to the Mohamedan Bosnians for the sake of justice.
It's so bad that man's best turn to the Hague International Law is due to the crime committed against his logic of music.
And the film's goal is deeply human.
He argues that Karadzsic and Mladics are still freer and that it suspects the Americans and the French (in this case, they are still extremely united) that they do not continue to do so in an intensive manner because of secret political issues.
But the good and the bad sometimes are so much like each other that a famous Brecht verse goes into your mouth.
In this context, the poet writes the following about the famous Asian demon found on the desk: "In a short time, it is the smelling of candles, which reveals what is bad for them."
Films such as the "Creation" have masks of human form, which, however, show how boring it is to be.
This problem is not limited to the work of movies about the Balkan war.
It was recently discovered in the news that all Hollywood films about Iraq were a bunch of ghosts.
We can add: Not even a good movie about South Africa.
It's only always valid: If a star goes through the world's streets or acne fields, then it's like "The Free Bears" with Patricia Archette, "Without Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Creed Games" with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close to time.
Because they had to leave for decades while Hollywood was able to run a good movie from the holocaust with the "Schindler List" film.
Some movies are probably still in place - because today's classics about Vietnam's war, such as "The Snare", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have not been celebrated as one of their own most famous works.
But it can be imagined that today, when all mass murder is a real time, it's suddenly coming to our home through two pictures, just too much about the world's conflicts.
And this will distract the runners from ignoring the truth that would be needed to tell the good news.
Because "Lenny or not" or "The dictator" finally succeeded so well because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how terrible the Nazi race really is.
Maybe you don't have to waste your time if you want to make a good movie.
Perhaps we should be placed in a very far-fetched artistic view of the regenerative Lawrence Norfolk.
When the historical empire of "The Lemprière-lexicon" and the conflict between the Balkan War were torn apart, he replied, "It's just that certain things never change.
The great cities will always be dangerous, people will always kill them in a fair way, and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
Von Beausto is being criticised for the release of the Olympics
The determination of the Mayor has changed strongly from a proposal for the organisation of the national Olympic Games in Hamburg in political and economic life.
Many still want to fight to organize water games.
However, Von Beust paid close attention to the facts during the transaction.
The Prime Minister of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described the referendum this afternoon as "not interested in the economic environment".
No other project has recently released such powerful motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective we would not be able to maintain a level playing field."
Schmidt-Trenz said that he did not want to finish the project, but he was working on a long-term initiative, "which starts from modified time coordinates".
In addition to earlier statements by Mayor Ole von Beaust, the ambitions of the Hamburg Olympic Games are not realized by at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on the Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Association," declared von Beaust to the WorldT Online.
He sent a decision to start the Sports Union in early December on the Munich bid for the 2018 Summer Olympic Games.
"To this end, our participation means so much that we have so far decided that there will not be real opportunities within the extended period of 2028."
However, we don't finally give up the dream, von Beust said.
The complaint of the Hamburg Sports Union (HSB) was dismissed by von Beust.
This has led to the pressure that Hamburg will not be able to play Olympic games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early for us to miss an opportunity to break our plans now," said Günter Ploß, HSB President.
The withdrawal from the invitation is contrary to the statement made by the Senate President in his opinion at the General German University Sports Assembly.
The same proposal for Von Beaust Hamburg to the University in 2015 indicated that it did not serve as a role model for the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The High School Sports Association just started in the last week as a candidate city in Hamburg.
The SPD’s civil group has raised the Senate that it has left valuable time for the construction of the hamburger.
"The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has lasted for years in the Senate because it has been growing along with the Olympics and prevented the building from being built," said two SPD representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD continued its work with the integrated plan for the use of Olympics and later residential use, the CDU placed the volume on the other side of the "examination factor".
The 2012 invitation to the 2012 Nyári Olympic Games changed a great deal at the time in Hamburg.
However, it was at Hamburg Lipcs.
These aren't Warhol's teeth.
The one that connects Sweden and its borders with each other, to Ikear, and you don't think Andy Warholra.
Or is it?
Currently produced in Sweden, they are making a dark treasure for the list of Warhol's works.
This list of nine "Stockholm Type" is mostly counterfeited by Brillo Box.
After a couple of months of doubt on the origin of Andy Warhol of 1968, the Swedish leaf "Expressen" now resulted in an internal survey of the stockholm Moderna Museum: The Pontus Hultén, a former museum director of the Moderna Museum in 1995, was awarded the sixth "Brillo Box" and is most likely to be part of the hundreds more "Stockholm-type" Box in the international business market.
The long and complicated history of art and curatorium shows is a chain that is confused.
Warhol founded the first "Brillo Boxait" in New York in 1964 - the "Brillo" cardboard box based on a blue-white format.
In a 1968 exhibition held at the Modern Museum - with the agreement of Warhol - the hundreds of Brillo soldiers prepared from cartons were set out: These (for budgetary reasons) were not from Warhol but were transported directly from the Brillo Carton Tower.
It wasn't about art, it was about the soap operas, it was about a simple show set.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission for the sale of some Brillo-Faldas in Sweden, which were not set up in the Modern Museum.
The old witnesses are now talking about a painting that has been legalized as an Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the "Stockholm-type" in the art and price history.
Some of them were paid for over $100,000.
The problem is, however, that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum manager, in the course of the later years, has falsely stated that in 1968 hundreds of diamonds were produced and exported in Sweden, which he then left behind in Warhol's era.
In fact, Hultén's 105th floor was built only in 1990 for a St. Petersburg exhibition in Malmö.
At this point, however, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, director of the Modern Museum's main art studio at the museum, also examined three Swedish-owned box with six Brillo Box, two of which were produced in 1968 in Stockholm: The printed sales pages were first founded and then rolled up, after which the white oil was removed.
Unlike the other structures of the 1990s, it is argued that the paintings were taken directly from the market page - not by oil - but by acrylic painting.
"The artist didn't approve these shoes, so they should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxains," says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museum: "If New York 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' does not decide otherwise, the Modern Museum will be listed as another/exhibitive material in its collection."
The Authentication Board has, of course, announced in June that "serious charges have been made against the following Spanish-speaking eyes".
Since then, however, they have become unsolicited.
Manila's men are leaving.
The strike was carried out on the Füllöp River by the soldiers who had taken their lives in a manic hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He can't take responsibility for the bloodshed, told the reporters at our hotel manager Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral marriage.
Precisely, the hotel was surrounded by low-gased soldiers.
He's been taking you to the building for two thousand hours.
The team was facing trial before the trial in 2003 because of a failed rape test - including Trillanes.
He used the interview to be immediately with 30 sympathies.
The military police responsible for the man's custody were apparently transferred to him and joined him to the police station.
They went to the Peninsula Hotel, and then they demanded that Ms. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo be arrested.
Government units closed down the front hotel area.
The president invited the security office to a special meeting.
Norberto Gonzales, Security Council, condemned the military procedure.
"They've got their hands on people," Trillanes said.
"We'll call people here to join us."
Captain Danilo Lim, who was formerly commander of the Scout Rangers elite, said that the army wanted to join the army within a short time.
The judges of the government filed strong opposition against the President on Friday.
The government has been plagued by corruption charges for several months.
Manila's financial area had already been the main stage of a campaign against Arroyo organized by 200 members of the army in 2003.
The rise took place almost 24 hours later when the army was able to join.
Since 1986 at least seven cases have taken place in the Füllöp Islands against democratically elected governments.
The United Internet will be a major player in the competition
The United Internet has provided more than 20 percent of its share in the Competition telecommunications company.
As the company announced it last night, the average attendance was 14.46 Euros.
This is the principal property of 20.05 percent.
Prior to the transfer, meetings were held in the spring.
The opportunity to increase the ownership acquired in the Competition remains open.
With this step they want to contribute to the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet has been announced.
Earlier this afternoon, the source was provided with a possible connection after Berenberg Bank increased its share in the Düsseldorf network by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The financial institution only maintains its share of one third of its assets, which is reported on the financial market.
On the previous day, the United Internet had already withdrawn 10 percent of the Drillish mobile phone.
Within the framework of the investigation, Drillish placed 17.4 million new shares at EUR 106.4 million.
The United Internet bought 5.15 million shares for EUR 31.4 million.
In addition, companies have initiated a dialogue on cooperation in the market for DSL and mobile products.
"We strengthen our partnership," said a spokesman for the United Internet.
The two companies set up the MSPs together for the purpose of transferring the competitive Freenet.
In the beginning, the two companies are satisfied with the good ten percent share they received in Freenet and do not live by the right of Freenet to take over another 18.49 percent, announced on Thursday the United Internet.
However, the two companies are open to all opportunities, especially in view of the participation of Freenet AG, says the news.
The negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet were concluded between the strategic partnership in mid-November.
Freenet has been around for months and is now only part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contractual mobile phones and 1,27 million DSL and a leading access client.
The United Internet and Drillish government has so far been directly involved in Freenet 6.01 percent.
Now there's an agreement that Drillish's next round will bring in four percent.
An agreement was concluded in August on the right to purchase 1849 % of the VAT investment company.
