Croatia is planning a nuclear treatment facility. Bosnians are protesting.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in the north-western city of Bosnia and Herzegovina and protested the plan of neighboring Croatia to remove some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near a river known as Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The demo participants in the city of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Novi Grad, promised Croatia a strong commitment to fight against the plan for the Tulgofska Gora Army.
It's going to take away the wastes from the nuclear power plant of Krassico.
"Don't take a healthy future," the Bosnians quoted as saying, "We need a steady stop to the flood," said that the nuclear waste treatment facility may only threaten the lives of some 250,000 people living around the river.
We must resist.
Novey, the leader of the Grade Self-Government, Miroslav Drika, told the crowd this.
We must fight for their well-being and for their well-being.
"The Crusco nuclear power plant, which began driving in the 980s, is located in Slovenia and owned jointly with Croatia.
Government stakeholders in both countries are planning to open the next week's meeting and discuss the increase in waste management facilities.
Croatia's delivery was on Friday, and Croatia was not yet to decide whether to build a bridge on its own, and whether Slovenia should still pay for the repairs of Croatia's wastes that were being dealt with in the new building.
Mr. Tomislav Chorich, Minister of Environmental Protection of Croatia, said that Croatia had problems with the treatment of public buildings from prison and that it wanted to find a comprehensive solution.
In Bosnia, activists and officials of all national groups in the country, and residents of Croatia, claimed to find another building site near their own country.
"Why, throughout Croatia, would the pockets of Bosnia, or the Tugofska Gora be the most suitable place?" Dollyarka asks.

The increase in consumption tax since October.
This is what the country is starting to do. "Cashures Point" is the main business.
It's going to take up a maximum of 5% to prevent consumption freeze, but it's going to be "case".
And before the tax increases... the store and the business, they're gonna bring the cashiers in and lead them.
So, what's going on is, "I'm going in and I'm going to go in."
I've been selling cash to you so far.

I'm going to go to the store and the workers immediately.

"No, we're only dealing with cash, old-fashioned..."
Pay Pay Pay Anda said, "I don't think it's going to be possible to pay the rent, so I think it's going to be faster if I'm used to it than cash."
So far, we've launched a 100 billion-billion-dollar campaign for 20% of the use.
But Mr. Anda's "Education Man" was first used by the user, or "Pay Pay" in the store.
So far, it's been a business of cash.
The manager also heard from Mr. Anda and asked me to join PayPay.
Mr. Pay Pay Pay Anda said, "I really think it's good to be busy right now.
In the country's main business system, consumers are on the "Cash of Casualization"!
Mr. Anda's reason to go to the storm was, but the country's 'consumer' is the main business.
In October, the State will introduce a system that will provide 5 per cent of the most purchased goods to prevent consumption tax increases, but it will be a "case settlement".
There are only a few small shops that think you're going to introduce cash before tax increases.

What about the anti-munehausen syndrome group that appeared in the Zaan Politician of Netfrix?
The condition is that the guardian and the parents lie that a healthy child is sick.
The police will be released today at Netfrix.
The drama is the story of Pitton Hobert, the president of the United States, but it's the first stage of his high school.
It was created by American Holler Starley and Gray's producer Ryan Murphy, and it was performed by Guinness Partroo, Ben Platt, and Lucy Bointon.
It doesn't seem like it's just a network for those who can't see the drama yet, but it's like the role of an anti-munehausen syndrome group -- it's like a mental illness, even if the person under it is not really sick, but physically and mentally.
There are different kinds of diseases, but they're actually sick, and they're also included in the Munhihausen syndrome group.
But it's a case of anti-munehausen syndrome. It's a lie that someone else under their protection is sick.
It's known as FII, lying or spreading disease, and it's a form of child abuse.
It's a rare condition, but it's usually a major increase in the parent's symptoms, and it's a disease that may make the child sick.
So what is there about the symptoms of the anti-munehausen syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease are changing in case bikes, but NHS is focusing on the following things.
If the child is healthy, he will try to explain his condition to the doctor.
I'm going to explain it to you, or I'm going to charge you with a false symptom.
In addition, if you want to include boutu sugar in the test material, you will produce the results to make your child think he is sick.
I'm going to have a problem with giving me drugs and other drugs.
How common are the symptoms of representative Munhi Hauzen?
Because many cases are not reported, it's hard to know how wide these symptoms are.
In a study published in 2000, it was estimated that there were 89 cases of disease in 100,000 people over the next two years.
What should we do if the child's victim is in doubt?

Nigeria: Police force school investigators in Kadunna and 300 child survivors
Qaduna-Kadhana police yesterday conducted a forced investigation at Imam Armad Ben Hambar School in Rein Meiduben, in Igabi County yesterday, and arrested 7 teachers and rescued about 300 children.
The police say children were placed in a non-human environment, but school sides reject this claim.
A resident named Chief, who is a school priest, says, "Because children get all their parents' commitments, their claims are not true."
"Before the children entered school, the parents signed a contract.
They're bringing food to their children every day, so they know what kind of environment they're in.
I was surprised when the police came and took away the children and all the food they had received from their parents and closed the school.
This is unfair treatment for some parents who can testify to the fact that they have left their children in a terrible environment like the police say.
He added that he had once visited the former Chief of Police, Abdularman, to see how the children were in the environment, but that he did not say anything about suffering.
And they're just learning the Koran. That's what they're saying.
But the police release room, Mr. Jacob Sabbo, says that children will be reunited with their parents when they are transferred to the state government.
"In the name of the Qur'an, they were in a state of non-humanity.
There was a lot of injuries in the back of many children.
So I'm looking for a school to find out about the owner of the facility."
I don't know what's going on in China.

Three times, the sex column of the high school will be removed, and the sex minority will be taken care of: North Sea news.
It was found that on 28 days, the three-year-old education commissions decided to remove a high-level gender column from the school.
In the "8-year-old students" trial, the teacher admitted that she did not have a record of the choice of the sex column, but she would have lost her identity for 20 years.
For class division and sports groups, secondary schools use the research manuals they create.
Only in the research book, you can register for free, and you can describe the other sex column that you've chosen.
According to the Commissions, the sex column of the public high school is determined to remove from the North Sea and the Pacific from the 20th century.

I asked for a strong partner to look for customer satisfaction and value with us, but this time I'm sure we can provide everyone in Pennsylvania as soon as possible on the market and on the planned online offer of this kind of sport games and casinos. "And the senior director of the Kindredus, Manuel Stan, said.
In the online market, we have organized online companies and sports bookmakers around the world, and we are offering our existing customers the best class experience and inviting new fans.
The university's market leadership is a major step forward not only in the Mohigan San, but also in the Pennsylvania state of Pennsylvania. "Abram Alroy, Prime Minister of Interactive Gameming and Entertainment of Mohigan Gaming and Entertainment, says.

[20-year-old Sabalenka]
Last year, Sabalenka, a conference partner, got a 75-percent score at the time of entry into the Forest Service.
He won a three-fold service game at the World Bank's 1st World Bank, which took 8th Double Fort, and won an 43th hour.

A girl rapper from the Central Coast's "very immoral" dress, ordered against the victims in court.
In May 2017, a man who wore his own colorful glycssus took 12-year-old girls back to school in the Central Coast of the state.
And then the man forced the girl into the tree and added sexual violence.
After the arrest, house search warrants were issued, and the police seized most of the items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, men found themselves guilty of seven suspects, including suspicions of sexual abuse, of violence this time and other 11-year-olds.
As the 12-year-old victim was walking along the narrow road, he saw a man who was armed with a large wooden knife and a knife coming out of his pocket.
When the girl asked, "Don't, don't, don't."
The man says to the girl, "Don't shout.
I'm going to have to put my eyes in my eyes when I'm out of my voice."
The man had his right hand and took the girl's hands with his right arm and hit the tree and abused me for about an hour.
He cried like he was crazy. He went to school.
The man received several e-mails and calls from his colleagues at work but did not respond until 9:00 a.m.
The man stood out in his clothes like wheat, barley, wood, and he suffered violence on the road and followed the driver until he was beaten.
The man's trial will continue on Monday.
Mr. Roman, the development of AI should be based on public interest and warn the IT business representative.
Roman Emperor Francisco warned IT business representatives, diplomats, and investors that if they did not share the moral value of public interest, they could develop competition and other digital developments would increase social inequality.
The priest said at a Vatican meeting of government diplomats, Facebook and Googlers, as well as psychologists, physicists and moralists.
In this conference entitled "The Public Interests of the Digital Age," a number of students and Catholic teachers were also invited.
The three-day meeting proved to be the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in future and dangerous debate in the development of human knowledge.
At the meeting, discussions were held on the future of the development of wartime technology and increased machine work, while a case-by-case review of the shootings in the New Zealand Cristcherch and the social media companies' violent films were conducted.
In his own speech at the conference, the pope expressed his appreciation for the development of technical progress in opening up machinery for industrial revolutions and freeing workers from risks and simple work.
But if we rely on the robot industry to pursue interests, we also warn that we are afraid that we will lose our job dignity.
"If technological progress is the cause of growing inequality, it's not the right step," the priest warned.
If human technological progress is opposed to public interests and enemies, it would be contrary to the situation of wild animals based on the theory of the mighty.
According to the chairman of the meeting, the participants wanted to use their expertise and to see future questions of the Catholic Church about the Heitects.
The long-distance sapples are playing at the G.A.'s show!
Thank you, ma'am. — Thank you.
In the mid-27th (Matuzda) war, the long-distance alien (34) first appeared on the "4th left" island.
It was "September" of Ars Wind & Fayer's "September" at the first two deaths in the run-off season.

I'm happy to be an assistant to all of you, Martin Woodegoll.
Martin Woodegoll discovered an ass from the top of Michael O'Alsabal.
Real Madrid won Ossana in 2 to 0 and updated the failed records in this country, and went up to the top of the Ligga table.
However, despite the fact that there's no compromise in the race today, in Siesen, La Rega, the active open war and the obvious discrepancy with Wales's star electoral gallery, Genedean Giandean is not always placed in a position.
When Real Madrid was humiliated by Paris Sanderman (PSG) at the Championships, it seemed that the pressman had reached my limit.
But as Jean-Jedan and Real Madrid have natural ability, there are voters who do not join the current monitoring plan.
Winnisius Junior is currently playing in a team with one of the leading players who has the future of the real Madrid.
But in real society, another young Norwegian man, Martin Woodegor, who was transferred to Lental, is also providing excellent assistants in the L.R. War.
Martin Woodegor played the real Socieda battle against the Arabes, and Michael O'Alsabal was a heavenly assistant, and Real Socieda won a total victory between 3 and 0.
Martin Woodegoll, who received the ball from the right, sent the two other voters to O'Alsabal with a completely accurate slotball and decided to gole.
The second round of William Jose's career and the third three-time Penartispot of Oyarsabal, confirmed the overwhelming victory of the Imanoral team before the Arabs, the midfielder, the Maunas, the Galicia electors, finished five minutes ago.
Martin Woodegor, who joined Real Madrid at the age of 16, 2015, has been suffering for four years to develop some kind of fineness.
This 20-year-old Norwegian youth seems to be opening up the president at last.
The name of Sharad Pawal was surprised to meet with the Bank of Mahalashutra, the state of Mahalalashtura.
Anna Hasare said, "When this complaint came in contact, the name of Sharad Paule was not on the list."
Anna Hazalre, a social activist, was surprised that the name of the National Congress Party (NCP) leader, Sharad Pawal, was suddenly raised in a joint bank fraud case with thousands of rupees.
In connection with the same fraud case, the Bureau of Investigation (ED) filed a fund-raising complaint against the Deputy Prime Minister of the State of Agent Pearl Mahalashutra.
On the basis of the Financial Laundering Prevention Act, the report of the Executive Board which was opposed to the first report of the police was registered by the central authorities.
This complaint is based on the first report of the Mumbai Police report, which was reported by Agent Pawell and 70 co-sponsors of the Bank.
When this complaint came in contact, there was no name of Sharad Paul.
When I asked about the suspicion that Sharad Pawell and the executive board had been involved in the fraud, Anna Hazarre said to the woodman: "How did the name of Sharad come up, who spoke to them alone?"
Anna Hazalre, who criticized Sharad Paul, expressed the hope that if the executive carried out a detailed investigation into the fraud case, the truth would be found.
Anna Hazalre, who is a member of many of the clean-up operations, said, "The executives will know what his name has been raised in this case."
Sharad Pawell denied all the wrongs and claimed that there was no real connection with the common bank and questioned the timing of a complaint that was filed on 21 October in the elections of the state parliament of Maharashtra.
The U.S. Prime Minister clearly pointed to the Indian People's Party's Government and stated that he should not be ashamed of Delly's "kingdom."
NCP called this executive's complaint a political one.
South Africa: KUZN student Sinesenba Androb accused of murdering 20-year-olds
According to the NPA, a student at the University of Quaselle Natral (UKZN) is expected to apply for insurance next week for the murder of Mr. Sinesemba Androb.
The same suspect came to the Müsinga Security Court on Monday.
Natarsha Carra, journalist of the Quasser Natral Survey, said to NEWS24 that the complaint was extended on 2 October.
He added that the government is looking forward to the security of the suspects.
According to police officer Tembeka Müberel, Kuwazler Natar, 20-year-old suspects were arrested on Monday.
When Mr. Androb was attacked under the left and the back, the police came in this week.
Mr. Androb is saying he's been in contact at the Mosinga Drifkarna Motor Sports Event.
In a statement made on that day, the owner of the motor sports event said that the number of customers who were able to watch the music was expected to remain behind after the event was finished.
Sadly, one of them was attacked by men whom they did not know on the way, and he died in the hospital.
The UKZN said that it was the death of Mr. Androb that "we need to think carefully as a community about the atrocities that are so common in this society."

Milan, I agree to pay $30 million for the Epipensian settlement.
Since Milan did not provide investors with information on the lack of demand for epiphany for medical care, he agreed to pay $3 million.
On Friday, the U.S. Trade Commission announced that Milan had classified Epipen as "Generic" as "Generic" in the medical program.
This has helped me to see that the payment to the government of the drug company was lower than the limit if the epipens were classified as "Brand".
In July, Milan announced that it had reached a basic agreement with the SEC on this matter.
The company's statement on Friday is certainly not rejected about the SEC's claim.
Axelpedal's accident will be no more!
Auto Messe Web - Yahoo! News
I'm going to buy some security for the accident and Lisbon.
A traffic accident caused by a driver's vehicle.
Or the case of a high driver's fault with Brooke and Axel's fault is growing.
And then when I'm on my way out, I'm going to be panicking, and I'm going to have to get a little bit of an axel.
A new vehicle with security transport support features such as the future cover of this driving misbehavior is present, but there are also possible rear-view devices on which the vehicle is not fitted.
This post is part of our special coverage Aeronautics.
I'd like to show you how each one has its own characteristics.
We're going to get a little bit of a little bit out of here.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] In a new perspective, the Pibots developed "e-ACCEL ALARM".
We're going to avoid past mistakes in the "warning sound."
When the crew stopped or slowed down, there was a "warranted sound" when it was necessary to break up with Brooke and Axelpedal.
We're going to force us to return the response to the voice and quickly recognize our mistakes.
As a result of an axel failure, the change in the sound of the engine is clear and effective for the high-speed driver that is listening.
It's just a two-sided OBDII connector.
It's the price and the value of the 9800 dollars (tax) and the amount of the cash that you need to set.
The World Wing started sales in mid-September, but the Axel Blackie's wrong device is also being protected."
I'll take it back when I'm back.
When Axelpedal is on the front and back of the vehicle (and 10Km/h) and is on the front and back of the vehicle, it detects both the speed and the brake signal on the side of the vehicle and controls the speed of the start of the axle electrically.
When an axelpedal is wrong, do not send the signal from the axel, and control the prompt output by changing the clip mode (the state of the block in Drenzi).
In the back of the back, I've been able to track the speed of more than 5Km/h, and I've been able to force the vehicles to switch to clip.
So if you want to do this, you can just get a simple connection.
The total price is $307,000.

It's all right, then we're going to have a final sentence on each of the numbers."
It's the next judge to be sentenced to death.
The judgment is scheduled to be delivered on 12 November.
Birds, animal riding skills, Nepal's agricultural ministers, three times the U.S. newspaper.
[On the right of the Dawa Agricultural Minister of Nepal, who oversees the recycling facility, at the recycle park of the bird.]
[Flights] Ten of the ministers of the Dawa Dorche Rama Farms of Nepal visited three major poultry farms on 26 days, and the city's rice cycle park with the city's east-east.
In the same country, they followed and treated most of the population, but through students left, the teacher of the Japanese School of Agricultural Masters in Zing (67), who was studying in Ziz, started a program to guide the city of Katomans, which led to the risk of entry into the city.
Since technology is being used at the same facility as the 19-year-old bird city, it will begin its inspection in February 30th, and this time it will be a three-time inspection team visit.
The Prime Minister, who took part in the survey, spoke to a local mayor in the city center, saying, "The Japanese technology is moving around the world, not just to promote national integration," and asked for the exchange of city connections into the field.
The mayor of the village said, "I'm surprised that I haven't gone to all the birds' cities yet.
It's been a long time since my mother's experience in childhood, and I've been able to talk to the self-governing body about what she's going through as a family.
"What is the role of the support circle in the development of the White House?" (Deputy Representative) opened a conference on 27 days in a city-owned city with a famous city of the same country to share the experiences and lessons of the floods.
Some 20 mothers in their children thought about the form of family defenses, and they expressed a desire for self-governing.
Mr. Benshai of the north of the city of Zhao-ho, (32) said that three-year-olds who wanted the shelter had not gone to the shelter immediately after the water strike and had become drunk at night.
"Because the adults didn't have enough time to take care of the house," he went back and said, "the adults didn't wake up and they wanted to make sure they could say 'all right' to their children."
The majority of the city of Whitestone (36) spent one night in the city's office with 4 families with 3-year-old children.
"If there's a child who can't stay, he'll use his attention around."
From the age of 4, women (45) from the city centre where there are five children aged 2 to 45 were immersed in water around the house.
"You can't get away with five people," he says, "and he's going to spend as much time in his home as he can in times of disaster.
"It's not right to prepare for the change in family composition and living conditions."
Mr. Whitestone, who has six and eight-year-old children, suggested, "The primary school had e-mails in the past day, but there's no connection to the network and the e-mail system, if there's a mail delivery system."
I also wanted a system structure that could share the water supply in realtime.
Mr. River said, "Before the sky has changed, I didn't know how to say, 'It was all right last time.'
The representative in the field said, "I think I'm going to report it to the administration as a group."
Boris Johnson and women's executives, Jennifer Akuri, take care of the police.
The IOPC will then examine whether President Johnson should investigate whether the crime in the city of London is a criminal offence.
In a statement by the London Administrative Board (GLA), Mr. Akuri said that he had been asked to take advantage of his friendship with the Prime Minister, and that GLA's supervisor had recorded the Prime Minister's "actions" thing.
"The "actions" will be available if there is information indicating that there is a possibility that crime has been committed."
It's not just that this has never been proved.
IOPC will examine this.
This issue was addressed to IOPC, but IOPC is an agency that responds to reports from the police of England and Wales.
The problem was that Mr. Johnson was in charge of the police surveillance.
Mr. Johnson denied the wrongs associated with Mr. Ackerley's relationship.
First of all, Mr. Johnson said he was going to follow the order of the London Parliament asking for detailed information about Mr. Ackerley's relationship.
The statement received a report from Sandtimes, but it seems that he was given a three-fold chance of participating in a foreign trade union with Johnson in London, which he had moved to London seven years ago.
Since then, the government has spent 100,000 pounds of aid to Hackerhouse in the company of Archipelago in the investigation.
The company will be asked questions about the investigation process before the aid is paid.
Mr. Matt Werman, Prime Minister of the Digital Province, went to the bottom of the hall and said that the company owned the English phone number.
However, according to a number of reports, the phone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Akuri (34) is currently on the ground.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and female executives was "the secret between the employees."
GLA's move to charge the Prime Minister with police surveillance was provoked by the anger of the Prime Minister.
The government officials say it's a "political attack" and the timing of the party meeting last night was "very much party strategy".
"In any case, the supervisory agency did not provide any evidence, nor was the Prime Minister given the opportunity to respond to the supervisory authority in advance of a press release late on Friday evening."
The people and the Mascomi will see a lot of the political crazy language that they've been working on since.
First of all, the standard newspaper has heard that the relationship between London's intelligence and regional motivationian Johnson and California's employees was "public secret".
Despite the fact that Mr. Ackerley was considered to be a "trustworthy" company, London's former employees said that he wanted to have the privilege of accompanying a conference of trade unions outside the former city of Johnson.
The security fund used by the general population to produce property!
This is the 20th anniversary of the "Moningster" - Yahoo! News
I've just heard from the representative of the President of the Board of Directors of Investigation (photo) the following view.
- "All right, Fand," we got 20 years since our appointment in August this year.
What's going on over 20 years now?
First of all, in 20 years of history, there's been a lot of thought and effort.
I would like to express my deep appreciation to all the people involved, not only for their history, but also for their strengths.
I'm still standing up for the idea of "supporting the production of ordinary people."
This spirit has not changed. I've been looking stupidly for 20 years.
When the generals are relieved of the insecurity of money, they are encouraged to work day by day, thinking that the world will emerge from its foundations.
For a long time, it doesn't make sense that transport doesn't go along with the beneficiaries.
There's a lot of money in the "know-Found" at a time when you're going to lose your mind and you're going to lose your mind.
We feel that we understand the message that we have been asking for from day to day.
That's why it's been a 20-year long fund, and it's still a direct system that sends the message directly.
In the last report of the month, all investment companies, money and costs have been opened.
The information about what you're buying now is in the Blackbox, but the "Well, it's a fund" has all been shown.
This is the only reason I've trusted you.
Mac Miller's death, the three-eye drug arrester's key.
In a drug crime involving Mr. Mac Miller of Lapper last year who died of drug abuse, three men were arrested.
According to the case-law record, Stephen Walter was suspected that Mr. Miller had taken cocaine, alcohol, and fentanyl wrong before his death last September, and that he sold the opioid drug that had been incorporated into the oxycodon, but Fentanyl was a powerful opioid drug that had spread to thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of selling drugs to Mr. Miller for another person's drug supply to Cameron Petit.
According to a court record published on Tuesday, Petit was using Walter's drugs during August.
Ryan Lewis, who was arrested earlier this week in Reykhabascity, Arizona, was questioned about the fact that he had given Petit drugs as a "partner" in Walter's office.
Three people are not directly responsible for the deaths of Mr. Miller, but are still protesting about each case.
Walter, who is currently in detention, has been in custody for five months because he was in custody on a drug case in 2005.
The prosecutors who handled this item first reported by the Celebs site TMZ on Monday ask that Walter be detained until the trial begins because of the high likelihood of foreign refugees.
I didn't respond immediately to a phone message from the lawyer.
Petit is accused at the federal court on 4 September, but the lawyer refuses to comment.
Milar's song has been followed by a direct statement on the use of alcohol and drugs, and he has also won fans as one of the biggest players in hip hops.
Milar from Pittzburg, whose name is Malcolm James Mayers Macomick, had been in contact with singer Ariana Grande for two years, but he was broken up early in 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande wrote her favorite Miller movie on her own instaggram and published a love song about Miller, called "Sanku Next".
Miller is also one of the musicians who died from opioid drug abuse in recent years.
Lockband3Doors Down's guitarist masseuse Roberts died of drug abuse in 2016 and found in the body fentanyl and hydrocodon.
In this article, the name of Walter was not Steven and Stephen.
Nine-year-old in Nigeria. More than 30 mobile games developed.
This nine-year-old girl is using a free program application called Scratch2 and is making a game.
If you use Scratch2, you can make games, animations, stories in online mode.
So far, Bazill has built more than 30 mobile games using this app.
Today's game is a game that has been programmed to hidecomori.
The player gets the point when he captures the comoly from the hidden place.
I learned how to build a game in a short time.
He told CNN, "You're wasting your time playing when you're down."
In March, my father asked for a short five-to-five-year-old talk.
This lecture of the Codefest International Masters led to opportunities for robotic industries and new technologies such as Bazil.
According to his father's Bazil Okpara Sinai, Bazil grew up in most mobile games.
"Bazill used to pick up a cell phone and play games and bought a tablet at the age of 4.
And my father spoke to CNN.
But because it's only a small game, I'm interested in making a seven-year-old Bazill game.
"One day I was making a tablet like that, but I was really dreaming about the game, and I was a little hungry."
And I said, "I'm always playing games, but how about I make myself a game to play with others?"
When I said that, I was angry, and I didn't think Bazill would really care."
Since then, a boy who was interested in learning how to build his game asked his parents to buy a laptop and to register at the first stage of the game.
Bazill, who wants to become a scientist in the future, has a name for his game.
One of the games, "Mosquit Mass" can be bought in Google Plasta.
The youth population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if it is the latest in Africa, young people such as Bazillis have the authority to take the lead.
Recently, two 12-year-olds in Nigeria have been created using the program code to create a robot that takes over the house.
In May, in the 2019 Lobofest Contest, the Garna's high school team, which was programmed for boxing and robotic programming, won the Acrobot.
Africa's investments in Google and microsoft large technology companies are increasing and children of the same age are becoming programmers.
Mr. Noscarolina's joint party member, who was convicted of fraud in the kidnapping investigation.
According to the court document submitted to the House, the President of the Anti-Noscarolina Co-Party is expected to admit that he has lied to federal investigators who have carried out an investigation into the main political donors.
In a case-by-case file at the Federal Court of Justice, Robin Hayes has been responsible for coming to the water on Sunday.
According to a document based on the fact that Heis's lawyer had signed the case, Heiss was aware that he was making false accusations against FBI Agents during the 2018 kidnapping investigation.
In fact, it is not known what kind of crime Heis would have committed.
Hayes was first told about the crime of fraud, fraud, and lying.
The investigation party reported that the House of Lords was involved in the plan of the insurance company's core function, which was intended to introduce the election award to the State's security supervisor on a visit to special treatment.
Two co-rapporteurs, Greg Lindberg, are told without delay to the chief security officer of Mike Kodzi.
Lindberg has been a security and investment company creator and has been contributing over $5 million to the state and federal electoral candidates and commissions since 2016 and has been the top political donor in the state in recent years.
Lindberg supported the common party's ideas and politicians, but he also contributed to the democratic party.
I didn't answer my question to Lindberg's lawyer, who asked for an e-mail comment.
On Friday, Hayes' lawyer, Carance Davis, asked for more comments by e-mail.
In a document submitted to the Golden Court, it was reported that Hayes had lied to FBI Agents in August 2018, but this time, Hayes did not talk to Kodje about the State Security Agency's staff.
However, according to a document based on fact, Hayes was actually talking about the personal negative dependence of State Security Officers and Lindberg on security.
The investigation party also said that Hayes had been able to help Lindberg's trust that he wanted to date, and that he had talked to the supervisor about the direct charge.
The complaint published in April claimed that Lindberg sought special treatment for its insurance services and claimed that it was intended to result in an election activity of $2 million in the year 2020 to target the election of the codje.
According to the case-law, this conspiracy involved the appointment of the authorities investigating Lindberg's company.
The Co-Party's codier reported the undisputed suspect to the federal agent and helped with the position.
There's no doubt in the case.
In the case of the prosecution, in a conversation including Lindberg and Kodzi, it is reported that Lindberg's co-existence instructed Heis to pay $250,000 for the re-election of the case.
According to the case-law, Hayes had initially argued that he would be paying such attention if he were to move so much money, but he ended up in the conversation.
In the case of prosecution, Hayes says, "Whatever you want to do."
"All right, I'll do it."
The reporter of the Federal Investigations has not responded to the request for detailed information on the e-mail on judicial negotiations.
Facebook, to improve user's happiness, well!
For the first time in the world that has brought us the happiness of the user, some of the users have not yet been able to see the number of people who have seen the video.
In July, the same test was started in Australia, and the same test was started. Well, it's not only personal use and the printer can be seen.
This new Facebook attempt is started on the gold market, and it's scheduled to start in Australia.
Mia Garrick, political leader of Facebook Australia, said that this change is based on the fedback of Mentalhers experts who seem to be the cause of social comparisons.
Garyk said, "There was a very positive feedback from the reaction group and the mentoring team."
Well, it's just to delete the numbers so that we can re-examine the content and content of the exchange rather than the number of distributions.
Garyk said that instead of feeling competitive, the user is expected to be more secure and able to share in this platform.
Garrick also claimed that businessmen who were making Facebook have access to the same metrics and websites.
In Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland, it has been a long time since they have carried out the same test.
The Facebook page plugin does not indicate when this test will end or when it will be changed.
"There was also an initial positive feedback on the test in the Instagram, but now listen to the feedback, and it's a level of learning," said Garrick.
The world's research country Garrick in Australia pointed out that Australia has a very positive "technology-encompassed" user of Facebook and Instagram.
He thought that Australia was a really good feedback country about whether it was a valuable experience for people or not.
Lagby W. "Miracle!"
"There's been a storm" on the big planet.
Even in large cities, there was a voice of joy in Japan's Great Silver Star.
A member of the association who was watching from outside monitors at the Grand Canal of Umminami, who was at the end of the day, said, "It's impossible to believe in the "Miracule."
"I thought I'd left because I had lost half my life."
A member of the board who was fighting in the nearby sportsbar near Doonton (37) was a social-based sociologist.

One day my mother took my favorite bag of money and went nowhere.
If you lose your favorite bag of money, you're gonna want to fix it and continue to use love.
I helped her with that, but it was a Canadian handbag.
"I don't know if I'm going to sell it anymore."
My mother's broken bag, it's a great piece of pizza.
So when we asked for repair in the hotel, it became a situation where the total price would go up.
My mother said, "I'm sorry about leaving, but I didn't want to.
I've been looking for something to replace this link.
It's just that there's a ring of gold, but it's all silver.
Gold didn't look very good.
I've finally found out where I'm going to the Candace!
I was impressed when I found it in the handcuff.
Now we're going to be 100, but we're going to have to do it.
It's like a part used for keyholder or cham DIY.
We're going to use one for both sides of the baghandler, and we're going to have two.
If we look at the size of the ring, we're going to make the same thing as the other side of the bag.
So there's a way to fix the bug.
I'll take it right away.
Ducky!
The Ling Open Office is a work that's broken in the inside, and it's very strong in the outside.
I've already got it in my bag.
The gold is good for the gold system, but it's a little bit too bad for the ring size.
So I'm thinking about it, and I'm going to double it.
And I'm going to say, I'm going to have a lot of money, but I'm not really in the middle of it.
Instead, we're going to have a lot of circulatory particles, and we're going to notice that we're going to have a design level.
"Asu" on the highway from the state's emergency station.
We're waiting for the JR to be released on the island of JR and we're going to have an emergency "Asu" race of 28 days.
People who enjoy the journey of a car that depicts the "Assus" race in the time of the national era are 28 days.
In the 28th century, when we imagine the urgent "Assus", the train was run in the middle of the island.
On the same morning, about 240 people from the island traveled in the blue "2 customer cars" last year, leaving about 0 hours on their way to the Red Sea.

Mr. Candile Baroque, SNSster, Pakistan, was finally detained by his brother.
Mr. Candile Baroque, who was named after a photo of the social media, was murdered in July 2016.
In Pakistan's social media character, Candile Baroque's brother was found guilty of murder on Friday, the murder of his sister, and he was sentenced to eternal death in Pakistan, where his father's country was the most noted.
A few things have been done on the basis of recent self-sustainment, but women's vision is very strong in Pakistan, and a famous Baroque was killed in July 2016.
My brother Muhammad Wesheim was arrested.
He said, "Of course he killed her, but her actions were "not allowed," and he didn't regret what he did.
Mr. Salder Memoud, a fellow lawyer, told the AFP that the court in the city of Mortan in the east of the city of Morton had sentenced Vassim to death in a pending trial.
"Insharler will be innocent in the Supreme Court," said the attorney.
First of all, Mr. Baroque's mother, Anwar May, told AFP that he wanted his son to be innocent.
"There is no blame on the son.
My daughter and my son."
Mr. Barotochi's murder has become a news issue in the world, and as he has seen the root of his father's society, there is still a voice calling for action against the spread of the so-called 'emergency killer' by the victims, such as women.
In the case of a woman who chose her own marriage mate, Mr. Ebarlochi, she was shot, shot or killed for crimes such as rape, murder or murder.
The murder will be carried out by close relatives who want to kill.
Then, by means of Pakistan's Kisers and Diya's law, the victim can apologize to the victim's relatives.
Three months after Mr. Baroque's death, the Parliament passed a new bill which imposed the death penalty on the perpetrators.
However, the fact that the murder is a shameful crime is based on the judgment of the judge, and the killer can claim another motive on the theory and possibly be forgiven.
In Mr. Baroque's case, the first parents said they wouldn't forgive their son.
But the parents who thought they'd lose their son said that they'd change their mind and want to forgive him.
With international hatred for murder, the Government of Pakistan has taken an unprecedented approach to declaring it to be a successor to both parents and countries, but the complaint has continued.
Mr. Baroque's well-known actions include the announcement of a strip show to the Pakistani team and the use of a very red dress that was widely used by the Balentinde.
While criticism and pressure have been intense, many young people have been recognized by people who have been involved in what they consider to be a political activity that promotes the status of women, such as Kim Cardassian.

The site is a small lake (400) in the spring (500 in the Cannaboxes 2ki in the spring) (300 in the Cannabox 1 in the autumn) and is a self-governing area (400 in the Sunnabox 2 in the autumn).
When the tsunami struck, many of the inhabitants of the coastal part of Japan were warned of Zimbabwe and fled.
He fled to a refugee camp, which was set up in the capital.
Most of the refugees were unable to move their homes to two shelters where there were no shelters, and many of the shelters were heard to complain of hunger for one time.
In order to prepare for the same disaster, the response to the drought and the storm was one of the problems.
It's a set of things that can cover the whole body when it's away.

In fact, he's been thinking about "moté" as a brain scientist.
I've used my own great knowledge and new knowledge of the amazing "scientific theory."
I'll send you a copy of this.
In the premise (reference to related articles), Otco, who drank too much of his own practice of maturing into the following type of "man's imagination" and his own tastes!
I've been talking about how to become a dead man.
I'll live when I'm done with it.
I've always developed "Caco" in front of me, and I've talked about the need to learn every day about different things and people's personality.
If you learn about pattern, you're going to have to do this right now and you're going to be able to get your brain to process your actions so you can live in the lab.
I don't think I'm going to die.
That's why it's worth living.
I've been teaching in the East and Tokyo, so I've had a lot of conversations with young people, and I've learned a lot of patterns with them.
But if it's where you're going to be at the university professor's position, it might be a little harder if you're going to say, "I'm going to be more at risk of being a university teacher."
I don't know why, so I'm happy every day.
We'll live when we say, "This is what we should do."
So if you don't change, you're gonna change people and society.
But I recently spoke to them about something similar in the book “No Life in a Troubled World. ”
It's natural to recognize that person and say, "Response" and "authority."
I don't think it's a joke.
It's hard to ask around you.
I'm sorry. I didn't make a comedy at Canton.
I'm going to treat myself as a "beautiful film overseer."
You don't really have to look like a real person.
I mean, it doesn't make any sense that it's called "light."
As far as I've heard of a number of women, it's like no position or age, no man is "good."
It's hard to say, "That's good."
It's like, "Good Ojay."
The number of refugees increased by 40,000 in the north-western part of Nigeria in the illegal situation: the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees in the United Nations Office for Refugees (UNHCR)
According to the United Nations statement on Friday, the number of refugees from northern Nigeria has increased by about 40,000 over the past four months.
According to the U.S. National Refugees Organization, the "new human crisis" has been created by this conflict, and it will require a new $35.5 million fund-raising activity by the end of this year.
UNHCR’s Bever Baroque journalist said that the recent multiple armed attacks of the Islamic organization Bocoharam, which has been active in northern Nigeria for 10 years, are not relevant.
On the contrary, violence has been organized by armed groups that have been active in the state of Socot, Samfara, and Katzina over the past 10 months.
"The fear of the state of illegality and insecurity is well expressed," the blogger told the reporter on Friday.
The reporter said that kidnappings, interrogations, rapes, murder and sexual violence were frequent and that attackers destroyed their homes and stole their jobs.
The military and the police are also being sent to the local criminal organization.
But the military is struggling with the war against the West African branch of the Islamic State, which was separated from the old organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't have to name the group," said Mr. Baroque.
What they're carrying is a terrible physical experience.
Most refugees are moving to neighboring Nigeria.
UNHCR stated that, particularly in the Soviet State, the situation of security has deteriorated, and that refugees who move to Nigeria have increased their prospects over the next few months.
A new trial date for a man who killed two women and children.
A trial date for the Guatemalan man who was murdered by a woman in Iowa and her two children.
According to the records of the Pork Court of Justice, Marvin Escobal Oleana (31) was charged with the first murder in three of the cases that took place on behalf of the former police, named Marvin Escibel Lopes.
He claims to be innocent.
According to the police, on 16 July at the house of the demon, he killed Mr. Rosives Flores Rodrigues (29), her daughter (11) and her son (5).
In the court's record, it will be given time to prepare the case-laws for another trial date on 27 May.
According to the authorities of the American Immigration Tax Agency, Escobar Orelana was illegal in the United States and was sent to the United States twice before the gun.
In 2010, he was convicted of crimes in the United States of America.
The Sonnet Media Networks (hereinafter referred to as SMN) launched a press release on "Logicad for Publishers" (hereinafter "LFP") by Prebid.js.
The LFP is a service to buy its own advertising and to carry out its planning.
This service provides an effective release of DSP "Logicad" through media contacts.
Hederbyding is a team that can give priority to high-quality advertising on the media run by the media in order to engage in fair competition in multiple bidders (proposal companies).
As a solution that can be expected to improve transparency for media companies, large-scale media is moving towards the centre.
So far, "Logicad" has provided SSPs about advertising.
In recent years, in order to respond to the desire of the advertiser to "the desire of the parentality of individual commercials and brandy to make a commitment to certain advertising," LFP began by connecting the media to the media, directly buying advertising that the advertiser wanted.
This time, in response to headbyding, LFP's leadership will be complemented.
As the promoter, Merrit, it is possible to participate in the promotion of direct leadership by responding to LFP’s headwardings, which can be looked forward to the promotional opportunities.
And since the media are limited, it also ensures that certain commercial materials and brandy-based advertising is used to prevent brand-value damage.
As a media company to Merit, LFP is encouraged to be able to build up the media company's hope of entering into the media through a solution that holds the code called "wrapper" so-called "Wrapper" solutions.
It's a small business product. It's got Zetro's support. It's online.
Jetro, Japan's mobile power plant, has been working to support the expansion of small businesses through the Internet.
We set up Japan's special conner in the outer sea, and we offer products from all over the world, and we try to sell them directly to consumers outside the sea.
Business demands are more than thousands of companies, and they're increasing performance in China and South-East Asia.
"JAPAN MALL" began last year.
The main purpose of small businesses that do not have access to the sea is to prevent world events such as cooking, drinking, and processing.
It's possible that Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, which is connected with Jethro, could be sold on 24 large hand sites.
In Pawahara, the 30-year-old M.A.
As there was such a threat to students as Pawahara, the mountain range declared that on 27 days, 30-year-old male assistants who worked in the Mekampas (U.S.) were stopped for 2 months.
It's the same day.
According to the Department of Public Services, male assistants have been able to re-inject a number of students belonging to the study room since October 2017 and have been able to repeat the threatening words that fall short of proper words and give strong stress.
I've found it to be Pawahara, which has damaged the educational environment.
There was a complaint from a number of students in the survey that was conducted on September 18.
In addition to speaking to students and assistants from the Department of Industry, since December of the same year, Halasment has been conducting an investigation in the Committee on the Prevention of Responses by the teachers of the Mitzcampas, and has finally filed a request for Halasment from one of the students.
As a result of an investigation by the Co-Commission, he decided to hold a hearing with the head of the school and the staff of the board of directors.
And after Anckett, men's education continued to grow, but his actions have been improved through interviews and he himself says "I didn't apologize."
The student said, "I'm going to bring the victim to the front, and I'm going to take care of the entire school and try to restore confidence."
In the same year, male teachers of the Ministry of Industry have also continued their internal research into what there is doubt about sex-related behaviour among girls who are led by male teachers at the Ministry of Industry and who are able to publish a report if they are part of the trial.
To reduce the demand for EU withdrawal from the internal rebellion and to link with the EU, Mr. Boris Johnson asked Mr. Sa San.
Now that it's only three weeks before the EU summit that will take place, the idea is that the Prime Minister will not be able to take any major steps.
Mr. Boris Johnson is faced with internal riots seeking to link with the EU by withdrawing the EU's withdrawal request.
A new system of tax-related taxes that is replaced by the backstop item on Ireland's borders, the EU considers Mr. Johnson's case to be "impossible".
The senior ministers are expecting the EU's black screens, which are ranked by British Prime Minister Angela Melkel of Germany, to propose a three-year time limit for the rear end of the security party to the head of this post.
After the last year of the Conservative Party, which was held in Manchester, Sa Sanja heard a conversation with the Prime Minister.
They're asking the Prime Minister to give up the "extraordinary" strategy to threaten the EU, which he proposed by the Prime Minister, Dominic Kamings, and claim that the EU will receive a request over time.
One of the speakers said that the decision to shut down the parliamentary meeting on Friday was illegal, and in the present case, "the only way we can leave on "3 July".
And We shall not be victorious in the Sublime. They are the ones who oppose Us.
The Prime Minister must use what he can use rather than walk.
It doesn't work, even if it's overexploited, and Kamings' plans are obviously failing.
It's not enough to fight in so many areas.
The other officer, however, promised to speak to Mr. Johnson to carry out the former Prime Minister's agreement.
The senior minister said, "If necessary, I'm going to tell Boris I'm going to go back to my office to get the Teriza deal back."
That's why there's so much going on, and nobody's trying to end it at all.
If we don't delay, Boris is over, and we're all over.
John Major accused Boris of not seriously considering the deal.
The former president of the Conservative Party said to us, "The Prime Minister wants us to agree with the EU.
But we do not see the fact that the Prime Minister is at a meeting with the EU and that he will create an agreement.
Instead, we have seen that the Prime Minister in Scotland fought with cattle, investigated the cows in Wales, and discussed mostly with the national.
The Prime Minister admitted yesterday that the agreement was still in progress, "If anyone fails to reach a goal that has no mind, the road is still longer."
However, when the reporters left, when they did not agree, a three-month extension of the Benin Act said in Brussels, "the position of our communication is very weak."
The journalist said, "It is no mistake that this bill impedes our communication, but the Prime Minister and its colleagues are trying to continue their efforts despite the fact that they have created it and are trying to make progress."
The United States of Europe will return to Brussels today for the EU's compromise with Michel Barnie.
They will discuss a paper on how the regulation of the whole island of Ireland works in terms of food and livestock.
Lorain, Kelly, I said that the glass goose will never succeed in a television world.
Lorain, Kelly found out that in that garage, he was told by the TV bosses that he'd never make it.
And before I started on television, I said, "It's very tense," and 59-year-old Kelly went back 35 years in the shipping industry.
"I'm still 25 years old, I'm very nervous," she says.
I was working as an investigator at the BBC's Scotland office, and I was told that your boss was never successful in the television industry.
I went to London to meet all the TV-am teams before I left for the Glasgow office, and to see if the show was being delivered.
I'll never forget that Korean diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing the story's woman Ubetty Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as I was alive.
I knew where I wanted to be.
Kelly started to work as a local journalist in East Cleveland, Scotland, "in 984 she became a journalist at the TV-Amscotland office.
Kelly also served as a director of the program, such as GMTV and ITV's break-up and demobrick, and then started to give Lorein her name.
I remember 35 years, and I'll send you a special program to turn over and over to Kelly's most remembered place and interview.
"Love and zeal" and "requirement" were the secret to stay alive in the television industry, and the manager added, "You have to get it to work."
You must be honest and honest.
To do what we should do, to be interested in other people and to be interested in them.
Reminiscent of the news that had hit the heart, Kelly found that it was "very hard" to deal with the Dumbleen shooting incident.
"We didn't even think that many of the families of the children who were killed or injured were going to be released from Dunbreen on the terrible day of the murder of six students and Mr.
I'm a mother's man, and my five-year-old daughter, Joanna, said that Rose wanted to see me personally, so we got to talk to her at home for hours.
I'm going to Joanna's funeral, and Pam and I've been friends ever since.
Kelly also interviewed her husband when Kate and Gary McCann's daughter, Madeleine, were missing in 2007, but she said, "It was very expensive," and she said, "I really respect her strength and courage."
A wife needs to be patient with a network that doesn't know what's going on with her beloved daughter.
My wife's not really a poison.
The 35th anniversary of Lorain will be broadcast from 8 a.m. to 30 a.m. on Monday, September 30th.
Ginbabe. Chechenga scared the bear.
According to the senior government officer, Vice-President Konstantino Chechenga rejected the presidential statement of former President Dellobert Mugaba in his political change, which may have been a cause of concern for the military action in November 2017.
As Mgabe continued to negotiate with the National Defence Forces between the codator, Mgabe claimed that he was taking the presidential office in Chienga, reports the Zimbabweindependent newspaper last week.
However, the reason that Chienga has rejected the offer is, not disturbingly, that it is the government's intention to use Chengabe to inform the world's leaders and the African Union that he has been deprived of his power by the codéter, and that the government officials are reporting on social media.
In one of Jamanda2's tweets, the authorities confirmed that he was a senior member of the President's Office, "Mugababe, who has been in power for 37 years, is not going to take over the government in Chechengawa," and it is reported that there was a strong communication about this.
Mgabe, who realized that he was losing power, made contact with the messenger in Chechenga, when the government authorities were speaking.
According to the senior government officer, because of the military command, the former President's arbitration was conducted by three.
The senior officer reported that George Charanba of President Spokesman, Aaron Nepela of the then central information agency, and Pope Fidelis M'Conori of the Roman Catholic Division, had engaged in the transaction.
Gideon Gono of the Zimbabwe Banking Board is one who has been assigned from Mugabe to report only to the Chief of Staff of the Zimbabwe Defence (ZDF) Commander Chienga.
Mugabe, who became a symbol of Africa more than ever after his death, failed to challenge the military action of the African Union to seek an intervention by the leaders of African countries.
The presidential election of the former President (Mgababe) was not the case.
"That's why some of the President's family started to get tired and left themselves behind to save the situation so quickly," writes the senior officer, Jamanda.
I just wanted to change the flow, at least for diplomatic reasons, so there was little political turmoil in the President.
If it was like to break the law order, it was about the African Union's view and controversy about the coder, but I would like to remind you that the commanders had declared that they did not break the law order, nor did they want to break it.
So the President (Mugabé) was expecting the commanders who claimed that Chewenga was a military top at the time and that he did not break the law order.
Therefore, the President (Mugababe) wanted the African Union, which decided to place the whole situation as a codator without being able to handle it properly, not as a codator, but as a result of its call for military intervention.
But it was a plan based on this proposal.
When they realized they were not protected by the defence, Mgabe was moved, the authorities said.
He was warned that he would be punished like Cadafi and that Mgabe was unable to write his resignation.
The military commanders told Mugabe that although they would enter the President's house called Blulf, they would not shoot the citizens.
At the same time, Mgabee said he wanted to protect his family and prove his authority by the military.
At the time, the commanders and the commanders had read the plan correctly.
In the words of the President's Deathly Prophet (Gono), "I'm Tili Bemakwap Makwupa (we belong to Kamofraju and military) and we're not only in political competition if we're not politicians," the High Commissioner said.
The Army told the local military commanders that they were using the soldiers who were stationed in Zimbabwe and that the aim was not to break the mgabe, but to remove the "crimes" who would take him away.
And Mgabe tried to call back the same way as Mongagua, who had recently died in South Africa in order to talk about the Kurddeter and the latter.
In addition to the military's engagement, Mgabe needed support from the area.
Since the President of the South African Development Community at the time was the President of the South African Development Community, the South Africans, who were the key to this process, had refused to intervene, and had repeatedly threatened to enter the President's house, made it clear that the South African army had been sent directly to Haraleh.
"But it didn't really happen because it wasn't supported by President Putin and Africa's leaders," the information tells Indian newspaper.
In the United States, the two worlds have been charged with nuclear bans, and the treaty has been ratified by 32 Canadians.
At the UN headquarters in New York on 26 days, a meeting of non-nuclear-weapon-free worlds opened, with a talk by the President of the Red Cross Hospital (now the Red Cross and Apostasy) on the occasion of the explosion, with the support of the nuclear-weapon-free treaty.
The new five countries have ratified the nuclear ban treaty today, and it has become 32 Canadians' territory.
We need 50 countries' ratifications to be implemented.
The meeting and ratification took place in conjunction with the International Day for the Total Explosion of Nuclear Weapons, which the United Nations established on 26 days.
The President of the Gothéres also spoke and expressed strong concern about the recent years of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
I emphasized, "It's not going to end."
China's strong leadership is not necessary, but it's a policy paper.
China needs strong leadership by the Communist Party, and it will rather be "lost" when the People's Republic of China first remembers the 70th anniversary of the construction of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese Government mentioned in the policy paper published on Friday.
In a White Paper, China's National Press Office said that success was based on party leadership 70 years ago by the Communist Party.
China is large and its internal circumstances are complex, but most of the problems of governance are not seen.
If there is no strong leadership, China will be going to break up and collapse, and it will be a terrible thing in the world."
China's authorities have been justified for a long time to deal with problems in a strong way like the 989 democratic movement in Beijing.
A powerfully-fledged national president of the world's 2nd World Economic Summit, who has been in charge of the World Economic Summit, has been strengthening the party's power since late 2012.
The customs officer has also overseen the modern program of the army that threatens the area.
The policy paper says that China is not trying to export its development models, nor is it going to take them into other countries, but rather seeking peace instead of power.
Among the descendants of Chinese peoples, there is no aggression or world power.
In recent times, China has suffered from fatigue, and war and confusion have left its suffering to a deep extent; it will never be able to bring the pain it has experienced to others.
China has not been involved in a serious civil war with the United States for years when its home is insecure, and is facing a difficult problem such as low vision and anti-government movement in Hong Kong.
The White Paper says that China will never give up its core interests and will not allow security and sovereignty to be destroyed.
"There is no problem with the continuing tax on the threat of civil war," says the White Paper on the dispute with Washington.
China is a developed country with a complete industrial chain, a broad market space and a strong economic development.
"I will never weaken in the light of war."
I am convinced that China will face difficulties, turn the crisis into a chance and open a new world.
China doesn't really think it's against the United States, and I don't think it's going to replace the United States, so America should slow down China's development.
America can't control China, and it's less likely to stop China's development.
If we control other countries, force them, and make them move out of the country, the United States will not maintain its strength.

In the summer, the name and height of the high-school boar, which celebrated the 5th national structure, announced 28 days that he had paid off the same amount as the Minister of Peace (36) and the Prime Minister of China (42).
The Minister (responsive teacher) is going to be taking over the high school and is going to decide soon.
On 26 days, the Prime Minister of the Peace and the Prime Minister reported that the local paper had been abusive to the Department of the Environment.
When the school board heard of two of them, the chief of police took the lead in the students, and the Prime Minister recognized part of the abuse.
I heard from 66 other students, and I got the results of the investigation, and I got back to two people again, and I got fired for 28 days to admit that I'm sorry.

Mel C of the spasgars, who suffered from eating disorders in the family, banned Diet's speech.
Melanie Chizom, of Spaisgarz, admitted that the family is banning diets from eating only fruits and vegetables for many years.
Sports space, under the president of the world's pop group, has continued to "exsize until too long" without food for many years, and then has been diagnosed with food shortages.
Chisham said his experience was also affecting the baby's beloved Scarlett, saying, "It's forbidden to talk about diet in the family."
"Scarlet is now 10 years old, and it's become a matter of attention to her appearance," says Mel.
But because of the food shortages, I was very interested in the delivery of my words when I was talking to this girl.
It's a tradition.
In the 1990s, who was known as a member of Spaisgars, when the "bad" comment that was written in Moscow before the head of the SNS, came into focus on the problem of the body, Mel spoke in an interview by Women's Health magazine.
"I didn't see my face very much in my own life, and it was as if I had taken some food, taken it to the size of my hair, and it was as if it were too big."
I've been in a lot of trouble, and I've been in this situation for years.
I'm going to go to the North Sea Newspapers, and I'm going to have to tell you what I'm doing with the TV.
In a complaint that the "real marriage" that was prepared for marriage would also be created during the same period, the District Court of the District Court decided to accept this.
There are more than 20 countries that recognize same-sex marriages, and there is no legal force in the country, but self-government is a system that supports the same-sex partnership.
The court did this and found out that two women were married.
The first court ruling that recognized the legal protection of the same sex cappelt is valid.
The failure to recognize the rules of civil law and of abortion for reasons of homosexuality is a complaint against the State that claims to damage it are made in five jurisdictions, such as prostitution.
I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights of the sex minority and deepen my discussion of the legal system that recognizes many families.
Women have lived together for some 7 years and have also obtained marriage certificates in the United States, but have been destroyed by an act of misconduct, and the prosecutor has asked for damage to former partners.
The court found that "the reality of the marriage of men and women has nothing to change" from the fact that two people are related to each other.
The definition of the right to marriage as a social security measure is a formal decision that extends to the same sex.
What's more important is the interpretation of article 24 of the Constitution, which defines marriage as "freedom of marriage on the basis of sexual consent."
It's a two-way relationship because it wasn't designed to be sex, and it's not even for the purpose of rejecting homosexuality.
"The law of abortion doesn't mean the same marriage," and it's expected to be a follow-up of the same sex marriage in all the world.
On the other hand, because same-sex marriages are not recognized, it is still the problem of reducing abortions because "the benefits of legal protection between men and women" are not recognized.
It is not possible for men and women to break the right to protect while recognizing the same reality as men and women.
In an investigation into the national family movement for older married women and the legal recognition of same-sex marriages, the conscience of the national population is also changing.
As life-style diversity progresses, the law is attached to traditional family images, which will take away the rights of people who do not.
In fact, marriage is not recognized as a "partner" by the law, but it is not treated in tax systems, and it is still a little less restricted than it has common family rights.
In the context of the same marriage, it is important to look at family law from different perspectives, such as the expansion of the right to a true marriage.
The trial of several women who were accused of being accused of being guilty of multiple forms of sexual harassment.
The trial is conducted by counseling members of a law firm at the University of Delaware, which is accused of having committed sexual abuse against several women.
"On Friday, when the witness and the debate ended in 0 days, the attorney began a debate on the fate of Clay Conway (23).
A woman named 2 says she was sexually abused after driving Conway into her home.
The two of them shared their faces, and they knew each other at the site of the meeting three weeks later, when Conway sent his picture of the wedding to a woman.
Conway has been questioned for six sex crimes against women between the ages of 20 and three and eight, but this woman is also one of them.
The investigation party claimed that she opposed when her consent was escalated and Conway tried to rape women.
The prosecutor said that she had followed women's conflicting claims and memories and that she had regretted having physical relations.

It's a very serious pollution of the Earth. It's obvious in the movies.
In Australia's annual economic economy of $210.9 million, the Sydney Harbor is the largest hub of the Operahouse, the Security Key, the Lunapark, and the famous Harbor Bridge.
But there's the truth under the bridge.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, where about 15 tons of pollutants flow into the Olympics every year.
One of our greatest sights is one of the most unclean places in the world, because of this statistics.
According to a new film titled "Sidney Harbor", the most popular city in Australia is the waterway around the city.
It's plastic.
In a film released on 27 September of the World Vision, Dr. Catherine Duffon, Vice-President of the Sydney Harbor Research Programme, says, "This is a paradox."
It's really beautiful, but it's one of the rivers that have been transformed and contaminated within our country's coastal borders.
According to CSIRO, plastics of 1560 kilograms are considered to be flown into the water every day, most of which are flown into the Sydney Harbor.
"How many times did the terrible rain fall, but the Sydney Harbor was... terrible," said Dr. Duffon.
Two thirds of the pollution flows from the water that flows through the road.
But as part of the mountain range, the larger problem is that 70 percent of the plastics that flow into the sea under this Sydney Harbor water are collected at sea.
"I don't really think I know what's going on in there," said Dibsenter Manley, who said, "I'm only going to collect about 500 kilograms of plastic a year from his team.
If most people know what's under the water, they think they're really going to get bored.
But more than half of all the things we've discovered are binary bags.
At least half of the remaining plastics are used anywhere.
No one can believe that all these plastics and jewelry are coming under the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of the designers of the Osan Protect, said that there are ways to reduce the plastics and paints that flow into the water and also to allow local residents and visitors to see.
"We should start from the source," he says.
We're going to reduce the use of plastics, we're going to get better and we're finally going to get to the sea, so we don't have to be more aware of what's going on in the exhaust water.
The 50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so it's going to kill us.
The ocean is absorbing 30 percent of carbon dioxide, and it's a source of food.
But we're going to repair Sydney Harbor and return it to the old side, but it's very simple.
To kill the sea is to kill people.
A new study on plastic and Mentalhers was published this month, along with the opening of this film by Tomra of the Riciculian Society, as part of a widely known activity to protect the environment and the effects of alcohol on the environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of children between 12 and 18 years of age and between 8 and 546 are depressed about plastics, and 25 percent think they are using plastics because of adults.
In the same study, as well as for parents, plastic issues were listed in section 4, and 93 percent of the 551 surveyed were concerned about the amount of plastic acid that had flowed into the sea.
Most of the researchers said they wanted something about plastics, but they didn't know what to do to change it, and it was like an eco-injury.
From October onwards, the D.C.A. has been working on it since the end of the year.
"The smoke from the old Donovan power plant, which began in October, is 2nd in the city of Donzi.
On 26 May, the State Power announced that it would launch an anti-done power plant (oil power) in the city of Donzin.

In the plan, it's 9 months for each division, and it's 8 months.
There's no time for the rest of the turbine building and the sailor to be destroyed.
There's also a sad voice, and a 60-year-old man who's near the restaurant says, "When you look back and see the smoke, it's like a symbol that makes you feel like you're back in the shower.

It's like selling goods in local fish.
[Fishnaget and Tai's students are at the end of the city's old village.]
[Laughing] Four years ago, four of the top-class businessmen of the three-year-old high-school news store in the city of Old Town have developed fishing nets in Fijigett and Thai.
He was sold as a cultural priest on 26 days.
It is part of the local industry in the East City region, which is active in water industry and forestry, and is one of the three major universities in the East Bank.
The developed goods were introduced to the physhunagets that used the hair of the cattle caught in the wild, and the roots used to grow the soil.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Fishnaget developed three types that added carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide.
There's a team of cattle companies working together in the city of Bourne.
It's been a long time since I've been in the middle of the day.
The Water Company of the End of the City is conducting a consultation on "the final product" of the "fishing" and "fishing" (with the old town of the city).
I've been working since June.
I've learned how to look at the plant of the pastry, and I've been able to understand the water industry.
I talked about consumer news at the workshop, and I tried to eat some work.
Naget, who used his ass, also thought about it, but he used his nose because he had a fish-like tail.
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I don't know what I'm going to say.
To sell the goods, they're dealing with the city's visual facilities.
That's why I've got my own CBC TV.
This time, CBC TV's "hangt" on Freetown spoke about your teacher.
The advice of the teacher who saved himself from being fucked up.
For me, it's more like a teacher than a father.
Although it's the same business, my father is very generous and I'm an Annanser.
What I'm doing is I'm going to tell you what's important as a social person.
When he was said to be a rabbit or a bug, he said, "I thought it was a rabbit, but I didn't think it was a rabbit.
And then, at the end of the year, when I went into the company, I said, "If you're an empty girl, you're good to anybody," and when I didn't want to do any work, I didn't want to do it.
I've learned a lot from my father's play.
Many people don't see me reading the news, but they're actually on TV and they're on the news.
I thought it was going to come out when I read the originals of the news, and I thought that Mr. Macco Delaxes had appreciated "the real news reading is good," and I was happy, and I became convinced.
When I read the news, I feel like I'm great, and I feel it's a sense.
I've developed by watching my father's stage, movies, television, and time shows in my childhood.
In other words, what we're doing and how we're dealing with in the Balaetie are living with experiences such as childhood, I think it's because of my father.
A 300-year-old history/educated general work, the newspaper Home Page - The most popular news on the island of Kungou!
Workshops in the mirror
I'm going to go to high school on 26 days, where I'm talking about the role and effect of the five instruments played by the team.
The group workshop, which was held on 26th of the 9th "Education of the University of Education", was held in the middle school.
All the students attended and learned about the effects of the musical instruments played and how to use their 300-year history and life.
In the workshop, the OB member of the University of Apology presented the role of each of the players in the event of three lines, two lines, two lines, one too, and one side.
The Board of Directors worked with Mr. Chando of the OB Council on his departure from the island of Kungu.
In the workshop this time, I learned about how five types of instruments are shown in the dance, including three components of the group, music, and dance.
On the three lines, it was explained that it was an element of the movement of the hearts and emotions of the people coming up with the song.
The last half felt the excitement of the students when they actually touched the instrument and felt the sound of it.
It's designed to make many students more interested in "Catholic Music" by means of entertainment, and this is the first time in the past.

For over 10 years, WRC decided to start in Japan in November 2020!
The first news to start in the state of Ajay-Zao. - Yahoo! News
World War II (WRC) was held in Japan in November 2020.
The International Automobile Union (FIA) announced on 27 September 2019 that it will launch the "FIA World Elections (WRC) Japanese Round" on 22 November 2020.
Returns the WRC world election rights of the past!
(18th floor)
It was not the last time Japan's launch was launched on the North Sea in 2010.
What's the same thing as the resurrected WRC in 2020?
WRC is one of the four world electoral powers that the International Automobile Union (FIA) holds.
Since 1973 it has become the highest-ranking Lary of the world’s greatest electoral power in history and tradition, and not just the right (adhesive) to be closed, but also the right to run high-speed different roads, such as trains and snow roads.
In June 2018, Toyota returned to her 2nd session and won the 1999 WRC-manufacturing title and became a big issue.
This time, Japan's London's preparatory committee will open up to the tragedy of Japan.
As a result, the World Motor Sports Council, which is the largest resolution agency of the International Automobile Union (FIA), decided to launch the World Motorsports Council in 2020, will launch the WRC Japanese Round in 2020.
About Japan's launch, the knowledge of the love of knowledge and of Toyota GAZOO Racing WRT, the head of the Head of Head of State (The Toyota Automobile Service) is speaking as follows:
● Love of knowledge, Mr. Mayor of the village
"FIA World Elections (WRC) is warmly welcomed by Japan's 2020 launch of the World Elections (WRC).
● I'm aware of it, Mr. Oldman.
"In the year 2020 when the Tokyo Olympic Paralynpic Competition Conference was held, I am very pleased that the Japanese Round of the FIA World Elections is being held here in the 'clean country'.
● TOYOTA GAZOO Rating WRT Representative, Head of Head of State (Tiota Automobile Manager)
"I'm very sorry to let yarisWRC run in Japan.
I would like to ask you all for your support."
And about Japan's launch, many of the stakeholders, like the former Prime Minister, are commenting on the president of the Motor Sports Union.
The WRC World Cup will be held from 19 to 22 November 2020.

You're going to have a tasmania demon to treat cancer.
Tasmania Devel may have had cancer strains and may have opened up a potential breach that could lead to major reforms in patients' treatment.
Medical researchers have highlighted how some cancer cells come together.
Researchers have discovered that the same process is going on in Tasmaniadeville and Het.
In this study, new ways of treating cancer patients are being developed.
What's the common focus with Tasmania Deville and Het?
It's an invisible cancer cell.
A team of researchers at the Peter McCarham Cancer Center in Melbourne has found that if there is cancer that does not respond to treatment, there is a great chance of a major change in treatment for it.
There is also the possibility that you will have the key to the high face of death that threatens the future of the pre-destructive Tasmanian devil.
In this study, a group of cancer cells in both the liver and the pancreas were not responding to the market for the use of a number of strains called PRC2, and the immune system was not attacking the cancer.
This is a major problem with a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, nerve cells, and mercel cells.
Professor Mark Dawson of Peter McCarham said to AAP that "the most important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who show tolerance for the treatment of immunization."
The immune system may be able to detect cancer cells by re-use the following treatment, re-activating Marker, known as MHC.
"There is a possibility that there will be a major impact on lung cancer patients," said Professor Dosson.
"The lung cancer is a disease that spreads around the world.
And maybe you can get better treatment.
Researchers hope that this discovery will eventually be used in the treatment of the face cancer caused by the cancer cell, which is the same as that of the case where it escapes from consciousness.
"It's amazing that the same process will take place," said Professor Dosson.
"So far, it's been very difficult to treat Tasmaniana devil's wounds.
But if the drugs that have an effect on the liver can be used to tasmaniadevell, it may be possible to help control the liver."
Scientists are also confused about the vast planet around the super-small stars.
Scientists have discovered and amazed the solar system that covers the current understanding of the formation of planets that surrounds a tiny planet called the Red Star.
On September 26, 2019, the Great Gas Planet GJ3512b was released with an artificial image that revolves around the red star, which is its master.
It's usually bigger than the largest planet around it.
But in this case, there's no difference between the size of the stars and the planets.
The star called GJ3512 is about 12% of the sun, but the planet around it has at least half its size as our solar system's largest planet.
"Yes, it's still amazing." "The study published in Science magazine led by the naturalist of the Catholic University of the Spanish Universe, Frank Carlos Moreles.
The theoretical design model showed that the most common low-quality stars would be a small planet like the Earth and the little ocean planets, and this was surprising.
In this case, we found a huge gas planet like the sea, around a very small planet."
The planet, which is made up of gas as well as gas, was discovered using a telescope of the coloural sky in Spain.
The planet is about 204 days around the planet.
The red stars are smaller and relatively low in surface temperature.
GJ3512 is just about 35 percent larger than our solar system.
It's darker than the sun, and its surface temperature is about 3800 degrees Kelvin (6380 degrees Fahrenheit 3527 degrees Fahrenheit).
That's why I'm making red.
On one side of the planet's shape that the two planets are now orbiting the planet, and on the other hand, three planets have the possibility of being released from that planet's system in the past, explains its orbital orbital orbital orbit.
The planet is made up of the same planets that make up the planets around it.
In the most powerful planet model called the "co-collection" model, the object is made up of solid particles within the nucleus, and the surrounding atmosphere is impressed by the energy that the planet's wings produce.
This beautiful planetary system may be described by a self-contained model called a self-contained resistance model.
"If this is the case, the original planetary constellations that were only born may have been slightly larger and less warm than they were thought to be."
This is a situation where there's a security gap, so there's a possibility there's some high-speed area.
They're going to grow until they're destroyed and they're going to form planets.
Dely's agent, let's get him to the other side of the pool.
Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) is told that he has fed his partner a pair of wake-up pills.
Woodland and Orbani's Cassandra Ani Medina Hernández (38) have been accused of causing heavy-duty methamphetamine transmission and controlled drugs to others.
The suspect is due to an incident in the sheriff's food store in Jefferson on September 9th.
According to an estimate from OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to Delhi for dinner and asked her to take some fun to see that the Medina Hernández was building a dam.
According to the statement, the victim has not done methamphetamine yet, and says to the investigator, "I thought I'd have a different taste after I ate my eyes, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman got back to work, she had a bad leg.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, in the previous local hospital where a woman went, it was determined that there was a possibility that Metanfetamine was ingested into the lungs.
According to Mr. Smoking Ghan, another Sliftwei employee said that Mediana Hernandes said that the victim's food had been "injected" by the police, and three of his crew members said that the suspect had mistakenly introduced methofetamine into the lungs.
According to an article in Oregon, a surveillance video taken from Delhi says that Mediana Hernández is looking behind the camera and is taking something out of the Brazilians.
And then he got up and pulled his teeth up and walked up to the table, and he was put in a little paper bag of paper.
The police told me they had taken everything from Brajar on the roof.
According to the Oregon Stateman Journal, the security officer said that there are no people who are currently exposed to contaminated food.
Medina Hernández is held in Marion County Prison instead of $50,000.
According to Sa Smoking Ghan, the long record of the arrest of Medina Hernández has so far been a crime of violence, theft, theft, theft and possession of methanemine and of arms.

The public hospital, "Rehabilitation Needed" is a five-year-old medical center with the administration of social media news and live.
The public medical department in Zhao was a five-storey in Zhao on 26 days, where hospital names were published on the need for reorganization of the Ministry of Health.
In the study, 38-5 percent of 3 medical facilities are part of a study that has been conducted in the country, and 3 out of every 3 countries have already decided to join and move.
The name of the hospital is published at the National Hospital of East Asian Hospital (Three Civic Towns), the Multi-City Hospital (multi-city), the Small Town Hospital (small city), the Regional Medicines Agency for the Promotion of Ivan Lisunpur Hospital (Ivani City), and the Judiciary Hospital of Judiciary.
The long-term urban and small-town hospitals have been developing plans to build a new hospital in several cities in the east, and thousands of Lisunpur hospitals have decided to move to Long Beach.
The hospital holds the center of the city, including Kea, which has continued to experience the effects of black words these years.
The President of the United Nations emphasized that "the city is still run alone and has an idea of contacting the nearby city's hospital and that the hospital must always remain for its residents," and he expressed negative views about the reorganization and the state.
The head of the East Asian Hospital's office said, "I don't hear anything from the village," and he said, "I'm going to take a good look at the local medical adjustment meeting and respond to the interest of the debate."
In Tokyo, the regional medical facility that runs the Millennium Lisunpur Hospital is "not that the public decides the direction of the public hospital mechanically, but that it is asked to be examined by the local medical councils in the streets."
"I want to hear a little talk about the next hospital run by the party about what the state thinks about various medical facilities.
In the case of medical science, we may ask for a reduction in the number of diseases."

The secret of the Royal Family: the most profitable users of the royal machine have found out.
The Royal Family must travel hundreds of times into the world as a community.
It's usually easy to use your own tools to move kings into the world for important events and events.
Of course, you have your own home equipment.
It's not limited to the long line of entry countries, it's not limited to the number of shipments. It's like Royerfamilies just like it, and sometimes they can invite guests, including random passengers.
According to the recently released channel 5 documentation, only the Queen and Prince Philip seem to be not the best user of the royal machine.
In the Royal Fleet Secrets, the Queen's senior pilots found out that most of the people, including the family, are on a lot of busy trips.
Bob Schills said, "There are times when you're going to ride a very big Royal Dog, just like a very big king's guest."
It's no wonder that the king's dog is famous and wants to take a nice pet with him on a trip.
Queen Elizabeth likes dogs since she was a child and she's been a queen, but she's got more than 30 chickens.
In 2007, Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow and Holly were slaughtered by five dogs.
These five other coccerspaniel's biscuits, Oxo, Flash, Spike, 5 Spanish, and a little bit more Daxfont and a dog's liver, Berlybalcan, and Candy.
The staff that's on the king's machine will be very busy.
Sirs continued to say that the King's staff had left the dog and asked him to stop using it.
Unfortunately, there's never been an accident before.
In the show, the Queen's official travel goods are known to be shocking.
According to the organizer, "The British Federal Museum of 44,000 miles in 1953 had 12 tons of royal cargo."
If you don't want to compare it to two parts of the size of your head, you'll know.

And this is the list band that you're using in the experiment.
"There was a time when the back grew up in the world's era. At the same time, when you put the list band, you felt that your hands were fixed and you were stuck together, so when you tried, you were trying to tap the tape into your hand, and you didn't even sing the list band.
I'm going to have to go back to work. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go.
I'm looking at the explosives on the Trig2nd series.

On the first floor of the party's march in Deepsaus, Jack Edwards, who was elected from the state of Alabama for the period "0, died on the Golden Day.
Mr. Edward died of a mild stroke at the end of the battle, in his own home at Feahop.

The other night before Heli's accident, the Deputy Minister of Defence wrote a report on "Flying Birds" and "Livee."
A petition to Twitter from the Deputy Prime Minister of the Mountain Defence on 26 nights.
It's about half an hour before 27 a.m.
In February last year in the city of Al-Qaeda, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Al-Qaida, who was indicted for the reasons and for the crimes he had committed against his own army war helicopters on the ground, invited him to a "beautiful."
After meeting with the experts on 27 days, he removed his bid.
"It's about half an hour after 26 o'clock in the morning."
I also wrote a picture of the House of Commons and the House of Commons, who took part in the meal, "Beautiful."
And then, Mr. Mount was wrong about the "emergency" thing, and I was satisfied with Twitter.
At a meeting after the 27th meeting, the Ouija board of the Ouija board asked for an opinion on the presentation and said, "We'll see the Twitter."
On the 27th of the day that the report was finalized on three cities, Mr. Albin, who responded to the press release, said about the content of the submission, "If there were someone who felt uncomfortable with my message, it wasn't my intention."
He emphasized that he had deleted it in his own judgment, and he avoided the statement that the tweet was inappropriate.
One of the self-government staff who had been explained to him for 27 days from Mount Ben, said, "What do you think?
The House of Commons has been elected four times since its election in the south-east.
I've been working this month for internal transformation.
In an accident, two members of the group who were with Heli died.
Michel Obama, in his intaggram, called Megan Markel "Inspiration".
Michel Ombama highly appreciated Megan Markel on the day of the tree, a good instaggram, and called her a "sex-assisted, smart leader better than the world."
The Prime Minister and Prince Harry attended the youth's reception this week and met with Ombama's group's staff at the official ten-day visit with Archi Harrison Mount Butten=Winzer.
Mrs. President said, "Thank you very much for breaking the old tradition and for having a smart leader better than the world, my best friend, Prime Minister of Sex @susexroyal. "
Mrs. Obama took a picture of the Meghan Cup, which she shared with the Finance and Poz, and added: "Even though she was talking to the Obama Club, and supported by the girls in the world who were looking for a suitable education, she has encouraged many people."
Megan, a beautiful woman from the former "Sutt" magazine, worked as a guest editor in September of the British Watch magazine and interviewed Mrs. Obama.
In that direct conversation, the President said that she had changed her motherhood and motherhood.
In the interview, Mrs. Obama said, "Being a mother is like giving up the upper class."
My job as a mother has been to find out where I want to be children and give me the right distance to grow up.
It's not the idea of a child being a parent, it's not the age of a child, but it's actually to find out who they are.
In fact, Mrs. Obama, who actually knew the posters in the world, gave some advice to the Prime Minister in his interview with Good Housskoping magazine.
"There are times when people like themselves and their neighbors feel so much better."
So it's my biggest advice.
The first few months in the White House, as they began to work willingly, the girls began to live up to school and became interested in making new friends.
I said it's good, but I think it's good.

The event is the most important event & music event in Japan, which has been launched every year since 2010.
Various models & artists are now taking place in fashionlanwei and live-formans.
There's a red voice in the meeting, when all of us are introduced as a cycrete artist.
So when six of us are down to the stage, we have to go down to the stage, we have to go to the center of the stage, and we've got to go to the station.
Start from "FIRE STORM" if there's no noise.
In the "Jannis Medrey" of the next group, the "Jannis Medrey" group will raise its seat in a popular song such as "A RA SHI" and "one flower in the world".
And finally, it's a beautiful, young original "Cosmic Melody" song, and it's finished with a six-year-old "Aidler" in the Royal Creature.
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do anything about it.
Washington (AP) - The Alcohol Drinking Board of Washington State rejected the complaint that Washington should issue a licence for the sale of alcohol at the local Transient International Hotel.
The Committee failed to qualify on the basis of the complaint that most of the complainants did not have permanent property in Washington, D.C., or in the same state on Sunday, three MPs, two judges and two Jewish leaders.
According to Washington Post, this is the second point of the complaint that it is necessary to obtain a licence for the sale of alcohol, based on the State law that the applicant's "applicability" is required, and that is why it is a second point of ordering the removal of the right to alcohol from the hotel.
The first time that was filed in the summer of last year, President Tramp's violent suspicions and repeated frauds were contrary to state law.
The complaint was rejected because the license has already been approved.
It's like a second complaint that matches the update of the license.
Bentrey's got a first-hand hat collected by "Fling Bees" that he's growing!
It's like the taste of a chicken that comes from the flaminge B.
In May 2019, in the UK Bentrey's club site, food was set up and the harvest was started first in September of the same year.
In addition to the staff working at the club, the workers who worked in the factory gathered more than 100 bottles of rice from the kitchen.
How did Bentrey get to feed?
This is what I want to see!
So this is what Bentrey has to do with this.
Peter Bosch, the department's factory manager, comments on the following.
"In order to contribute to the biodiversity security of the region, I first set up a warehouse in the vast area of the club factory this year.
From the fields planted in the soil and from the mountains around it, the farmers have watched as the farmers have collected various flowers.
It's a great idea that this place is suitable for food and that there's so much harvest for a year.
Bentrey has been promoting a wide range of activities that should be the top of a sustainable high-quality car maker through the club industry and society, and that's also part of its growth.
The staff have been actively helping me.
It's a pleasure to have received the original collection in case it's gone, and next year we set up more warehouses and plans to increase the volume of the pentrery harvest.
It's going to be a small step, but it's going to be a guarantee of the biodiversity of the region.
I'm going to play my part, and I'm going to do a lot of work in the future, and I'm going to start with 120,000 "Fling Bees" eggs in May 2019.
And in the same year over the summer, when the work was done to remove the garbage from the warehouse, it was done on a remote plane, and it was blown away by the debris that fell off the roof.
You can also see the penthouses and packs.
The design of the label was designed by the designer of the pentree, Lees McCrame.
It's not just a piece of paper. It's like it's a gift to the important customers and customers who visit the club.
Britain is a country that values time.
Of course, it's nice to have a nice fannelty with a hat, like a bowling bees, and it's like having lunch.
The next Crebrand police in the state of Nursing is the worst report ever made in England.
The police were under arrest for the worst crime in England.
The Crebrand police have been misreported in all areas.
The Credentials Police are continuing to "serious abuse," says Phil Gomley of the Police Supervisory Board.
For six years, the Chief of Police has transferred five people to this police station and is facing a new call for solutions.
According to the report, he stopped crime, arrested suspects, and tried to protect those who were socially weak.
Phil Gomley from the police station said, "We've been doing a lot of serious damage since we last investigated."
Chief of Police, Mike Will, "The month was not over a year, but he's been given a thorough investigation of his actions," but he's got a number of unpubliced suspects.
Mr. Idrian Roberts, Vice-President, became a part of the state-of-the-art job that was arrested on suspicion of any illegal action.
Simon Howard, the police officer, started the investigation committee because he had been working with his partner for sexual purposes last year.
He fired the police.
Tisbarley, chief of the security party, Huttin, said: "This is because the police have been officially verified.
It's when the Ministry of Internal Affairs comes in."
Richard Lewis, Chief of Police, said, "The improvement has been made, but I have a full responsibility for promoting reform."
And we're going to have to make a decision.
No one knows what's gonna happen.
Now, considering that we are dealing with the fact that we have been hiding in the dark, there is a possibility that there may be time to investigate," Mr. Perosi spoke to CNN's media at the federal parliament.
"I'm going to do the work I've started," said Mr. Perosi.
In the White House record published this week, Tranp found out that he had relied on the president of Walodymil Zelenski, Ukraine, and his son, former Vice President Joe Byden, who was elected president of the United States in 2020.
According to the phone record, Mr. Tramp also found out that he had relied on Zelenski to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal attorney, Suldy Juliani.
Mr. Tramp has denied the wrongs.
CNN reported to the trees that he first found out about the internal charges against the attack on Ukraine that had been filed more than a week earlier than a week earlier in official custody, as a national security lawyer in the province of justice.
The Ministry of Justice, who was accused of having been interviewed by the information agencies, decided that Mr. Tramp's phone calls should be appropriate for the political money dispute investigation.
On the question of whether Mr. Bar should testify, Mr. Perosi said on Friday that he would decide who the Special Committee would ask for witnesses.
But Mr. Parosi added that Mr. Baroness thought he was a criminal.
Of course, that was before the bar.
"Because the name of the final bar was given," said Mr. Perosi, who was touched by Mr. Tramp's name on the phone with President of Ukraine in July.
It's interesting that Mr. Bar will be forced to decide on the beginning of this complaint.
Mr. Perosi said about the internal prosecutor who became an informant, Mr. Tramp attacked the prosecutor on Monday as a spy, and he was surprised to find that the treatment of the spy was different in the past.
I think the president's statement is completely irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Perosi said that internal prosecutors are playing an important role in the U.S. government "and that "the fact that there are people who have been able to provide information to internal prosecutors, even the President's absence of the government, is extremely damaging in the Government."
Mr. Perosi has raised doubts about the pressure on foreign capitals for the sake of fire and political interests, and has declared that he will make a formal defense against Mr. Tramp, and has written a historic step.
The content of the conversation is included in a statement published to the trees, in which the internal prosecutor claims that Mr. Tramp seized power for Ukraine's next presidential election in 2020.
In addition, the internal prosecutors also requested that White House's prosecutors have instructed the relevant parties to remove their phone records from the computer system for use in computer-based use and to transfer them to a special secret information system.
Crystal, Farvard, Christian Bentecke, fast-distance driving bans.
In two months, the Premier's star, Christian Bentecke, who was diagnosed with a second speed difference, will receive a driving ban.
The 28-year-old Foward of Crystal Paris, "On 20 May, he drove his pentree and recognized that he was running at a speed of 50 miles at a speed limit in the south-western Richmond.
After March, this Belgian drew a picture of a speedless reverse camera running at a speed of more than 40 miles at a speed of more than 89 miles per hour in the south-western London Patony.
Bentecke, who lives in Kingston Hill, in the state of Sari, doesn't have to appear in Ravendeer Hill's Security Court this morning.
Even though a judge who was executed in early July and a simple answer to the criminal case continued, Bentek admitted that he was guilty of these two differences.
9.2% of Taiwan's high school students are "experimental" and an increasing number of health authorities (Central Forum) - Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Health (Centralty 27th of Taiwan) joined the World Heritage Day on 26 September and published the results of the survey on the sexual experience of Taiwanese high school students.
So the students who responded that they had experience are 9.2%.
It turned out that about five people didn't get pregnant.
The survey was carried out in 2017 for students enrolled in higher education, higher education and higher education.
Compared with the results of the previous study (15 years), the number of students with sexual experience decreased by a few to 11.1% of the previous time.
On the other hand, 15–17-year-old men and women said that 22.6% did not have abortions in recent sexual acts, and they went up 19.2% last time.
It is found that 28.8% of men (previously 22.6%), 16.2% of women (e.g. 14.5%) are increasingly oriented.
In addition, today's youth has many opportunities to access information on the Internet, and it is easy to get the wrong information and suggest that thinking people prefer.
In order to increase the risk of infection, it is called for accurate knowledge.

Garna: Coffie Maun, a member of the Commission of Investigations.
Coffie Maun, a member of the football manager of Secondi Hasakas, expressed concern about the composition of the next polling committee of the Ghana Sugar Association (GFA).
The question of the inclusion of the President of the Frank Davis Committee showed a lack of satisfaction.
Mr. Maun said that while dealing with GNASports, the committee's findings were of interest and that it was fair and suspicious to include the President.
The Board of Inquiry shall be composed of members of a fair and neutral body from outside of which there is no prior interest.
For example, Mr. Davis made a deal with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Mr. Osei Kwak Parma about compensation.
You're also known as Olympic supporters.
Because of these two reasons, because he's in favour, he doesn't have to be allowed to work on the investigation committee.
Mr. Maun, when Mr. Fred Papoe of the Olympics attended the Committee, said that there would be a conflict of interest on the part of the Committee's relationship with the club and that Mr. Palmer would show that he was prejudiced and unfair towards him.
The members of the Committee decided to start work earlier than yesterday and end up on October 4 after a ceremony held in the GFAA Aclara Office on 19 September.
The Committee is Mr. Frank Davis of the Cooperative Gaubans Consultant, and the Committee is the lawyer's lawyer, Marian Barnoa, and Mr. Emmanuel Darkworth.
The other members have a lawyer, Richard Akpocavy, who is a marketing manager, Reginald Larie, a sports director.
A survey in the Chamber of Commerce found that 54.2% of the small enterprises in the state considered the least-billion-dollars to be the target of "time for thousands" in the country.
20"8 years after the 9th class of companies had been recruited, the number of companies "securely secured" was divided into five new and medium-sized companies, and the number of companies suffering from human security increased to three.
The company that responded to the rise in time to thousands of dollars had more information links ("00%"), construction (70-6%) and sales (6%").
There were more than half of the "opposite" divisions in manufacturing (5-9%) and services including shelters (60-9%).
The owners of the same meeting seem to be "the high tendency to deal with opposition in many forms of parties and time-consuming business, but it's difficult to guarantee human security, and there's a lot of companies that think about it."
When the company replied, "Opposite" was the average value for money when it came up.
"When I heard about the use of the company on 9 March, the new use of the company was 6" 3%, the average use was 54.5%, and the use of the illegal use was "5.4%" by the company.
I didn't pick it up. It was 8-6%.
The number of companies that can't be guaranteed is 44-7% new, 50-3% medium, and the irregularity is 3%.
In particular, transport (new 3%, middle 37.5%) and construction (new 24%, medium 38%).
In most cases, 86-4 per cent of the entire population had problems with the use of " the number of less recruiters " could not provide a favourable condition for " low social knowledge " in cash.
As a response to the administrative demand for employment, there was a large number of voices calling for strengthening and providing information for the 2nd (retirement over 3 years after school) and medium-term use.
There was also an intention to demand that the students have access to the PR opportunities for foreign students and support for various interviews.
With regard to sub-privileged employment, the country's strategy for growth is "5-3% already recognized."
And when I'm going to say, "I'm going to admit it later," I'm going to have to say, "I'm going to do it in three minutes."
The company "not recognized" was 64.4%, construction (82.8%), retail (73%), manufacturing (72-7%).
The investigation took place on 9 July, on 2 August.
298 (29.8%) received an answer.
From the start of the JR's JR on the streets of Taiwan - Yahoo! News
The JR, which led to a traffic accident on the road through the 17th of Taiwan, opened the train from the beginning of the 27th morning.
From the beginning of the 27th morning, JR has returned to normal running.
The JR is located in the middle of the riverbed and the bridge, and the sidelines of the road are affected by the winds, and the roof is flooded.
In addition to trying to drive between the snow and the early rain, the train in the long line of JR has been reduced by actual numbers and the damage of the diamonds has continued.
It's done on 26 days of repair, and it's done on 27 days after driving an unknown test vehicle, and it's started again.
Typrik, before the war and war.
"It's a place to see," said Justin Tiprick, when World Cup, who decided to take the course of the next tournament, welcomed the Australian war.
If Wears wins the Warabys, it will be the hottest win in the Polish D, and it will be sure that they're ready to win the French or Algentin.
On the other hand, if Australia, which has fought 15 so far, has won a victory in the 14th War against Wales, the Tiprik and the team will be a constant line between the best 8 battles in England and England.
"Of course it is. I want to challenge the two teams and finish up on the group top."
The war against (Australia) has had serious consequences, but it's been a good victory over the last few years.
I think Australia's going to be guilty of returning the debt, but it's going to be forced to win again.
I knew this was a mountain before I came here.
And I'm here. It's a real sight here.
Wells has so far won the three-year war against Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, but the victory to Warabies has been the third of the previous 32 years.
And under Wallen Gatland's supervision, the total score for the three teams in the South was only seven in the 41st battle.
Wells stopped the battle on November 13, last November, but typlic was one of the voters who played in the Tokyo Stadium.
He asked if he didn't want to win any more before he won, and Tiprick said, "It's hard to answer.
I'm sure I've tried, too many, but I don't know.
As a result, I gave about 15 points at the end of the test, and it seemed that it was more scoopy than it was.
In order to win Whales, Australia's Conbies, known as the Back Lore, will catch up with Michael Fever and David Pock and the Black Down Batteries of Tiprik.
Typlic, who has been tested by the 67th International Assembly so far, has been aware of what has been done with the past and what is expected of the two voters.
He says, "They're not wrong about the world level's backers."
When we fight the Worldgrass Bacroo, we always know that we're going to have a hard time.
They're always the world's top level.
So I know exactly how it's going to work.
In a safe battle, Pokock is one of the world's backers, and Michael's only attackable bags are there, but he may say that he's just walking around where he wants to go when he needs it.
I'd rather fight with such a weak and weak background than fight with the world's greatest player and I'd like to raise myself up.
I'm going to fight the best partner, and if I'm going to fight those two guys, I'm going to have to make a deal myself.
It's not about winning this Sunday, but for us, it's a big test in the World Cup.
It's a big deal.
If you keep up your good papermanship, you'll be able to try hard.

Eastenders, nettabare: Ben's kisses in the column after Whiteney's bomb.
In East Enders, Kalam Hyeway (Tone Cray) was shocked by the sudden explosion of the Whiteney Dean (Shorna Macgarty), which led to the return of the loved ones, and before the heat of Kalam and Ben Mitchell (Max Bowen).
But do you start a romantic relationship with two people or do you want to regret this hot moment?
Since the column has helped Ben, and the poor Bobby Bill (Cray Miller Russell) has been able to help him, two people have been able to progress slowly, and he has recently become weak and looked forward to seeing Ben.
Tonight, Whitney's going to be feeling better than we're going to go back to the rest.
It is clear that she was very affected by leaving Walford soon after it became apparent that she had to be a sad wedding and a flower.
When Whitney came home, she had to talk to her boyfriend about it.
But not yet, Whitney knew the facts and added his hand to the column, and it's good for him.
The column is moving, and Jay Mitchell (Jaymy Boswick) is worried about the column on Queen Vic.
The column that became sensitive goes into Ben's side, and it's all about what happened and blames Ben.
Ben says to calm down his anger and calm down his anger, and if two of them just kiss the kiss, the blast of the column turns into a rage.
But how do you two get out of here?
Two people tried to date the next week, but Ben was given the material that he thought about being together so far, and everything that he was doing was going to be gone.
But when we stand up for Gay's father, we're determined to fight for what we want and what we need to do.

If Jibbin's business has a "9th class of Gala", how about it be a gift from the poet?
One of the problems with anti-social violence is the cross-cutting problem.
At a meeting on 22 July, the president of the Coalition Board said, "The company's either one talent in 9 or not," and he says, "5 to 6 to 4" on average, but this is what people are resisting.
With regard to the ratio of "9:1", if there are 9 sections of Jibbin, it is thought that there have been a gift from the miner to Gibbin, and the investor's view that the tax will be paid is spread on Twitter and more than 30,000 times retweeted.
If there's a "9:1" in the gallery, there's gonna be a fee and tax.
Anju was asked by the tax authorities.
● Not even a legal person.
And I'm going to say that we're going to have a lot of money.
It's not a private business, it's not a legal person, it's not a tax.
If there's a share of $9.1 million in the company, it's going to cost 1 million dollars and it's going to cost 9 million dollars.
This is a legal tax.
Of course, this should be a tax declaration, which is already taxed by the law.
And even if you were wondering if you'd have a question about sharing, you're not saying that the money you actually got is not different than the money you should have given.
And I think he's claiming to sell the money he's given.
If you're not aware of it, you're not going to give it to each other if you're not aware of it.
It is a matter of calculating tax rates if you have negotiated prices that are clearly priced (e.g. non-inflicted sales) in order to avoid tax evasion.
However, as this time, the third party will not be able to decide how much taxable prices are due to what both parties have negotiated without dispute.
I think it's a personal offense to have a paycheck.
In 2008, after the university of the tax authorities, Anhu was registered as a tax agent after the university of the tax authorities.

White House, a big panic attack.
The White House's associate has been up against the pressure of the new Democrats on the tree and explained that this week there is a "great panic" about the lack of plans to deal with the new reality.
People near the White House said that there seems to be a high level of concern, anxiety, anxiety, anxiety, concern about the possibility that internal prosecutors may give the president and some of the neighbors a lot of damage.
They said, "It doesn't matter if there's no reality."
The White House's associate had no clear plan for this situation, nor was it possible for the President to apply the usual approach that has so far been so well-known, since this claim was very serious, and it was still not certain how it has progressed, "it does not seem like the next news is going to be destroyed."
Another person who was aware of this debate expressed the alarming attitude in the White House, which raised awareness of the state of shock, in order to raise the hope that the President would respond to the constant shock.
Other information says that the president's president's president's president is getting married every day, and that he's also near the president's side, which he's looking forward to doing more "active" behavior.
Now, there's an unforeseeable move, and there's a car that's going to be taken with a sense of urgency about the possibility of an unexpected attack, and there's a lot of attention to the presidential and political environment in the electoral year.
Tramp faced the greatest threat that he had ever faced during his presidential term, and he turned his hands into an attack and a defence party to restore the strategy he had effectively decided in Russia's investigation into Robert More.
In order to look at the dependability of the President of Ukraine who wants to cooperate in the investigation of the political enemies, Tramp has been interested in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Jo Byden and has tried to undermine the trust of the internal prosecutors as a motivation for party opposition.
But many of the White House people are enduring the test of Detective Moore, and this time they're starting to feel different.
He was the president of the state of Brand, but he seemed to be referring to this situation at a meeting of water reporters.
The tramp's been asking questions about Russian suspects, and it doesn't seem like it was in the heart of the Ukrainian question.
The internal prosecutor claims that there are people who have not had direct information about the fact that the controversial President of Tranmp and Vorojimil Zelenski and the President of Ukraine have not had direct contact with the President of Ukraine, and that it is the fact that the internal prosecutor's credibility is undermined, and that Damezy is near the President who is convinced that it can be reduced.
Moreover, the fact that the president is being attacked well increases his support for the fact that he did so.
However, the joint party's strategy near the White House indicates that the basic support rate of the President is already very high and that the new supporters will not have any effect.
In particular, if it is a matter of four-six hours' isolation from the bill, "there's no advantage in focusing on the presidential election in the last four months".
Other information says that those who claim to be the help of the President are not fully aware of how uncertain the President's response will be.
A thoughtful White House member is asking for advice on how to make a team of defenses.
According to the associate who explained the structure of this project, this arrangement is still an initial step, but it is still not clear how such a strategy will be implemented or how it will be implemented.
However, it is recognized that there is a need for a clear leader who can organise broadcasting activities in an aggressive manner to resist the presence of a critical internal communication document and its propaganda publications and its propaganda against the democracies.
According to the information available in this situation, the long-term strategic view of the long-term view of the long-term view is clearly seen in the absence of a statement that the President of the Tranquil Ukraine does not have to publish a memorandum of communication within 48 hours.
According to the people involved in this case, people who are likely to respond to the attack are called the outside pittbull of the tramp, who serve as Prime Minister of the Electoral Action, Corrie Rwandaski.
But it's not right for Rwandaski to show himself to be the leader of such an organization.
"For the past five years, we have done everything we can to support the president and the policy, but we have not talked to the president or the neighbor about participating in this false talk team."
And Jay Secrow, an external defense lawyer at the Molar investigation, is also involved in the planning of the bombing.
And to get the NBC news, Secrow answered, "The problem will be handled properly."
The Emmet Flade, who led the White House until the end of his investigation, followed the Clinton Arrow, went away, and Pat Siproon, who is now in charge of the White House law, lacks this experience, and White House has now had no medical experience with the problem of radiation.
The information known to the White House strategy suggests that the people involved recognize that it is far from the structure of the humane recruitment and strategy team, but that they are organized and all can lead to a strong response and political struggle.

Devin Nenes, accused the Democratic Party of the "Node Photo of the Tramp."
Mr. Devin Neess (California Joint Party) seems unable to bear the idea that President Donald Tramp will be investigated.

Origami Wallet adds to the payment by Origami Pay, and the possible application of income (moving) through connection to financial and financial institutions.
I'll add the charge function.
With partner companies, they start financial services such as finance, investment, and insurance.
I mean, we can use the financial functions that are paid, moved, charged, borrowed, and prepared, origami Wallet.
Origami Financial Services, the director of the mining company, said: "We have to live with a variety of issues of money, such as years of money and low money, and create a new financial service for young people."
Origami Wallet's advantage is that if you have Origami ID, you're going to end up in a trade with Simres and you're going to get information on time.
In addition to Origami's application, he explained that it would be a service that could be used without Origami's application.
In terms of finance, we're going to introduce the functions that can be combined and paid when making decisions.
And when the money was needed, it would end up in Origami's application from the request until the return.
In terms of insurance, Nisei is a partner company and a first-life insurance company.

The provision of financial services is in order to increase and increase the number of necessary administrative services.
"Origami Technologies" for the effective use of data.
Origami announced on the same day that the company has digitised customer points through Origami's decision-making functions, and that the company will set up a new regular "Origami Technologies" to support the efficient use of data, including the company's data.
Origami is aware that the efficient use of data, such as the collection, management and analysis of the data, is a problem for the company's partners, such as Origami Network, and that data is not created for sale and that it is not created by real society.
In it, along with Origami Technologies, they support access to data from their company's Pay, as well as data created by companies that keep them up to date, and support access to data from non-structured.
With the effective use of data, they are contributing to the development and transformation of new business models that use digital technology and data.
Origami, the director of the acquisition company, said, "There are now many companies collecting data and making customer contacts," and "In the next phase, the key is how you're using the data to develop business models."

The possibility of emission reduction in biofuel research again.
In recent years, electric cars and tesla trucks are not the only ones that can be reached by air.
But Professor Alberta of the University of Alberta has developed a technique that can be used as jet fuel again.
Dr. David Brassler, Professor of Environmental Sciences at the Department of Agricultural Sciences, started this project in 2003.
The professor's study room develops fossil fuels from fossil fuels such as oil from the restaurant, livestock production and canola oil.
This technology is different from ethanol and its other biofuels and can use low-quality petroleum fuels for production, and carbon emissions are less than 85 per cent of the original fuel, and other industrial wastes can be used in production processes.
This technology will also contribute to the renewal of carbon monoxide existing in the fuel of the oil base.
Dr. Brassler said, "The success of this technology in the first century (in fact, it was born) is a process of freezing the elements in diesel gas line."
The following biofuels technology tends to be unstable and unstable and causes serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The problem of jet fuel is like no more german," said Dr. Brassler.
There's no value as much as diesel, but there's a much higher requirement.
In Dr. Brassler's research room, Jet is currently looking at two choices as a bio fuel.
One of the low-risk applications requires another treatment of hydrocarbon fuels and addition of water.
The second option is to continue to study chemical reactions in both low and low temperatures.
Dr. Brassler said about the second option: "The chemical reaction can also be tested in the atoms to make little changes."
This option is high risk.
In addition to increasing investment in possible options by airlines, Canadians and U.S. Army forces, Alberta University's Children's Association Forige Hidrocarbons is engaged in production.
"They're predicting that someone's going to pay a lot of carbon taxes in the future," said the doctor.
I want you to prepare a case for the worst.
At present, Foreji has worked near Edmonton's waste management center and recently invested 4 million dollars from Rocky Martin in support of the construction of a 25 million-m2 production facility in Sonbra, Ontario.
The factory is planning to produce about 1 million litres of biofuels per year.
Dr. Brassler says that the amount of carbon remains 85 per cent but that there is no reason for a reduction in the share of fuel transport and production.
Mr. Brassler says, "As a shop of technology."
My job is to get an option so that I can make a number of choices when I'm given an explanation.

Boris Johnson's warning is that if the brigget is covered up, the British will face an attack like Rosansells, and the Prime Minister will call for silence.
If the second national vote covered the outcome of the second round, there is a risk of "violent violence by the people" in this country, said the Prime Minister last night.
The prime minister's senior officials warned that Britain would face the violence of the French blue-beest movement and the “Rousanzels’ violence in 992.
Mr. Johnson said that "we need to slow down our anger" about the political words that were associated with a heated argument, but he said that we should stop using the word "the North."
No matter what the Prime Minister has accused of taking the rest back, one of them said to the Times: "In this country, there is no such thing as Jerry Joon (Golden Best Movement) or "Rousanzels Act of 992."
The only reason why there has not yet been a national is that there is no violence in this country.
There are already examples of the redest movement that they've been hiding their cell phone and putting on a demo, and there's a number of populist leaders who are using their dirty hands.
In Los Angeles, "992 years ago, a black taxi driver, Rodney, was attacked by four white police officers who shot King, who were convicted of committing crimes.
In this year, a French anti-government demo participant, Jille, who is wearing a red dress that attracts people, has been causing confusion and destruction in the city of Paris for more than six weeks.
It pointed out that if Britain failed to remove the EU, "our country's political system's confidence would be devastating."
"When 3 million nationals vote in national votes and 66% vote for those remaining in the EU, "Millions are disappointed."
Even though 99 percent of the authorities objected to leaving, they were very angry, "How can there be no way that 100,000 people could write letters to the House of Commons?"
There's not enough time for thousands of people to get out.
One high-level minister added that if two national votes were to cover the outcome of the second round, there would be a risk of "violent violence by the peoples" in this country.
Mr. Johnson is calling for a vote to be handed over to the president of the budget.
It is reported that Mr. Johnson is faced with a rebellion in the basement where he has been asked to leave the EU.

The potential to increase the risk of heart disease and heart failure in large numbers of agricultural drugs.
A recent study shows that there is an increased risk of heart disease when working around high levels of pesticides.
This has been the result of a survey of a group of Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
In comparison with the group of men who did not work around agriculture, a large number of drug users found that the risk of heart disease and heart failure was 45 percent higher.
"What is emphasized in this study is the importance of using personal protective equipment when exposed to agromedicine at work, recording that there is agricultural exposure at work, and preventing standard risk factors of heart disease," said Dr. Beatrice Rodríguez, associate researcher.
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor of advanced medical science at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This was the result of a study of data collected from more than 6,000 men living on the island of Oaf, who participated in the Koakkini Honolulu heart program.
Since this study is only for men on the day, researchers say that it may not be possible to apply to women and other kinds of people.
Agricultural drugs are likely to have a long half-life, and health effects are likely to occur after years of exposure.
In this study, there was the biggest impact on the "0 year after it was revealed.
"As a result of a 34-year follow-up study, it is no longer important for the detection of agricultural drugs at work and the relationship between heart disease and heart failure," said Dr. Rodriguez in a press release.
This is probably because there are other factors that are more important in terms of hypertension than they are because they hide possible relationships between pesticides and heart disease in the evening.
Researchers have found that there is no significant link between exposure to low-medium pesticides and cardiovascular disease.
I'm going to talk to Zerenskitramp on the phone.
It was a very exciting week on Washington's political issue.
For the first-time politician Vorojimil Zelenskie, he wanted to avoid getting into a political scandal.
But what's going on on about Zelenskitramp's phone problem so far, and would Zelenski be affected by the wide range?
For the first time in a telephone call, the United States has spoken to Zelenski that it is more vulnerable to Ukraine than other European countries.
The phone records published from the White House are not in the language, and it is described in detail that the tramp accused the Prime Minister of England and other European heads of State of a more specific proposal.
The response of Zelenski, who wants to oppose the tramp by 100 percent, is controversial.
Zelensky added that President McCron and Michael are not fully supportive of Ukraine.
This conversation was interrupted, and politicians, especially Ukrainians, argued on social media.
President Pedro Poroshenko wrote to Twitter, "There is no previous example of EU support."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he is grateful for the support of EU Russia's sanctions and economic assistance in Russia's aggression.
Ukraine's politicians, Victoria Waitiskika, say, "Can you communicate with Germany and France once more," and there are other politicians who show concern.
The trumpet continued to be a little bit of a military aid, and not a case of Zelensky, "not a case of two investigations, one of which is about the son of Jobyden, and one of which shows that Ukraine was involved in misinformal entry into the E-mail of the Democratic Party in 2016 and one of the services of the National Committee of the Democratic Party hacked.
It's not clear whether this is a barrier to Europe's relationship or whether it's going to put back water on France and Germany's brains.
I don't want to tell anyone about it.
Thanks to those who support us, the phone records were published and," Zelensky said at the United States Congress in New York.
Zelenskie is planning to meet with the head of the Russian, German and French brains at Normandy 4th in October.

Mr. Tramp, Mr. Peter Gino is appointed to the FEMA's top officer: White House.
The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Board (FEMA) represented Peter Ginono on 3 April 2019 at the U.S. National Security Council Committee in Capiter Hill, Washington, U.S.A., in 2020, at the 2020 FEMA Court of State Security.

FEMA Vice-President Gino was in the position of Chief Agents to monitor the damages of the Hariken and the Government, such as the volcano.
Since the resignation of the former President's President, Mr. Block Long, the officer who was admitted to the Supreme Court has been in a state of non-state.

Another suggested Mr. Jeffrey Byard was suspicious of alcohol and alcohol abuse as a result of the investigation, and was excluded from the selection earlier this month of the investigation.
Mr. Gino's appointment was expected.

Prior to his appointment as Vice-President of FEMA in 2018, Gino was appointed by the Emergency Authority in Loddeland and was a Marine soldier, says Whitehouse.
CBSROSANZELS - The police have closed the illegal Malifana Biping industry of San Gabriel Barley.
Elmonte (CBSLA) - The police closed the illegal Malifana Bayping operation of San Gabriel Barley.
The police started operating at 4:37 p.m. after suspected of illegal marijuana-type sale, and a large container of bottle oil was discovered at the Telster's 9600-block office.
The Elmonte Police Department, Christopher Cano, said that the agent also found equipment that would disrupt the biocardry.
"This project is very dangerous," said the Cano Police Department.
The Cano Police Department has been following a drug investigation in the past and says there is a potential for fire in the process of extracting oil used for pipe products.
"There is a possibility that only the light from the clothes can be extinguished, and it can cause explosions, not just fires, but fires."
And if there were such a number of such devices, then not only were there fires and explosions, but all of Bills could be blown away.
The risk management team was gathered to an empty office and seized dangerous substances illegally.
The prices of the items and equipment held were not immediately published.
The investigator said that he had received a reputation for finding illegal activities.
Detectives are looking for who the black screen of illegal cybersex is.
The police said that since the office was empty, it thought the owner had built a store in the office.
In the course of the investigation, the police said they wanted the latest news about the dangers of beiping, especially, and wanted that illegal beiping products should not be released again.
The cannon police said, "It's a real thing or something that people don't even know."
The product may also be mixed with its other harmful substances.
This may have caused much damage to our communities and children, so the police are always warning people not to get close to this activity.
There's six major earthquakes in the middle of the concert!
A runaway training at the Hole City Hall (NewsUMK) - Yahoo! News
And I was thinking about what happened in the middle of the concert, and there was a practice of escape training in the city hall.
This training is being started every year.
In the stage, there's actually a demonstration by the fire department in the city of Khartoum, and it's supposed to be that there will be a earthquake of 6 magnitude in the way of the song.
On the 27th day of training, about 300 people, such as young villagers, local residents, were present.
“ The garden children are having fun, ” says the book The Bible.
(Applause)
"It's an earthquake, it's an earthquake, it's going to happen.
This time, I thought there was a fire, and the participants ran away from the Interlans.
I don't know where it's going to happen.
The participants changed their training and raised their sense of security.
Elizabeth's missing clothes show up at the Hampton Cott Hall.
It was built by the highest-class comerlets of comerlets, and it was made up of a lot of beautiful plants, flowers, and flowers.
Historic Royal Palace's clothing collection author, Mr. Ellery Lin, decided it was something.
Mr. Lin has seen one of the clothes he lost from the world's ancient art dances, which was put on the wall of a small church in the countryside.
Mr. Lin, having found this glorious box used as an altar of the church in Bacton of Helfordshire, is planning to be shown at the House of Hampton Cotton next month, just as the queen of Chad has been using it for more than 450 years.
"There's only one other thing that remains in the 6th century, and we know that there was an important discovery in all the Royal Dress Collections.
There is no complete evidence that Elizabeth had put her clothes on, and through a three-year study, she was convinced that she had nothing to do with the royal property.
The fact that Bub used a very high-valued object "bank" in the royal court was prepared only by senior members, but it shows that the former owner was a great person with the qualities of "name" and flowers, which were later added to the bees, dogs, bees, bees, and bees.
When it was made, it seemed that it was worth half the price.
Moreover, in the late 1590s of Elizabeth, the queen was among the other women in the temple, and it was suggested that I should not be ashamed of the libel who wore such beautiful clothes.
Mr. Lin, it's important to publish, and I've come to see some of your fellow experts.
It's always very nice to see everyone looking at that bubble, but it's always very nice to say, "That's great," and I'm sure you're looking at one of the Royal clothes."
One of the long seconds of a dress used as an altar of the Church of St. Francis of Bacton, which was cut off and invisible to human eyes, doesn't seem so unexpected.
Bacton is reported to have been involved in the long life of the Queen of Elizabeth in the city of Blanche Paris, where he served as a female.
Dresus has been dead since Paris since 1590, but experts believe that before Elizabeth died in 1603, she must have progressed to her family or church as a follow-up to Paris.
More than 1,000 hours of repair, including a very detailed handbag with a specially infected silicon and a special operating device for 400 hours, is expected to be shown on the site of Elizabeth, one of the most popular modern paintings that was taken from the Hatfield House during the show.
The vast space that only one of the most valuable topestries can capture is that of the newly modified heat room in the Hamptoncott, where the storage works are done almost everywhere, and the Libby Thompson, who is leading the work, says, "If you are dealing with a historical hole, you really feel the respect for the professional technique of the person who created it."
It's a very great respect for the person who made it.
I've never seen any of this work done before.
Elizabeth's missing dress will be held at the Hamptoncott Hall from October 12.
"I've been looking for a range of trusts," said the woman's cousin, "I don't know."

In the week of the 28th, the search began with about 240 police and self-defense officers.
But the village, "Looked for an independent area," asked the army to withdraw, and it ended in the morning.
The self-sustainment team has placed 650 people at the centre of the mountain's edge and the high-risk area for 25 to 4 days, but it can't be taken.
And on the 27th day, 20th-century men who participated in the search in the adventure were unaware of the path they were looking for, so we didn't find them.
The police and fires continue to search from 29 days to 6 a.m. in the morning.

I'm in charge of three thirds of the drug in the United States.
After the day of Chicago Westside, CBSNews captured the laser for drug trafficking.
Brian McNight, DEA, revealed what he's doing with white courts.
In Chicago last year, about 800 people died of drug abuse.
McNite said that the "probably 9th" of the drugs brought in in Chicago was imported from Mexico.
DEA notes that the name El Mencho is commonly known as the Mexican drug king Nemesio Selvantes.
"Mencho is, in fact, the most important person in the U.S. federal law enforcement system."
The loan paid to El Mencho is worth $10,000.
With Donahu's help, several decades of El Mencho's drug production in millinium have been destroyed.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harlisko Neva Tenerasion (CJNG) is involved in at least three minutes of drugs introduced into the United States by road and sea.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the same cartel has sold "a large amount of cocaine, methane and fentanyl mixed heroin."
El Mencho's head is paid $1 million.
In fact, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but he was arrested on suspicion of drugs and sent back to Mexico.
That's where he started a violent drug cult.
There's a lot of weapons, a traditional rocket gun, 50 guns.
Donahu said he owns his own special team.
El Mencho is killing his kingdom without being punished.
In recent years there have been thousands of deaths caused by the fight against drug cartels.
According to statistics from the Government of Mexico, one day about 94 homicides are taking place.
In Chicago, for drug-induced Mexican drugs to strengthen their drug habit, it is necessary to use protective clothing when treated.
The production point is that the cocaine bag has the fingerprints of the seller.
More than three minutes, it's called El Mencho's drug cartel.
Donahu said, "Mencho is involved in the flow of harmful substances that actually capture the lives of innocent women and children."
So when someone died, Donahu said that it was "high chance" that the drug from El Mencho's organization had died.
More than 67,000 Americans died last year from rape.

"By February, by the time we tried, the Wagon car, which consisted of food supplies and food, had been traveling between the city and the city council on the first day.
There are also fast-paced goods that sell more than expected, and there's a voice from the residents that it's "good to choose goods."
The Wagon car has "0" points, such as food, city-specific food and washing.
Just as one person can eat at the age of five, the small pot salad that is distributed to the pack is a "00" price.
We're going to have to get a list of people in the city, and we're going to sell them.
The House of Lords showed a strange face, "I didn't think I'd be able to sell it like this."
The usual thing that he bought in his husband's drive, Mr. Denis, was that he hoped that "it would be easier for him to keep going.
The user was also quoted as saying, "Not a cup of coffee, but a cup of coffee."
The Council will examine all the items it wants.
Now, on the island of Dedan, the only place to buy daily supplies is the Convini store, and the council tried to sell the "purchased" goods.
"To February, we'll go back to the 20th meeting on the island on a monthly basis and see if we can continue in business since next year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison indicated that he decided to provide $10,000 additional support to the affected population.
The cash support policy for farmers, even for victims, has been extended and has been largely addressed for the simplification of existing farmers.
In addition, some $34 million is planned for a multi-skilled housing support facility, and farmers are expected to receive more than $3 billion in emergency assistance.
As a programme of regional assistance, the largest 13 self-governing bodies will be helped to limit $1 billion for infra-compensation and victimization to each.
In addition to this time's additional support, the government has already estimated over $70 billion in cash and support.
Ronald Lee Haskell: My wife's family is suspected of killing her in Texas.
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas, 2014, by Mr. Stephen and Katie Stey and four of his children.
The authorities said that on 9 July 2014, Haskell entered Mr. Stey's home and questioned Mr. Melanie Haskell's residence in the area.
Mr. Melanie wasn't there, but her sister Katie Stee had a family.
Haskell was released and Mr. Steven Stee (39), Katie Stey (33), 13 and 4 years old, and his 9 and 7-year-old daughter died.
In the family, only one person, Cassidy Stee, who was then 15 years old, saved his life.
At the time, the authorities reported that Mr. Cassidy was seriously injured, but then he completely recovered.
Mr. Woodman, the attorneys, all agreed to reject the claim of innocence for the loss of Lord Lee Haskell's heart.
The attorneys were dismissed until Monday's time.
"If you choose to disappoint us, you'll never forgive."
Is the girl's complaint that upsets her anger has affected the leaders of the countries in which she lives?
Earth's temperature increases significantly.
In the U.S. Climate Action Summit in New York, six-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Tumberi spoke for increased response.
It's been a fire-fighting tool in the world that's going to blow up the school and sit in front of the parliament.
Young people who have been robbed of their security have taken up a protest campaign around the world, including Japan.
"More than four million people in over 50 countries appear to have participated.
I walked through the message board in the spring.
The threat of climate change is approaching.
The international "Paris Agreement" which began in Bingre in 2020 is aimed at reducing the global greenhouse gas emissions to a substantial zero in the last half of the century and reducing the temperature twice as high as before the industrial revolution.
In the case of the developing countries, all the participating countries are not different from those of the other countries.
However, there is a difference between the unusual features of the relationship between heat and rain.
We're going to need a combination of factors for the heat up in the fast phase.
The summit, which took place in the wake of the call of the Head of State Gutres of the United Nations for a crisis, showed the long-term objective of the 77Ccan countries to be in actual zero for up to 50 years.
The other 70 countries wanted to raise their own targets.
On the other hand, China and India have not revealed their new goals except those of the United States that have emerged from the Paris Agreement and have become a sign of the drive of large countries.
It's also a strong criticism of Japan, which keeps its firepower.
The government's long-term strategy allows only half of this century to produce early emission zeros, but it's a big difference between countries that target 50-year zeros.
I didn't even have a chance to speak to Japan at the summit.
In the context of the environmental union, Japan's small step-by-step environmental environment has said, "It's fun, it's cool, it's sexy."
The appellant doesn't deny it, but he's too weak than girls' complaints.
There's no way we're going to react to Greta, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
And if you don't have to argue about it, you're gonna have to change your mind.
There is no room for warming, and the international community has to deal with the global crisis.
I don't want to have a way of bringing together countries.
There's a lot of kids behind Mr. Greta.
To prevent that future from happening, we need to act as adults.
I mean, I'm going to have a little bit more of an internet than I've ever done.
As a result of the U.S. Army's research, there was an approach to the reality of the mass internet.
On this Internet, it may be possible to provide time-consuming military security in order to connect to the next network.
The U.S. Army Institute is providing funding and the U.S. Military Institute for the Development of Military Capacity Development has reported that researchers from Insbruck University have reached a 50-kilometre distance using lightbulb.
It's related to the enzymes that are produced in a quantity of particles such as quantify bits.
If two dimensional bits are in the entangling state, and if a quantification is made on the video, even if the quantified bits are in a far-off space, they will still affect the results of quantification on the spectral.
"This distance [50km] is much bigger than it was in the past, and it's actually far from starting the construction of a city-wide network," says Dr. Ben Ranion, a project's leading researcher at Insbruck University of Insbruck, who published the results in the Neichar magazine.
Although there is a great distance between the city's metro network, it can be made up of a network of physical quantities in the Entangling state.
The distribution of this element is absolutely essential for the creation of a mass internet.
"This evidence is a major step in the implementation of a wide range of entries," said Dr. Sara Gamble, assistant to the military programme that supports the study.
Also, the entonglingment that went through the fibers also holds sufficient quality to meet the number of conditions required for the use of some of the most difficult networks.
The research team started experimenting with the calcium atom that was captured in the intrap.
The researchers used laser light lines to record the amount of data on Ion and encouraged it to release the data stored by the amount of data.
As a result, the atom's mass and light bulbs became an entangling state.
The problem is to send that light to the lightbulb.
"The fluorescent light released from the Calcium moon is 854 nanometers, and the light fiber cable is absorbed immediately."
So in the doctor's team, he first sent the light bulbs through the non-linear cables that fired the powerful laser.
The beam of light is the most suitable value for long-range transmission -- the standard wave of current distance communication, which is 1550 nanometers.
And then I sent this light through a 50-kilometre lightbulb.
As a result of the calculations, the atoms and the light bulbs were kept in a state of english.
"The use of calcium atoms" is the reality of an interconnected network in the distance between the atoms, so that they can capture them at the same time as the number of bits of carbon atoms.
A large amount of Entangling Time Network is a very important field for military personnel from the right location, traffic law and timing. "And Dr. Frederic Fatemi, another military researcher who is co-run this program, said.
