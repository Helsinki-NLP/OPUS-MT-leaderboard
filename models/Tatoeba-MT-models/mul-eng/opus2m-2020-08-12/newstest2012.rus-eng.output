Parliament does not support the amendment granting freedom to Timoschenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament, in its amendment to the Criminal and Procedural Code, has rejected the attempt to abolish the article by which the opposition leader, Julia Timoschenko, was convicted.
The amendment, which would have led to the release of the former Prime Minister in prison, was rejected during the second reading of the Bill on the Reduction of Economic Offences.
In October, Timoschenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was considered ineffective.
The sentence is not final; the court will consider the appeal of Timoschenko in December.
Timoschenko claims that the sentence is a political place in the regime; the process in the West has also been challenged.
The proposal to repeal article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which the former Prime Minister had been convicted, was supported by 147 Members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes in favour.
Leviathan Victory
In the history of liberation, or resurrection, Libya has already been lost.
Maammar Kaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert, without it the war is over.
It's time to determine the winners.
Islamists are usually defeated in the country; the question of whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the customary law of Sharia which we have already heard of.
Libya will become a country without crime, as punishment for murder is cut off.
Women may forget about emancipation; potential rebels will be punished; etc.
Instead of the dictator of society, which consists of opposing clans, it will be united by the Qur'an.
In Libya there will be an order that we can't imagine and which we'd rather want.
In any case, our way of life is not the only form of life, nor would it be the best and most likely for the people of Libya, for example.
In fact, it's amazing that the Islamic fighters have received help from unbelievers.
The only reason for them is that they believe that NATO has not guided the people of the United States.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West isn't part of them.
We participated in the bombings, served Islam, and our policies were saved from the dictator, their political allies, without any guarantees of benefits.
In view of recent economic experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we decided to withdraw from the military occupation of Libya.
The local population should therefore not be concerned about the expulsion of "Christmas".
Even without employment, will oil companies get the black gold of Libya practically worthless?
Sooner or later, they won't get it, and then the West will finally be able to step up with an unnecessary protection of civil rights.
If only Shariat followers don't end this.
A new wave of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe are now at the centre of the attention of investors.
The statistical storm hit Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries published GDP data in 3 quarters.
Compared with the previous quarter of the Czech economy, Germany and France have shown growth.
And today, the long market will be recorded.
Investors are not only looking at Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The Statistical Offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have published their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries also adjusted data on the second quarter in which Germany was better off than expected (a rise of 0.3 per cent instead of a significant 0.1 per cent). France reported a small decrease of 0.1 per cent (a significant increase was proposed).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy has shown a preliminary increase of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared with the previous quarter, GDP was stable, according to the Czech Statistical Office, this confirmed the trend towards gradual slowing economic growth.
The results were worse than predicted by analysts.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy has shown a preliminary increase of 1.5 per cent; however, it has remained stable compared with the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter of its economy.
From July to September, the economy, both the Eurozone and the European Union, has demonstrated growth compared to the previous quarter of 0.2 per cent, which is consistent with the analytical projections.
Greece's economy has shown a preliminary decrease of 5.2 per cent.
The availability of its 10-year-old bonds is 28.45 per cent.
The availability of both Italian and Spanish bonds is closely related to the critical note.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, and so forth, are experiencing difficulties.
Despite the deterioration in the situation in the region, the income of Czech 1-year-old bonds remains about 4 per cent.
In Germany, the ECB is the last creditor to save the situation.
The Czech Republic has passed a team in the euro area.
In Montenegro, they won 1:0 and celebrated an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team has successfully met the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the great Czecho and the beautiful cave Peter Iraƒçek they won with account 1:0.
In the second team, the Czech team managed to maintain a significant advantage after the domestic response match, and it would participate again in the European campaign.
IHNED.cz watched the match and made a detailed report.
Almost nothing significant in the first team and much success in the second.
The Czech National Assembly, partly because of the defeat of the team at the end; the Great Czech; and the Heroic Iraqi; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated the European Championship.
The superior defence of the Czech team allowed the Montenegrin team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianovic and the students became the most unsuccessful couple of fighters after two great opportunities were left.
The great Peter Chech is one of the reasons that the Czech National Assembly will not miss the European Championship next year, and the Czech football will earn about 200 million Czech dollars.
The first minute of the game was very stressful.
Both teams were experiencing difficulties with combinations; most of the time went to the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure by the first team of buyers, and further attacks on the defence line were taken by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country ' s nuclear programme.
They've created a living protection.
Several hundred university students have established a living protection around the nuclear power station in Iran.
However, they would like to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible attack by Israel.
On Tuesday morning after students' prayers before entering the building, a petition for the death of both the United States and Israel followed.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have established a live protection around the Isfahan Urinary Institute.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country ' s nuclear programme at their own cost.
In its latest report, the International Nuclear Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that it was all evidence that Iran had not given up its efforts to obtain nuclear weapons.
The possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday morning after the students' prayers before entering the Isfahan Urana Rehabilitation Institute, the petition for both U.S. and Israel was followed by a petition for death.
In the event of an attack aimed at the maximum parallelization of the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets, according to the Israeli press, will be established in both Isfahan and Nathanez, where uranium treatment is carried out.
Question of children suffering from malnutrition: No morning and no beer
More than three thirds of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have more rules; while 9 per cent of schoolchildren have a low weight, 5 per cent suffer from obesity.
According to a recent study, children who suffer from obesity are usually from families with poor health.
Again, we see the importance of the environment and models of human behavior for him or her health development.
For example, it appears on the tables of children suffering from childbirth almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of children suffering from light if the use of the cartridge is free of charge for an educational activity called Fire is not an accident.
Moreover, families of children suffering from ageing are not involved in sports, but in most of today's schoolchildren, only 15 per cent said that their parents had time for sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last school year; it involved nearly 900 primary classes throughout the country.
Fuel activities were not an accident during the second year of the run, with the support of the insurance company General Health Insurance and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 students from 4-8 classes have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and adequate sports load are the main factors that cause a sharp increase in the number of children who suffer from excessive weight or fatigue.
"For example, only half of the respondents said they eat five times a day on the breakfast-percus-percus-use scheme, as this is one of the unprepared conditions for proper nutrition," says one study.
No lunch and no dinner club.
Experts warn that even relative details such as regular family breakfast are important for health development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of schoolchildren are attending school together.
In most families, everyone goes apart.
It has become more evident that people in every 10 families do not get involved.
And yet tomorrow is the basis of the right day-to-day reasoning.
The study showed that burned food is often used in families with children suffering from ageing.
Almost every one - regardless of weight - five soft drinks per day (70 per cent).
Although more than 40 per cent of children are regularly involved in sports, this figure is lower than two to 15 per cent when it comes to their parents.
Build your own menu.
In another study for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), it was proposed to draw up their own menu based on the proposed products and based on their tastes and preferences.
"Probation in food for Czech children 12-15 years of age is far from the idea of health food."
Their favorite food includes a large number of bitter, minced and sweet flowers.
"Special concern is the high popularity of sweet ice cream," says the final part of the study.
As the main target of the wild beast, the bird has won a small carriage.
However, children were practically not interested in baby, fish, and fruit.
Healthy Life - Styles
The study also showed that children were ready to change their eating habits, provided that they would be provided with relevant information.
‚ÄúMany of the participants in the study control group showed a significant shift in preferences for healthy food when they completed the questionnaire after completion of the Fire lecture,‚Äù says the outcome of the project.
This was particularly noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet cold drinks - more children have become preferable to water.
In addition, children have often observed birds and fish as the main flower, limiting the number of sweet flowers and spices.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, who claims professionals.
In the first article on trainers, I visited information on introductions.
I had no idea what was going to happen.
Lessons from three experts in this area; advice on how to choose clothes for non-standard figures; and seminar on how all of this works in real life.
More, more.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks are waiting for us.
Training takes every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really contaminated.
This time, with Alenko, Director, (no man at the course), we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not ideally symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
In one short shoal, in another small figure without proper shape, there is one more rule.
The stylist must know how to reduce the large sheets, remove the sheet or add the missing amounts.
We were given advice on how to highlight the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopes, that is, the owner of a more fat breast and breast and earpiece plate, and not to wear them too challenging.
For example, if the difference in the size of the plate and the belt is so large that it can't handle a hole or a bridge, there should be at least one thing I'd like to ask.
You're obviously not asking for funds because the ideal seating suit is worthless.
In the jukebox you'll feel a lot better than in the one who's always going down, hangs up, beats the plate, etc.
Men with boys' figures, on the other hand, can wear clothes with pinks, applications, uppers or boards.
In view of the abundance of such information and types of figures, I'm glad I have a whole week to realize that.
Still, I'm afraid it's too much, given the homework we've got.
Each participant had to think of two sets for any significance: day and night.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style of dress and figure.
I need to wear Miranda Kerr, which you can know about Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I'm glad about myself because it's much easier to wear than I say, Britney Spears, Christine Aguiler, who has recently been turned into a ton (please, see what I'm doing), or a young Selen Gomes.
We need to get out of the magazines or find it online, print and process it using graphical programs.
Mudbold -- called the result of the work -- then reflects our own style and the relation to the graphic image.
It is important to keep in mind the graphical composition style.
The stylist not only wears real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions, such as fashion bags, palto, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us about.
But it was just in the resurrection.
The stylist needs common knowledge
Three experts in this area have been interviewed by the sub-prime lesson.
Stylist, Honsa Pokorna; fashion designer, Jacob Polanca; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is illusion and the stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist is able to use one item of clothing in different ways.
In this case diversity is the key to success.
For example, the thumb can normally be worn, the top of the gins and the footballs, such as the thumb; but it can also be worn on the head without any restraint as a payment.
Another option is to hold your hand or lift your spindle, and the whole picture is completely changing.
"Play with him," he stressed.
In any case, I appreciated the following advice: "You must know the rules for your work."
Then you can start to break them," Jacob told us.
I finally realized here why we're going to mix all the definitions and rules, what to do with, and why, when we often see something else in fashion magazines.
I'm not talking about fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I knew that the style should have more options than the number of photographs he needs to make.
Yes, for a modular ten-page review (equivalent to ten lines) I must be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that the painting of clothes often looks and works in conjunction with others rather than in reality.
We must have this in mind when we create images.
Honz Pokorna confirmed that the image and style are often half the success.
Just look at Madonna, which doesn't have an empty circle, but her image and marketing turned it into a world star.
The treatment of stylist services in the Czech Republic is still quite cold.
Even well-known people often consider it a waste (and believe that it is enough to be an expert in something and how they look secondary).
And if someone else lets us create their style, we should expect them to call us less than what they really wear.
Then we go to Google and find out if the tables didn't write anything about some of the significance of the burial/circumcision, etc.
On the resurrection of Honza and Mario, emphasis was placed on the lack of understanding of fashion and ability for the stylist.
Our work is primarily from the people we dress; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
In order to be able to evaluate people, not to create them, and to maintain their opinions.
"If the manager asks you to look at her dress and add a few beautiful things, you can't throw out all her wardrobe, tell her that her clothes are terrible."
"Find even a few things you can praise, and advise that you can wear with them," says Mario.
He also showed us that we must put in particular the working bag.
It's a bag you tie around the plate to carry everything you need.
In addition to such visible substances as knives, slippers, or English beads, it must contain no wool (styles use it in the shorts of some items, such as bags or shoes), special clips for the back-stamping of the back if it is too large (bullets and similar items are forbidden because they are worn) or a set of silk.
To get rid of the lessons and get some practical experience, we learned to make notes on the back of the case.
Even during summer summers in the studio where half of the cold weather can get hurt, I'm not talking about street summers.
And here we were.
You don't have to touch your shoes so you don't export them.
This requires this skill.
I'm glad Mario praised my work.
These skills did not come to me by myself.
It's just part of what we've heard during the second part of the day's outing.
I'm starting to understand that being a professional stylist is not as easy as they would say.
V Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
Review
What was supposed to be a matter of concern turned into a routine morning trip to work because of the series of minor and indirect errors.
The ambitions were met to a certain extent, but this was not important, since no one apparently wanted to do any other work.
By the end of the new version with the title "Beautiful" had brought great hopes.
It was expected to set up the previous series needed For Speed in a new direction; demonstration versions showed that the game would take a decent place in the genre of race games.
We loved to see parts of the game where the main hero comes out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, the result is very different from what we expected.
The game is a rather harmless arcade race, but overall pressure is due to a number of unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series for years.
This means, in fact, not a mistake, but an unexplained line of developers.
The conclusion is very good.
You're part of a story, the main hero, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by taking part in an illegal race through America.
You're sitting in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
This idea has several interesting features.
The route consists of ten phases divided into more than fifty runs.
This means that each race is going its way, each stage is going in a different and interesting environment.
So there is no sense that the game is always the same.
Although the graph is at the same level as it is in the previous parts of the series, some terraces are pleasant to look at.
Still, the game does not cause strong emotions.
Although driving a car through the desert, it is very pleasant to walk on steep slopes or high in the snowy mountains.
Moreover, time runs out for extraordinary detail.
For example, in the desert you fall into a sandy storm that is a significant reduction in visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you need to be careful not to fall into the valley.
Some races are well-defined.
There are several differences, but that's enough.
For some time you're trying to break up a few opponents (usually a normal race); then you're trying to improve time (the standard race with a second size); or you're dealing with one opponent.
In addition to all the other things, from time to time you're looking at the police, which is even more difficult for you.
The components are new.
It's just an interactive animation where most Jack's time is running away from someone and you're supposed to help him with the buttons you need at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much less than you could expect (all three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out that this is good for the game because it's not expected; given the above, it's one of the things that makes the game more interesting.
The criminal model follows previous models.
This means that it no longer represents something special, but it cannot be considered insufficient.
If you're looking for a real life model, you have to find somewhere else.
However, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic runners, although there are better options available on the market.
It's still very good.
However, problems are getting worse over time.
Unlike the driving models, the sound model isn't so good.
You don't expect complex transformations and collisions from this game, but if you don't have the idea of meeting with an object how your car will behave, something's wrong.
Usually, when you are driving or driving outside a flat stream, you are sometimes easily connected to another car, and at times your car has started to break down in a fairly similar situation.
Or the trees were broken.
This is no longer so important because of the system of relaunching, but it's enough to export pleasure.
The reboots are so that if you break or go away from the grass, the game will return you to the point where it broke.
However, only five reruns are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start a race from the very beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't get, but you can't trust it completely.
Sometimes there are not enough reboots, and you need to learn to have a separate track.
The important lack of game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some repetitions need to be done in a certain way, but you just don't sign up.
In other cases, you meet civil vehicles at a certain location in the same configuration, regardless of your first, fifth, five seconds earlier or one minute later.
This is especially reflected in situations where you see how your opponent easily passes between two vehicles moving in the opposite direction, while when you are there, the machines are already arranged so that you either need to cover them or to delete the speed.
It doesn't matter when you show up with them; it's all made so that the situation is always happening before your nose.
The contestants have other advantages.
During the game you discover several places where, regardless of time, the same opponent will attack you at the same place.
This is particularly evident at the end of the game, at a long bridge where you go in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent must stand before you no matter what.
The fact is, when he eats before you, he makes you look at one or more accidents in this area.
You can understand the attempt to make a game more interesting and full of adrenaline, but it is so obvious that it is soon starting to provoke frustration.
Unfortunately, despite the simple driving model, the game is so interesting and sometimes so full of events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's going on around you.
It doesn't matter what you're not allowed to jump -- a concept of fifty unique paths, a sequence of tracks or something else.
The idea of changing cars during the race is unusual.
You need to follow along on the way because that is why your car can change, even though in most cases what you already have is enough.
The machines are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars are for direct cuttings; and exotic supersporters for technical driving, for example, on high-speed trains.
The main mode of story mode is closely related to the mode of challenge mode; these are individual games you will know about during the game.
Here you are fighting for your personal business, as well as the eyes, common for the systems of challenge and story.
Many opportunities are available for higher driving levels: starting from the car and completing the profile.
In addition, the online Autolog feature profile, which, above all, compares the results you have achieved with the results of other games, and provides communication with the public.
There is another lack of understanding; this is an example of the last race in sequence.
You and your car fall into a tunnel of meters (we'll think so) where you're sleeping on the streets in the dark (we'll think so).
Your sydometer shows numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (let's think so) when you're on the rear of the metro, turning your car into a heavy metal.
For a few days, our editor has discussed whether we really didn't think about any seconds during the game, or what its authors really think of us as such diseases.
The technical composition of the games is nothing special; but the overall printing of the video is pleasant, sometimes even exciting.
Although it is sad that in some critical times, the quality of the record is sometimes very strong, it is not.
This is particularly true of large numbers of participants, where a good record would not be particularly helpful to you.
Sounds okay; soundtrack is on the fan.
In order to match the widest possible young audience, the soundtrack 'composing compositions from different styles'; but almost everyone buys a game because of its music.
General impression of Need for Speed: Running is quite wrong.
If the game were to avoid obvious unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that escape is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
In any case, the game leaves a sense of perfection.
Of course, that's a good pleasure, but be prepared that your shortcomings will blind you as an airport designer.

Ambassador to the EU Vice-President:
The Czechs have the reputation of non-profits and sceptics for the euro.
"The Lisbon Treaty has caused significant differences between individual organizations."
"I didn't expect such a cruel war."
"It takes five or six years before the situation is stabilized, calms down and all games are used to play their new role," EU Ambassador Milane Vicenova strongly began his lecture at the legal college.
She proved how much her drive "Clarifying and open about Europe" was maintained in the first part of her lecture, where she described the individual EU institutions and their relations so simple and understandable that many lecturers from the KU legal college would challenge them.
Moreover, Vice-President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompey, commended the work of Vice-President of the European Council:
"At first the critics said that it was a traditional fairy-tale official mouse that could not play any role; I must say, everything was hit as well as it did with its role."
"The person who can listen to twenty-seven States parties at the same time has a wonderful opportunity to communicate with them and has a clear idea of the extent to which the EU needs to develop."
She explained her new position on international relations and security issues in response to the question, "Who is the European Union? What number should I call for?" i.e. an important step towards unification and greater transparency of the Union's policies with respect to countries such as China or India.
No one's going to stop our tears.
The evaluation has continued to focus on a programme key to the EU in the past, the present and the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency successful last year.
The Czechs had a business with an overcrowding financial crisis; they had overcome the crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the Government ' s withdrawal at the time was a negative phenomenon, with the least harm to the Czech Republic.
The Czech representatives are currently very busy in the EU.
As the Ambassador and the Presidency said, and the next financial crisis has resulted in ongoing resentment.
At the same time, it is necessary to adopt a new EU semi-annual budget, which is very simple in view of the current crisis.
The budget will be modest and economic, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support and which will be less; all these issues will be addressed in the future programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels, "O Europe, I understand."
"I really don't like the cuts, the foreign words and the jargon that nobody understands.
How can citizens understand that people in Brussels are not trying to sell bloody or round guns, bananas of different sizes, or someone is going to ban our kind of cheese."
It is also going to use the EU's environment more effectively and attract more teasing into European organizations.
Multispeed Europe - Our Future
The Ambassador claims that the Czechs consider them to be Euro-Sceptics, as well as the people who notice more negative rather than positive aspects of the matter.
She wants more Czech representatives to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that there are several factors involved: for example, the humility of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; while with little support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she noted the strength and cooperation of the High-Growd Group.
"Believe me that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and the word joins us, the French say to me, 'Hey, what is the reason for the assembly, the Multi-Grade?' and he doesn't like it either.
In the future, the Union of Vienna looks forward to the new strict rules for the budgetary policy of States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of double-speed, if not more realistic in Europe.
"We have both countries inside and outside the Eurozone."
"We have Schengen area, and we already have an institution for enhanced cooperation."
"First it was said that the countries that want to unite should be united, while those who do not want to remain on the side."
"The number of such institutions will increase; this will be a two-speed Europe now," Vicenov expects.
In this regard, it stressed the role both of the Czech Republic and of Herman Van Rompea in the promotion of the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all States parties, not just those in the Eurozone.
Brand History:
The IBM novator enters the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find a word that best expresses the IMB strategy, it'll probably be "long".
For the general public IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered to be very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's debt was fixed by its first boss, dreamer Thomas J. Watson.
He believed in his dream that many world problems could be solved easily if people wanted to think.
His slogan "Domaina!" thus became a print that developed the life of a future giant (also called his internal journal, which IMB started publishing in 1935).
Moreover, this was the basis of a corporate culture that Watson had carefully exposed.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means a constant move to the future.
IBM survived and thrived for a hundred years because he remained faithful to his significant values, although he was not afraid to change everything around him.
In our first century, this allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second century we hope to achieve even more," says current company leader Samuel J. Palmizano on the case of Jubilee.
Complicit system
In the 1930 ‚Äô s, Watson came to the point of looking after workers like Batya in the Czech Republic, IMB staff were among the first American employees to be paid leave, insurance from employer, elegant uniform and complex bonus system for the better developers and entrepreneurs.
The same has been the long-term relationship between IBM and consumers.
From the very beginning, the company had found the use of talented people, one of the first world companies to eliminate all discrimination that had given it a different choice.
It is in line with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan by which a woman, Virginia Rometti, will be replaced by Palmizano next year.
She worked in IBM for thirty years; she is currently a sales, marketing and development director.
Over the last few years IBM has organized online brainstorms, during which many future innovations have occurred.
Not surprisingly, the idea of a lot of people working in the company is about half a million people.
Organization with a good reputation
The firm's strong position in business is guaranteed by a strong internal and external image.
"From the very beginning, IBM concept was an organization rather than a technology company," said Professor Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosebeth Moss Canter.
"The IBM is not a technology company, it is a company that helps solve business problems with technology," adds George Coloni from Forrester Research.
As stated in the company itself, there is a difference between going out on the market and creating it.
For one hundred years IBM, or the Global Giant, as it is called in the United States because of its evil type, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It is said that it is the most universal technology company, which is developing equipment and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services, from servers to nanotechnology.
It has the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, and five of its staff have received the Nobel Prize.
Its products include, for example, banknotes, bank cards, financial swaps, strip codes and discus.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM has become the second largest technology company (first place in Apple) in this year, and Microsoft has been the first one since 1996.
Look Forward
Not all of its products have come to the taste of buyers and entered into the era. For example, IBM has failed with its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy online service and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is determined by moving forward, you can't be emotionally tied to the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM is easily based on several platforms -- if they don't work, it's rejected.
For example, it differs from its Microsoft competitor, which is based on and survives fall on Windows, its operating system.
Perspective technology
The main income of IBM comes from services, about one fifth of which comes from computer programs and equipment.
As in 1990, with both less capital, she was the strongest equipment manufacturer company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets of $15 billion, while at the same time investing 58 billion in future technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis first hit the world.
IBM follows the example of its first Director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment in the years of the Great Depression.
Until now, IBM seems to have caused no damage to the current crisis.
Since 2008, IBM's share price has increased by 120 per cent; the company's net earnings have grown steadily.
The corporate currency IBM is to change everything except its own values.
So we can expect that even if another crisis occurs, this flexible giant will face the situation.
IBM History: From Red knife to Space Flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago. Its original name was "Calculation Corporation, Tablets, Records".
She took the name IBM in 1924, which was called the brand used for company offices in Canada and South America.
The foundation of IBM's future was founded by four companies that began in the 1880s.
They had technologies such as the legendary "table hours", i.e. the time when staff members came and went to work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who also led the company's board of directors by 1930.
Flint hired the director of the competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
The leader then handed down the IBM-based idea of Watson as the basis for an undisclosed corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as it is clear from the name, started from the production and sale of various equipment for business - from raw knives and measles to cassava equipment.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, the deal had doubled to nine million dollars, and a large company expansion had begun on all continents.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later he took his son, Thomas Watson-young.
Under its guidance IBM began to develop the technology of artificial intelligence and created the first programming language.
In 1960 both staff and IBM computers helped NASA control space flights - in Mercurie, Saturn, and in 1969 - man flights in Luna.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer family - IBM line System/360 in 1964.
The classic PC, which established computer standards at that time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Over the past 20 years IBM has sold the production of computers by the Chinese company Lenovo, while purchasing the PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting office, thus focusing fully on consultancy and services with a high added value.
Over the last three years IBM has achieved great success from its concept of Smarter Planet.
Its objective is to use technologies in areas where this has not yet been planned and to improve road conditions and urban management.
In the area of business IBM has recently presented a Smarter Commerce platform that helps businessmen to control the entire trading cycle.
IBM's traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM founded its office in 1932.
Today IBM CZ is also managing the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters of Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where there is also a World-level Study Group on the Recognition of Words.
Reuters about her unbelieving husband:
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
Darina Richterzova (53) said it's over!
After her husband, Joseph Rihtarz (53), became the television and lover of Ivet Bartosh (45), Darina still hoped that he would be home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wanted to wait, and she set clear rules for her future life.
"The Pope may come home, but not like my partner," explained Richterzov.
When Darina Richtarzo was given the blood of Bartosh‚Äôs home by the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And although she let Eve get out of Ryan 30 days later, Pepa didn't leave the song.
Moreover, he publicly acknowledged that he loved her.
After a while, Darina was married, and she saw that she had made peace with a Roman husband; and now she finally apologized to him.
I'm putting everything in order like his wife's sleeping with.
Even if Richter and Bartosh are ever separated, his wife won't accept him with scattered charges.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will make him."
"Then he will end his days not as my beloved, lost and found old bitch, but the man with whom I have something to do with me," said Richterzov, adding that she has already been freed from her husband and continues only on a common basis.
Until Joseph had nothing to do with his wife‚Äôs rejection of him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Evete, I'm not going to change it."
"My wife decided to leave a marriage on the book, and I respect that decision."
"Our Union continues to work; I'm responsible for repairs, now, home and shopping."
"Darina and I are together perfectly normal, only we don't share a bed anymore," said richtharj magazine Blesk.
He claims that if Richard finds new love, he won't interfere with it.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she's with or if she's got a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Eve and I'm taking full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
The most common among women are those who say, "Do they belong to you?"
When you ask men to name some typical bad female habits, they usually list them all immediately.
Dear ladies, do you know yourself in the following lines describing several female customs that force men to commit crimes?
Schoping
Your second half is sorry you're always going to stores?
You need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping for big sales?
If so, your shopping can be considered a stupid habit.
Some women recognize that they need to control their passion for shopping.
And who among you would turn away from the clothes stores in search of an ideal seating suit and an example of it (in various colors) in illustrations?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men it can be the same person.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait for you to get married...
An Eternal Disillusionment
"I'm too tired?"
"I need to get rid of at least five kilograms -- can I start doing gym?"
"Are you still getting to me?"
Do you know those phrases?
Yeah?
Then you go into a group of women who are mixed up in their own way.
You don't have to stop following yourself, but many men are literally allergic to constant complaints of their partners in their appearance.
The strong gender also agrees that the more such complaints occur, the more women respect them.
The most important order and purity
It's like an endless story.
My glass, my turbulence, my sex, my anti-fouling, my bath cleaning -- at least twice a week.
You're critical of your partner because he's on a clean cupboard in dirty boots; children on a clean armpit and fingerprints on a window glass in a guest that was so hard to clean?
If you are suffering from this ‚Äúdisregarding‚Äù, try to see that it‚Äôs too bad to fall; and that your family‚Äôs order and cleanliness should not be put first.
The desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationships as well as the entire family.
Commanding
"Brush the white in the corner."
"Are you going to put on your bad nose tomorrow?"
"The softest man for the jury should not be on the ground."
If you make your partner‚Äôs comments several times a day, he or she may be very helpful.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood this, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Spleen
Some women would like to scream, scream, and scream at others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, who, and why.
From time to time, it's probably each one of us who lets out.
Let's be open, that's the most visible nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious cases of women who are frequently abusive and prejudicing others, especially in women's working groups, who are more likely to be in danger of their environment.
The resulting transfers of Yagra and Voracek have helped Philadelphia to win
During the NHL match on Monday, two successful handovers of the hockey attacker Jaromire Jagra helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on the Queen's wing, and it was again the most effective Czech match game.
In both cases, Claude Giru used the experience of a thirty - nine - year - old star; he added another translation and was announced as a best match game.
Two successful match transfers also belonged to the player in one team with Yagro Jabubu Waraƒçek.
After the match, Jagr told foreign journalists that he had predicted the big night of Jiru.
"I told him before the match that he'd kill a hit trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel that way," explained Jagr, after his actions, Giru killed the ball at the first opportunity that Fleers gave.
A little later, the second floor of the team also had a Czech post.
The closing Harrickins Waraczek took over the boat and handed it over to Maxim Talbota, who killed between the circles.
In the second before the first break, Patrick Dwyer reduced the gap by a number of benefits, but at the beginning of the second team, Fleers was back.
Especially Jiru.
Following the successful release of Yagra, he killed a third of his men; his attack was later transformed into the fourth round by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean to say that he's the best league game, but he's exactly three better," said Jagr, praising his central.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey game like him at the end of my career."
"That makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in NHL my teammates have tried to help me, and now my turn has come," Jagr added.
The Queen has made a more dramatic match with Tuomo Rutu and Dwyare's Penals, cutting down to one head.
Further complications prevented Matt Reid, who increased the gap between two glasses.
"Pronger was doing great in our area."
"He hit on his shoulder, I rushed, and Reid moved on to the other side."
"I'm looking forward to it and I'm glad it worked," Waracek described his impression from the last round of the match.
The victory led to the first place in the East Conference in Philadelphia.
Commander Montreal Chech Yaroslav Schpaƒçek has not finished his fight with Buffalo; he has left the game in the second period due to the trauma of the upper body.
Along with an experienced Canadian protector, they lost their double advantage and lost 2:3 after the Penalty Series.
Thomas Plekanez couldn't kill during one of their attacks.
More than lost eyes, the home trainer was hit by a large number of traumas in the back row as the fight ended with five guards.
"The situation is bad."
"We've finished the game with only one game of experience, the rest were young people."
"In any case, we can't do anything about it, we just need to make peace with it," said Jack Martin.
"The replacement was empty and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the boat out of our area."
"What was our weak side," added P.K. Subban.
After thirty attacks by Chechnya Uncle Paulez helped Winnigues win Tampa Bay 5:2.
Gol Jets, who stopped the fifth series of attacks, were killed by five different games.
Price dynamics for travel since 1989
Until 1989 only five public tourist agencies could work in the former Czechoslovakia: ƒåedok, Sportsturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, tourism agencies at the time were mainly selling tourism in the countries of the socialist block.
Thus, Czech tourists were on their way to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea at the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries at the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, resulting in significant restrictions on travel by Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The major paradox of the socialist period was that the socialist block (i.e. Czechoslovakia) was not allowed to travel by individual socialist countries.
If a Czech citizen wanted to go on his own, for example, in the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter was needed from that country; otherwise, individual travel was impossible.
At the time, tourist agencies offered to travel to the West, but they had to stand in the middle of the night with a sleeping bag or have good friends in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
Monetary leave was required for travel to the West, and it was not granted to politically untrustworthy people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czech currency was not freely converted; it was not possible to obtain funds (the Western currency) for travel to the West without a currency permit.
Most importantly, the Czechs have taken their leave at home, which has led to the emergence of a large number of cottages and summer houses, which remains the custom today.
Since 1989 tourism in Chechnya has thus survived this revolution.
While travel in GDR or Bulgaria was a culmination of our journeys by 1989, over the past year, Czechs had spent 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are no longer aware of is that we were unable to visit the most popular in Croatia by 1989 because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In the early 1990s, the need for visas in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe was lifted, which began to be a huge wave of short trips mainly in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechs could never travel to the West, and they all wanted to go there even though they were on the move.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in palaces, as their income was not then caught at a hotel or a pension.
The typical characteristic of Czech tourism during that period was the desire to bring its own food (conservatives, salts, etc.) to save money.
Another important moment is the introduction of a freely converted Czech crown. After decades our tourists can finally buy the Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income grew, which had led to another important situation around 1997.
Since 1997, an increase in demand has enabled tourist agencies to prepare regular flights carried out by charter airlines.
By the end of the 1990s, there was no need for visas to visit virtually all the developed world countries except the United States, which made our journey even easier.
The following significant developments in post-conflict travel history took place in 2000, leading to the historic first direct straight journey from the Czech Republic to the exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter trips have been made by Czech tourists in hot exotic countries, and this winter flight from the Czech Republic will be sent on 12 exotic routes.
Currently, some 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another important event of this period, which symbolized our post-conflict development, took place in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States withdrew the need for visas for Czech tourists and our country has always joined the world ' s most developed countries.
First in history in 2008, more than half of their leave was abroad (50.3%); first in history they spent more than 15,000 dollars per person during the leave of absence, including their costs in the appointment.
The General Assembly must elect the President, and the threat of the road is returned
For about five months there was no president in the Czech football, and there is a risk that the transferor of Ivan Gashek, head of the Czech Football Association (FAƒåR), will not be called even after another extraordinary general assembly, which will be held in Nimburg on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on what rules of elections should be followed.
Without this vote, one of the three candidates would not start.
The Indians Rachel, Miroslav Pelta and Thomas Paclik want to lead the Czech football.
Gashek left his post in June, and he called out to his colleagues to join and find a strong personality that would lead a football future.
Nevertheless, the Eera Gashek again loaded a football between the two Boards of Association which could not elect a single candidate.
This was apparently on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly appeared at the National House in Prague, Smile, as the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the electoral procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only legal representatives or officials who had been authorized.
This point has been partially resolved since then by the recommendations of the Institute of State and Law, which provides that a delegation based on the powers conferred is not possible.
Disputes about electoral rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board has also not been very helpful in its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, in particular.
The presentation of voting methods has changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: How can we go around 3 and avoid the road?
"The issue is whether to follow the rules or to find another model," said one of the Vice-Presidents of FAƒåR Dushaan Free, who represents a professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the model provided for by the Constitution, the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate who has received much support from the Chamber from which he is a candidate.
According to the compromise, Moravia is considered the winner of the candidate ' s election with the highest number of votes in both Chambers.
The Czech side insists that, in a general interest ratio, the winner should raise at least two thirds of the votes.
"However, the two previous rounds would then have lost their meaning; this would have completely rejected the concept of two Chambers," the Freedom agreed with the evidence of Moravia; he said it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing rules.
Some unexpected Thomas Paclik agrees with him, although, according to the evaluation of the rules of elections set out by the Constitution, more than other candidates are killing Pelta.
"I'd like the elections to go to the highest level."
"I want to avoid all possible representational foolishness as in the previous general assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plze≈à, who is the first candidate; and in his statement he was in chief opposition to Pelte.
Pelta remains optimistic.
He believed that the new President would be known in Hamburg; he hoped that future candidates would cooperate constructively.
"All emotional tension will rest after today's expected departure from the national assembly at the European Championship."
"Football will again be in a happy mood, people will be more willing to cooperate," said the representative of Yablonec. Of the three candidates, he has more experience in football management both at the professional and regional levels.
Rachel's more of a prisoner.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very different."
"It's not between the representatives of God and Moravia, but there's an attempt to adapt to the rules."
"It can cause another disturbance in the general congregation."
"I hope health will win," said Rachel.
There was not much time left for the parties to reach agreement.
According to some reports, individual negotiations have taken place directly in Montenegro; but whoever knows whether football unity will be achieved before the match.
In addition to other Vice-Presidents of Dalibar Kucheru and Raichla in Podgorica, the additional trip was not taken out of Prague in the morning due to technical inaccuracies.
At the end of the Minister ' s meeting, which is expected in the middle, may become decisive.
The Minister for Education, Youth and Sport, Joseph Dobesh, would like the parties to the most powerful sports association in the country to agree.
Many of the cards are provided: government subsidies; football credit; and the planned CSTV General Assembly with a new Czech Sports Directorate following the financial problems of Sazka.
The Pacilli is in the presidential struggle because he does not see the appropriate candidate
If the head of the football team had seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting of the head of the football team, which would have been in line with all its requirements to the President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAƒåR), he would not have even claimed a high position.
"If there were a decent candidate, I would fight for him and not take part in the fight."
"But this man hasn't been found before," said Paclik ƒåTK.
Motif Paclica, in order to get into the fight against the Peacekeepers Pelt and the Indian Reichlom, is trying to stop Pelt, the alleged election favor, from entering the FAQR administration.
Furthermore, Paclik stressed that in the event of his victory, he would remain the president only until 2013 when a regular general meeting was scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be taken by an experienced football manager, not too related to football.
"I talked to a few people who might be in a way."
"It was terrible for me to hear some of them say they don't even want to have a relationship with the Czech football right now."
"I would like to change this opinion," he said.
The main difference between Paclica and Pelt is currently related to relations between the last Roman Berbro, President of the Regional Football Association in Plzene. Berbr is a man of opposite reputation known as an influential lobbyist capable of affecting the voices of the delegates of the General Assembly.
Paclik thus considers it unacceptable that Pelta should be president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and the football will not move forward."
"With the support of Berbra, a capable businessman, this would be even more harmful to football," Paclik said.
He was referring to the fact that several years ago the name of Pelti was written during the hearing of the telephones in the investigation of corruption; Pelte was able to avoid punishment.
"I don't know what a victory for Pelt would bring a football."
"And how do we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik.
If Paclick wins on Thursday, he could cooperate with Pelt in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Rachel, whom Paclik supported before the General Assembly in September of the end of the Fascist.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd ever call."
'He's very capable.'
"I can present it in the head of the collection."
"But he can't control the association."
"I am also not a burden in what I don't understand," said Paclik, who drew a great deal of attention to himself in September when he supported the removal of the trial brigade, led by the Man of Macelo, by Dagmar Damkova.
Pacli claims he's at risk of running an association.
He recalled his experience in the management of private companies; since last summer he has managed the Plyzn team, which with his help opened his first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the power to force the football environment to change, support its changes for the better."
"To limit the influence of some groups of people who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals council that leads to adverse situations," Paclick said. He did not hide his anticipation, for example, to Sparta Daniel Cr≈æetinski.
One of its priorities will strengthen the relationship between the FAQR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it will assist in the highest political level in the allocation of more money for sport from the lottery.
"This is one of the key moments for the new President to take over."
"If taxes are imposed on gambling, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where money will go," he said.
The Paclic does not consider its connection with the Plyzne Club to be a burden, although he claims that President FAƒåR should be independent.
Pelta's related to Jablonec, and Rachel's with the Old Duke.
"It's not an ideal option."
"And yet I can't see the meaning of giving my shares to someone else's club, once I'm going back there in six months," says Paclik.
Pelta promised new FAƒåR rules to avoid the electoral path
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates in the presidential capacity, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for new FACHR rules in order to avoid future debates on electoral rules.
Prior to the negotiations on Thursday in Nimburg, Jablonec's officer remains optimistic and believes that the attention of the pre-election struggle will be sensitive to today's expected success of our football club.
Prior to the elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and financial resources.
He decided to take part in the elections recently before the last general meeting, so that he could have a two-month delay so that his ideas about football could be useful to him in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the President to be known on Thursday."
"They feel that it is the right time for someone to lead the association," says a person who is primarily associated with the Jablonec Club; but he has spent many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.
This gives him reason to assume he's experienced enough to manage a Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that reigned during the reign of Ivan Gashek.
"Unfortunately, rules that were not as perfect as we thought were adopted at the June General Assembly."
"If the various forms of representation were not adopted, we would already have been President since September," said Pelta.
It refers to the rewriting of the civil association's key document as a false purpose for delegates.
"If I become the president, I will consider it my personal task, and I am going to take responsibility for myself if this attempt seems unsuccessful."
"This is a fundamental issue without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.
In addition, he said that he was not trying to give himself up on the basis of opponents.
In the past, he had already stated that he could submit his cooperation with Indry Rahl, whom he appreciated for legal education; he was fully aware that his candidate had to become his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he didn't attack Thomas Paclica, who was constantly critical of Pelta.
"He's been on football for more than a year and has achieved some success."
"In any case, his attacks were inconsequential, and many people were amazed at the methods of his pre-election campaign."
"And that's why some of them now doubt his true identity," said Pelta about his competitor.
He considered his main weapon to be knowledge of football from the lowest level to the national collection.
The national assembly must represent all the football.
"I would also try to put an end to all incidents, beginning with the bombings or the effects of the last year's corruption scandal."
"Soon after that, I would focus on negotiations with both the private and public sectors in order to guarantee enough money for all football," said the CTC two months ago.
He then promised that his election as head of the football team would not delay the disbanding of personnel.
"I will need to know the official instructions of individual staff," which was his mission to the Department, where the duration of the interdepartmental period was a source of considerable nervousness.
Despite the current disaster scenarios of the planned General Assembly, he believed that the four delegates would not arrive in Nimburg immediately.
"If the only controversial question is how to make a third round of elections, we can deal with it."
"The football needs a trust that he can only have chosen the end of his leader," says Pelta, who remains optimistic for two days until the key day of his career.
Rachel promises that, under his leadership, the FAQR will be active
If, at the fourth meeting of the Yindraji Rahl, the Vice-President, becomes the President of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association will not listen.
Rachel promises that if they choose him, he will have a hard time working hard.
He would like to make changes to the system and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for certain areas of football.
He also promised to address the problem of the heretics; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; raise more money into football; and continue the work of former President Ivan Gashek.
"As president, I would like to focus on football in general."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national collection, professional football and youth football activities".
"Well, I don't want to say what I'm doing myself," said Rachel in her interview to the Czech Republic.
"I am a team game, and I want to allocate powers to the Executive Committee so that each member focuses on a particular area."
"I'm going to give the task a good deal so that in each of these segments the football will take a great step forward."
"This is probably not what many people like, because it will mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement had supposedly challenged him as a candidate.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if there's any meaning in this; and that I'm not surrounded by people who put me in my wheelchairs and who doubt my every step," he explained his doubts.
"However, many people told me that I shouldn't give up, otherwise others would come."
"It's a trust I can't undo," he said.
Moreover, he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to interrupt all of this."
"There have been processes that can produce results over a few years, and I do not want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, would be selected, the situation in the Association could return to what was before Gashek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's whether the competent Mirek Pelta is quite competent."
"It's surrounded by people who would take the football to make it available only to the chosen ones."
"I can blame myself a lot, but I'm not really subjective anymore."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone, because then it'll be a good time, not just a select minority," said Rachel.
Moreover, he accused him of being the only President of the Czech Republic.
"Although many people are trying to approve back, I'm planning to make the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider the division of the second line into the Czech and Moorish parts of which the winners would continue to fight in the first league."
"This will prevent the current situation when there are only three Moorish teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Rachel said.
While in the presidential struggle, the director of the Plyzny Thomas Paclik club, Rachel is not ashamed to assess his chances of winning.
"However, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as my Vice-President, and I see that I have achieved some obvious success," said Rachel.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Acknowledging that Pelta was "excluding from the process of returning credit to the Czech football", he considered another opponent, Paclica, a strong candidate with what he had to offer.
"No one can doubt that he worked so well in Plzene this year."
"If he is elected, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashek started without significant changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't be able to tell the facts for his benefit," said Rachel about her opponent.
The most beautiful bases in Europe
Swim into the water
Julia Stanek
Children's pools with a universal volcanic perspective and state-of-the-art bases in Budapest. Travelers can experience the incredible water of Europe - and weaken the body in the Jacuzzi after a city or a long walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder could not travel during his research trip for the last half of the year: without his shopping suit.
While lying on the back of the water, she looked up at the beautifully shaped dome, walked up to the marble heroes waiting for it at the end of the pool and fell in love with carefully restored swimming pools in ar-new style.
She tried to add every favorite base to her block with important details about building and building history.
The Architect History of Meder has seen more than 200 sailing basins - and has now collected impressions in its recently published book Badefreuden (Currency Council) from public pools in Munich to historic shopping malls in the Black Forest and "functional concrete buildings" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it "traveled in the most unusual shopping malls in Central Europe" and visited buyers in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland - and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is the current enthusiasm for shopping culture.
She's trying very little enthusiasm about sports, says Meder, but in water it's all different.
The only failure is that the sailing worshipers should be at peace with the son of a coffee plate and the smell of oil, when refugees can drink the fake smell of the molasses or hear the happy cries of birds in the park.
"Sometimes I asked myself why the swimming pools should always be so terrible," says a living in Vienna Meder.
"So I began to collect beautiful bassies."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Swimming in the pool and looking for oil in the sauna is a health factor in shopping because, according to Meder, all emotions are stimulated.
And the swimming pools can be a pleasure for the eyes if the builders take on such work. "Instead of sex in the pool, you have a surface of water."
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is visible: high-shadows, colour plate and trampling.
The illustrated version of the 190-page "Currency Shopping" contains valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of health - and encourages you to swim in the water.
Meder's water collector discovered several outstanding specimens during a study in Hungary.
She discovered rich nitrates of water in the pasta cave (The Petsarium in Miskoltz-Tapolce) and a thermal bath filled with sealed water in a building built in the form of a bottle (V√°rosi Term√°lf√ºrd√∂ in Yasberne), as well as large therapeutic baths, such as 100-year-old Seƒçene baths in Budapest.
Many of the underground open pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, are open with an impressive view. You can see all the Cures from the bathroom on the roof or look at the snowy Arlberg from the open pool in Sanct Anton. And there is a window in the couple that allows you to see what's going on on the beach.
Perhaps the most unusual design is waiting for buyers in Langenfield, and the water supply in Ectale looks just like the NLO that lands in the Alps.
In the winter, a couple of three open raccoons are raised, which are said to be very small on the front of the Ectal Mountains.
Algambra in Schwartzwalde
Meder's pool collector didn't meet the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell a lot, and the purchase names of Arpad in Beckechba are so intense that you may find it hard to believe that you are in a health source.
Rain causes hydrocarbons in yellow water. The water is almost black from a well that fits into the skin as soon as you are loaded into a pool - a health experience of a particular type.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at a certain point in his search for beautiful shopping places, and when she tried to visit the open base of the Czech baths in Lugaƒçovicas, she discovered that the territory was printed.
The bathrooms designed by Architect Dusan Yurkovic in 1902 were closed.
When Meder looked at the appearances of a red-white-green building in the art-new style, she saw the roses that grew between the coffee boards.
One of the places where the destruction was halted by the burning tracks was a wonderful swimming pool in Schwartzwalde - The Garden of Waters in Bad-Wildbad.
The bassies have already passed through three stages of construction. You will find not only non-Roman elements since the building in 1844, but also the Mauritian Hall in the style of Algebra, which was added about 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Terminal House - a beloved swimming pool of Airis Meder - and not just because she was born from Schwartzwald.
"This achievement is so masterful to combine such different architecture styles," says Meder.
Getting to the terminal pool in such a yard is obviously a secondary occupation.
Speculation of agricultural production
Mother Bank is investigating the trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tevs
Will Douche Bank stop selling agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Akkermann commissioned the working group to investigate the impact of speculation on the poor around the world.
The Executive Director plans to amend it in January.
Hamburg
For German citizens the situation is clear: according to one study, 84 per cent of Germans consider it unacceptable that banks are speculating on agricultural products such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of the respondents demanded that Doyche Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products, as trade deepens the problems facing the poorest people around the world.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Institute for Social Studies and Statistical Analysis of Forsa by the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on the report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Garald Shuman, demonstrates that the world market rates are rising prices - and banks, thus contributing to global hunger.
The consumer interest protection campaign was directed directly against the head of Douche Bank Joseph Akkermann, although large bank houses, such as Goodman Saks and Morgan Stanley, are trading the same.
Prices for goods were thought to be a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that the games have rejected the rules of proposal and demand - and are based on the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akkermann responded to the criticism and promised to investigate the charges and stated that no trade "shouldn't have a good reputation of Douche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of Douche Bank with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to declare the following changes to the investigation at the end of January.
The trade in goods can be reduced or stopped.
Akkermann works on his image.
President Foodawtch Tilo Bod√© addressed the news, stressing his critical attitude to the financial sector. "The rise in food prices is a shocking example of how senseless banks are currently acting against common interests".
As the bank's main lobbyist in Akkermann has a certain responsibility, Bode believes.
"The daughter of the Bank must remove from the portfolio any investment that makes money at food prices," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if it's about starving people or the reputation of the Douche Bank."
The immediate reaction of Akkermann began to surprise him, but the Director would like to have a permanent picture of everything in a few months before his stay in the office.
Doache Bank announced on Monday that the President would not go to the Board of Supervisors as planned.
The removal of the underlying issue of speculation on the food market could improve its image.
He also has no need to be concerned about the costs - with consequences for his successor.
Every second would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
More than 30,000 Internet users joined the organization's campaign today.
The study was published on Tuesday, and the study was conducted for the Institute of Social Studies and Statistical Analysis for Forsa 7 and 8 November, and 1001 attended.
Not more than 11 per cent believe that investments at the food price are acceptable to Doyle Bank.
Many bank clients would also take concrete steps if they discovered that their bank was involved in such a trade, and according to the study, each second would withdraw contributions that ultimately lead to the speculation of goods.
43 per cent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 per cent would say they were thinking of closing the account and moving into another bank.
House of the 21st Century in Vienna
Paulon in New York City
Ingeburg Winsovski
Architectural history of the fall, fall and happy ending. Paul of Austria for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels hosted awards, became a museum in Vienna, and was abandoned and burned.
Now it's reopened as an exhibition center.
The Austrian Pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a well-known example of the modern-day architecture with its simple forms, glass halls, with strong faith in technical progress.
Pavilion Swanzer founded Gran-pri on architecture in 1958 for his simple steel and glass silver construction.
The building is considered to be very expensive in the modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built an Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
Finally, in 1973 he praised his legendary four - inch - long [4 cm] magazine BMW and its sister - in - law building.
Pavilion, thought to be a building for temporary exhibitions, was transferred to the Swiss garden around the south coast of Vienna, converted and opened as the 20th century Museum in 1962 - often referred to as the House of the 20th century.
In any case, the building was not suitable for a museum on technical and spatial considerations - it did not have a building on which art could be carried out and bad air conditioning.
However, it continued until the modern art in Vienna was acquired a new home.
The house has been abandoned since 2001, and its condition has become worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krischenitz has so far recovered a pavilion called the House of the 21st Century and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is the office of the Belveder Museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening, in all my thoughts, a happy event.
Agnes Hussleyn-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery of Belveder in 2007, contributed to a new start.
Hussleyn-Arco, a graduate of the School of Art History with a leading career in youth who worked in Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and, as a result, became the founder and director of the Modern Museum in Salzburg, convinced politicians and conservationists to continue their reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations and decided on how to use the building.
The new museum was to include a permanent exhibition of the fund of Frizza Votruba, coffee and bookstore together with modern art, and an office building was also to be built.
Strict control of & limited budget
The Christian was then an ideal candidate for the implementation of the project.
He was known, of course, because of the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secession Joseph Olbrich, and won a competition, but he also studied at the University of Vienna technology, and Pavilion was ‚Äúthe only important place‚Äù for him, where he visited the ‚Äúnear-weekly‚Äù exhibitions.
He knew the original design and the tasks that stood before the building, the building that had already lost part of its size and ease when it was transferred to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that have occurred during the recent reconstruction have been much more serious.
Window profiles on the glass phase were replaced, reinforced with glass safety glass, and glass panels replaced with high-quality safety glass.
The permanent translation of the heat bridge was either strengthened or replaced, and from generations onwards was taken apart.
Two lower stages have created space for the new use of the building, the burning light corridor between the building and the street provides lighting - practically new building, but still outstanding in the Swancer Pavilion.
The original outer doors were preserved, and the building was decorated in an old bright-green color protection from corrosion.
Hall's movie theater just like it used to be.
All of this is under strict control by the museum administration and by a limited budget.
"He often had to find material that was good, efficient and approved by the museum administration," Christianitz said, pointing to an unusual situation in the basement.
The building remained flexible and easy despite limitations, problems and changes.
A Christian observed recently that the "Brussels" Pavilion was a sad story of the typical "capples in the city".
Such architecture is ‚Äúnot always in its place‚Äù and however it wants to ‚Äústimulate this awareness‚Äù.
The 21st century's house is in a very good place, as the city's planning has been an unexpected success.
A second happy event can take place. The house of 21st century can be complemented by the second building of Christiana, a French collector of the Gabsburg Foundation, and it is reported to be negotiating with the city about its presence next to the Swiss garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a multimillion winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn has published an anti-crisis plan to avoid stopping winter trips.
The number of staff should be increased twice.
The cost is EUR million.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year in order to avoid winter breaks and delays in travel.
With reference to the internal anti-crisis plan Deutsche Bahn, Bill reports that investments are planned by around 300 million euros by 2015.
Investments are designed to improve the capacity of the local motorists and the railway network even under extreme conditions.
The number of personal and attractive staff working on snowboarding and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The aim is to clean the platforms from snow and ice to start work and 90 per cent of the necessary shots within four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of a rest and delay in the winter meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
In the past winter, Deutsche Bahn has experienced significant difficulties with passenger transport because it has not been able to make a reservation at the time of the deterioration of the conditions.
Many new regional trips were expected to be approved by the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays in ICE travel.
For many years also, Deutsche Bahn had been able to check the ICE travel axis more frequently after one of the ICE's voyages broke here on the main coast of Kelne.
Donche Bank pays a lot of millions of dollars in the United States
New troubles followed by the elections around Joseph Akkermann, Director General Douche Bank: Douche Bank is threatening US fines in many millions of sterling pounds.
According to Douche Banka, there was little problem with the family, the past industrial giant in the United States was now under pressure. Douche Bank with the headquarters in Frankfurt will pay $145 million (106 million) to settle the disputes that arose after the bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem arose around the sale of mortgages.
The National Credit Union Management Board (NCUA), the Financial Market Regulator, accused a number of major banks of using false promises to lure credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of the bonds fell short during the financial crisis and moved down credit unions.
"We are pleased that we have dealt with this problem without the attention of the parties to the court," said the representative of Doyche Bank in New York.
The bank did not recognize its liability in the agreement.
The same is true of the Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbi Matz welcomed the operational response of both banks.
The National Credit Union Management (NCUA) is responsible for the United States Credit Unions and is involved in the banking process in order to protect consumer contributions.
NCUA is fighting to compensate for losses of billions.
This is the first such agreement.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and raised the case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs last year.
Suspension mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by mortgage loans.
They are supported by internal loans.
This led to the trial of a number of financial companies when in 2007 the U.S. real estate market was hit.
The U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered long live in September 2008 in a crisis of financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have raised a large number of claims, demanding compensation or punishment for fraud.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is the largest claim.
It blames 18 major international banks for having concluded agreements with US credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for some $200 billion.
The Bank's daughter is also at risk of prosecution by FHFA for numerous agreements of the total value of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires a bank with headquarters in Frankfurt to take responsibility for "substantial losses" but has not yet indicated the exact amount.
The Bank rejected claims as unfounded and reported its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffet invests 10 billion in IBM
Buffet is actively investing in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares totalling over $10 billion.
The largest American investor, Warren Buffet, has always said that he is not investing in computers and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the IBM annual report changed its view on investments in this industry.
According to Buffet, it had to be much earlier to understand that IBM was first offering services and purchasing computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffet's investment has been considered a ricary step.
IBM, veteran IT adults, has now received the title "Serer IBM".
In an interview with the U.S. business telephony, CNBC Buffet reported that from March it had acquired IBM shares totalling $10.7 billion.
His investment holding Berkshire Hataway became one of the largest IBM shareholders of the shareholdings of 5.5 per cent.
Buffet said that even IBM had not known anything about his involvement in recent times.
He commended the management that was able to achieve even during the financial crisis.
"They've done a lot of work," said Buffet, meaning the management strategy.
A significant time for IBM was focused on high-income IT services such as data centres.
The founder of the computer industry, which has been providing software and advisory services for more than 100 years now, as well as powerful business computers.
Buffet's runaway technology companies.
He claimed that he only invests in those companies that he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the production of raw materials and in machinery.
His holding Berkshire Hataway has shares in the long list of larger companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (former Municher R√ºck), along with about 80 of its own subsidiaries.
At 81 years of age, he acquired a small textile company Berkshire Hataway in the 1960s and built on it one of the most expensive world companies.
His appearance of life, however, remained modest,
made it a cultural figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost innocent instinct in the matter of money brought him the name Oracula from Omahi.
The IBM share price increased by 1 per cent until market opening after Buffet's investment announcement.
The Big Giant, as IBM is still called, is worth more than $220 billion in the fund exchange, which makes it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world, together with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffet, however, said that he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder Bill Gates is his close friend.
Immortal danger
Following the discovery of the Turkish media in Zwickau, the law was challenged by the Turkish authorities in Germany.
One newspaper spoke of blood ideology, which is now being raised on the surface.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of a legal extremist ideology.
Fear and concern were a response to this communication in Turkey and in the German-Turkey community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has led to long forgotten fears, such legal extremism attacks on Turks have not occurred since the war in Melne in November 1992 and Zolinga in May 1993.
There has never been any doubt, however, that xenophobics exist in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremism network is now discovered to a degree that is not yet fully understood.
"The birth of blood ideology?" was the title of the online version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
Sabah, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret service informant and expresses concern that the German authorities could be involved in the law extremism.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) responded peacefully by replacing the victims of racial hatred with a silent anti-Brandenburg gates in these exits.
Two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin, with the participation of German and Turkish policies, noted the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkey bilateral employment agreement.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
The release in some Turkish media was like a disaster. The German gift to the fifteenth anniversary is the name of one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", a commentary on the murder series.
The German edition of H√ºrriyet also did not allow this parallel.
"It's starting to smell bad" is the name of the column of Ahmet Kuhlage.
He noted that people who paid taxes and their work had been killed had made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent success-of-the-art vessels has been strongly criticised by German-Turkey Internet forums.
The authors asked why the German authorities had not previously thought about following suspects in the areas of law extremism.
Some authors have come up with quite a short rhetoric. "If they continue to act the samely, migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves."
"It's gonna be the best self-defense."
"The world in Germany is very much dependent on how the whole network will be covered and the justice of punishment," says Selen.
The crimes in Melne and Zollingen in the 1990s were examples of the threat of peace in Germany.
The photographs of the ruins in Zollingen were deeply impressed by the memory of the Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown so clearly to the Turks living here that they are at risk, and to the Germans, that mistrust and equality can remain in real violence.
These crimes, however, increased the feeling of Turkish unity.
Do not repeat past errors
The Turkish press in this period mainly condemned the failure of the German police after the attacks, and Helmut Cole refused to visit the survivors in Melne.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the summit in Zolingen, but his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel took into account the taxes the Turks pay in Germany,
He said he defined the value of man's taxes it pays.
The current enlightenment in Turkish media has again shown how many German Turks have since been inseparable to the present German State.
He made it clear that efforts should be made to identify and reassess legal extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bank scandal in the Zurich Islands
Most of Europe's banking policy leaders are not in France or Italy but in Switzerland.
It was not easy to break up during the financial crisis, and since then it has been constantly fighting one, the other.
Now it's German to return it to the right course.
Alex Weber didn't suspect he had this role to play.
In July, following its effective care from the post of head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that it would begin its work on at least one effective post in 2013 as President of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss Bank of BB; an unexpected and successful career.
Alex Weber was clear on Tuesday, commended Switzerland for her beauty, commended Switzerland for her new strength and made several friendly comments to her future colleagues.
"UBS has been able to change for the better."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Fillinger and Oswald Gruble."
But it became clear in September that everything would be different.
Trader BB in London has broken the bank's security system and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The Executive Director of BB Oswald Grubel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the President of the Board of Directors of BB has been considered ill, and they all want to know: When will Alex Weber finally enter his post?
Weber should consult a bank since February 2012.
And as the bank said on Tuesday, it will take over in May, not in 2013.
This will not be easy for Alex Weber.
He is an economic teacher and a central bank specialist, not a traditional banker, and he will undoubtedly need time to adapt.
He was secondly responsible for the bank's strategy, which once again proved that it had long deserved the name of "the largest bank scandal in Europe".
On the one hand, it's very large - it's been running the largest assets in the world - and on the other it's not going out of scandals for years.
It's said that the proud Swiss bank won't lose anything.
It all started during the financial crisis.
By 2007, BBB had a wonderful reputation.
The Bank has combined the image of a secret and sustainable but at the same time a hunting manager with ambitious objectives and a desire to become the biggest player in the investment bank.
As a result, in 2007, BBB managed 1.6 billion, thus having more money than any other bank in the world,
And as an investment bank, it went into the league of the largest banks of the world.
That's an impression.
Hans Geeger, former banker and professor of bank affairs at the Institute of Banking of the University of Zurich, explains: "I have always introduced my students to BB as a model of a good bank."
"I know what we know now, you can ask how I could be so wrong."
He's really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that there was something wrong with BB.
In the middle of the year, the executive director of Peter Wuffley, who was considered an intellectual and at the same time a banker, unexpectedly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to figure out why he left.
The Bank's investment unit was trying to play under-standard securities and had to record billions.
Believe me, you don't want to, but BB reported an increase in capital of 13 billion Swiss francs to counter the crisis.
The Bank has really managed to find investors - but investors whose services many banks would have recently been reluctantly rejected - one very rare Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund, which is so hidden that its name has not even been reported.
It was just the first hit.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The Bank had to report new billions of losses, and the President of the Board of Directors, Marcel Ospel, a second-rate payout president of the Board of Directors in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, an accident occurred, and the State had to save it because of the lack of investment in the financial crisis.
The National Bank has purchased U.S. toxic-value books for an uncalled billions, and the Swiss Confederation has paid six billion Swiss francs for the conversion obligation to become the owner of the bank.
All Switzerland was shocked: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of large banks in the small country.
Finally, the resulting balance of BB in 2007 was five times the total production of Switzerland (see chart).
"We can't save BB in the second time," says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first.
Several months later, BB capitalized in a tax dispute with the United States and stated that it was ready to transmit data to stately clients who might have been taxed by the bank.
BB also agreed to pay $780 million from the reimbursement of unreasonably income from business plus tax.
BB thus acknowledged that it was an instrument for the removal of taxes.
At the same time, BB has lost what has always been his advantage in the fight against rich clients, a mystery.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the President of the Board of Directors subsequently withdrew, and
The client's money is starting.
Within a few months, the bank lost confidence in both the main areas of its activities, in investment due to miscellaneous speculation and in asset management, as a result of aid and tax recovery.
And it just calmed down and it was said that BB was able to overcome the situation like this accident with the afferist-treader. One contractor dropped 1.7 billion euros before they noticed something wrong in the bank.
It is clear that risk management in the investment department is not working.
"The incident with Adobe clearly showed that risk control was insufficient," said Martin Jansson, professor of economics and finances at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks is also convinced: "The problem of BB is that he does not have a risk control tool".
That is, the long-term vigilance of Swiss bankers from the food of the world's largest assets is not an extreme risk, but security for money, regardless of whether the world has collapsed outside the Albanian Republic or not.
The Swiss banks' safes have become a symbol of unwavering confidence, as Lindt and Spr√ºngli symbolize the frozen taste in chocolate.
The BB's apartment in Zurich is still in line with the shape of a worthy Swiss private bank, just a little more.
It's just a classic.
The bank's main office is in Zurich, Banchofstrasse, which leads from the main line to the Zurich Lake, in the vicinity of the Swiss snowcapped peaks.
Buildings here are growing and rental rates for shops are one of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss shops of the Conferie Spr√ºngli type can be found here in jewellery companies such as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been available here for hundreds of years - from the National Bank to the Creedy Swiss Court and elite private banks, such as Julius Ber.
The heavy door leads to the B.B.E.
The walls are covered with large red diamonds, and with the symbol bank, the "Sief" is a large indicator.
BB knows he needs his clients, trust.
But both the largest Swiss banks, BB and Credit Suisse, have at some point rejected Swiss banking concepts -- or, as one of the few Swiss banks thinks, betrayed them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the newspaper, like all Swiss banks, and he's working with two major banks.
He believes that BB has become too large, especially in an investment bank where the English are very active.
He thinks the Swiss have something to add here.
"And if there's anything, they've been adapted to the Anglo-Saxon customs for a long time."
Indeed, the Anglo-Saxon Investment Bank has changed the UK, brought its first large profits - and then Fisco -- and no other financial institution in Europe has lost as much money as the Swiss Bank has lost in its branches of substandard assets.
Catastrophe became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"In the middle of this small country's coalition with the population of seven million people has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of the country," writes Lucas Hessig in his book Crahb.
Policies approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save a bank from bankruptcy.
How could it have happened?
If you ask Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly BB.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks joined one major group in June 1998.
A bank was established, which was already too large for Switzerland, and a bank that continued to grow.
This also helped to complement the two banks that formed BB; one was a rich but moderate bank that specialized in asset management in Zurich; the other was not such a rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment banks have gained access to a large amount of money they could use to run the most powerful race.
Two names are related to the growth of BB: Peter Wolffley, Executive Director of the BB Group from 2001 to 2007 and Marcel Ospel, President of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolfley and Ospel were a dream team," says bank analyst Hans Geeger.
"Wulffley, an intellectual, humble and deeply understanding model and statistics, and Ospel with his internal instinct, passed all the way up from the stage in the bank."
But Ospel finally stood on Wolffly.
And Wolffley could make a critical mistake. "He decided his models were real," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride goes on to defeat.
The BBs will well remember the meetings of the members of the government at which Wolffly has always repeated one and the same slogan - to appeal to Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he was the head of the tournament table, where bank success was achieved.
BB wanted to go to the top of this table.
He was able to make part of this way.
BB was the biggest game in the trade of currency and public securities.
The competent management consultants, however, pointed to a weak place, which in banking terminology was called "permanent income", which was far behind the largest banks.
The U.S. mortgages were broken.
To close the door, BB joined an adventure that was not easy for him to live.
As they grew up, their own bank and the Hedge Fund invested in US substandard securities.
This was developed in a large mechanism that combined the valuable books based on American mortgage loans and sold them further and continued to bear the risks themselves.
Even when other banks have long sought a way out of this process, BB has not stayed.
"UBS bought a lot by the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was already in fire," says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the decline.
One manager had to consider how the bank‚Äôs attempts were more difficult than they had been at the beginning.
Posts in the U.S. had become children's games with chairs and are still hopeless.
Anyone who is head of this huge bank is almost impossible.
It must find a strategy for a bank that has returned back to all existing business models.
The Irish bank analysis already has the idea of withdrawing from the investment bank, focusing on asset management and forgetting about its Swiss roots.
Bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
However, it is evident that investment activities need to be seriously feared.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present its future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Swiss banker was considered in fact only as a temporary decision when the bank unexpectedly broke up with its predecessor, Grubel.
In the past, he has been able to show the character and now, as the Zurich Bank stated on Tuesday, he is headed by the BB on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to the state in which it was in the mid-1990s.
It reduces 3500 jobs.
But that's not gonna be enough.
We need a development concept.
What's BB?
How does he plan to earn money?
These questions are asked by the creditor by Axel Weber.
In public, he just said that he and his wife were looking for a place in Zurich.
Next year.
The threats of recession in Europe are under the U.S. Fund Office
The rising recession in Europe has worsened the formation of American investors at the beginning of the week.
The exchange of Governments in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has undermined the hope that the long-term crisis could be overcome by birth.
The general relief that followed the changes of Governments in Rome and Athens was not supported.
The euro fell to the dollar.
Last week the Italian and Greek stocks were still considered to be half full and not half empty - but now the problems are going back to the first level, Mark Lucini from Janney Mongomery Scott said.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were included in sales lists.
The Down Jones industrial index closed at 12.078 per cent with a drop of 0.6 per cent.
The market barometer during trade ranged between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
A larger S&P 500 index was closed at level 1251 and dropped by one per cent.
The Nasdaq technological index has lost 0.8 per cent and is marketed at 2657.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell by 1.2 per cent and closed at 5985 points.
The industry in 17 countries has significantly reduced production and is adapted to the end of growth.
The Eurostat Statistics Service reported that in September companies produced two per cent less than in the previous month.
This message put American investors in a cupcake. "We're not on the island, we're dependent on them," said Steve Goldman from Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe would rather quickly survive the recession and that banks would show further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffet has only been able to confirm these fears, and in the CNC interview he said that it is still uncertain whether Europe is strong enough to do everything it needs to end the crisis.
Therefore, he believes it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Baffet released a ten-year principle in a mustache and invested in an American high-tech industry.
Its investment in IBM of more than $10 billion increased during the sale of the shares of the company's older company's shares by almost 1 per cent against the trend.
The shares were closed, almost unchanged, at the level of $187.35.
Buffet stated that he paid an average of $170 for the share and now has a share of 5.5 per cent.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hatway fell by 1.3 per cent.
Bank of America's shares fell by 2.6 per cent, much stronger than the market.
The Bank has converted almost all the remaining share of the Bank of China into $6.6 billion.
The Bank is primarily planning to support its share of net income from sales in order to comply with more stringent rules.
The Boing aircraft manufacturer won, reduced the losses on Down-Jones.
The share price rose by 1.5 per cent after the firm received the largest order in its history.
In the wake of Emirates' flight, 50 remote-larger aircraft were ordered by a total of $18 billion.
Including a purchase option of another 20 aircraft, the total amount of $26 billion.
Some 710 million shares have been transferred by the owner to the New York Foundation Exchange.
719 companies have grown, 2281 have fallen and 79 remain at the same level.
The 630 companies have completed their trade in growth, 1913 fall and 82 remain at the same level as Nasdaq at the cost of 1.38 billion shares.
The Minded Wounds Fill the City
The game is considered a problem bird in many places, and experts say today that these very smart birds will no longer be able to get out of town.
Some like birds, others want to escape them as soon as possible.
The solution to the bird problem, however, has not yet been reached.
At the first symposium on vorones, experts in the city of Ler, East Frissia, claimed that the player could no longer be expelled from the city.
The experts from all Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Conservatives claimed that the root of the problem in cities had been in migration particularly protected players, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
The growing forests and the destruction of traditional trees have made life difficult for birds.
The walls are protected.
In the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the northwestern part of Judea, Dipholce, Ahime under Bremen and Lere there are large colonies with more than 600 parents.
A number of projects have been launched in L√©re to provoke inadmissive newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described the hunting of birds in hunting and killing their wings as particularly cruel.
"Common movement and intimidation don't give anything," said architect and Landshaft designer Werner Clever from Lara.
The accumulation of water or logging nets has often had adverse effects, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lara, Baden-Wurttemberg.
"The animals are scattered, and large colonies are divided and scattered across other areas."
Fear can only be eliminated by a series of hospitals, homes of the elderly and schools.
"He'll have to live with them, get rid of them, not the option."
In the absence of environmental problems in cities, Mr. Lera Wolfgang K√§llner says, there will be no solution.
The association of the flight of birds in need of protection and incentives for them to return to other areas could be an exit.
"Informatics instead of benzopile" was a slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Utt Maria Jurgens, who speaks for a completely different approach to birds. "We must be convinced to live with this problem."
The Jurgens was one of the founders of the Acherberg educational field in Schlezwig-Golstein, where information on the lives of very well-thoughted players is provided at information stations.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jurgens also expressed his opinion on complaints about noise, birdless birds. "The noise gives a lot of information, they need to tell each other a lot."
These birds have come into legends, and games often not only use tools to control their prey but also make their own tools.
Conduct researchers at Cambridge University recently protested a bird's approach to four games.
In one pilot, birds quickly realized that they had to pay for their weight in order to get the individual to pray.
Without special training, they knew the size and shape of the stone needed to cut the cargo.
The second experiment had to solve a more complex challenge.
The researchers placed a small glass of individual prayer in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get their way.
But the researchers gave them some cucumbers.
All four birds were used to make hooks and use hooks to catch the wind by hand and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four players have done so since the first attempt.
Ronald takes Portugal to Euro-2012
The hopes of Bosnians and Turks in the last minute were long gone.
In addition to Ireland, Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland took the last place in Euro-2012 workshops in Poland and Ukraine.
Under the guidance of Christian Ronaldus, who died in 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal won Bosnia and Herzegovina with account 6:2 (2:1), ideally formulated its fifth exit to Euro after 0:0 at the first stage.
Cheham was sufficient 1:0 (0:0) in the second round played off against the Black Rider after the clean victory in the first round (2:0).

Nani (24 minutes), Nelder Po≈°tiga (72 and 82 years) and Miguel Veloz (80th) killed the rest of Portugal.

Sen Lulic got a second wish card at 54 minutes.
Portugal has already won Bosnia from the 2010 Peace Championship in South Africa.
Portugal has made a great start at the Lisbon Stadium da Lus.
Ronald took an early start, carrying a free shot at the door about 30 feet [30 m].
Four hours later, Nani demonstrated its long-lasting capabilities, with a 25-metre score of up to 2:0.
The Bosnians who did not open the account in the first half of the first half received their first opportunity thanks to the attacker Edin Jaco.
The former Wolfsburg game of the leader of the English Championship Manchester City at the 33rd minute sent the sword head to the lower end of the stage, but the sword did not cross the gate.
Irachek kills for Chechia
Then, at the center of the attention was Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding .
After an attack on Elder Po≈°tig in the Bosnian penal area at 36 minutes, Stark decided that the Portuguese game was simulated and showed him a wish card.
The Church also condemned the suspicions of hand-playing after Fabi Quentran - Misimovic had executed it.
Four more voices were heard after the 2004 European Deputy Championships were stopped.
Peter Yiracek raised all remaining doubts about the Czechs at the 81st minute.
European championships were held in 1976 for the fifth time.
Success has also been intensified by the team of trainer Michael Bilek and legionaries of the Bundesley Michael Kadlet (Bier Leverkuzen) and Thomas Peckhart (FC N√ºrnberg) after an error at the very beginning that could be disastrous.
Peter Chech's 9th-minute drive was the result of an amputated reflex that prevented potential automotive Thomas Sivoke.
The best chances were in Montenegro when there was Stephen Yovetic and Dean Damianovic on the field.
The Damyanovic hit the end of the penal scene for 40 minutes and barely killed the Chechnya Gol.
After the break, Stang saved a already used Chechnya World Cup after FC Seoul left the field at the 50th minute.
The winner was killed once in front of the final match.
Turkey at the time did not have football luck in Zagreb.
Four days after playing 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks couldn't play better than last night 0:0 in Zagreb.
Although there is no doubt now that the coach of the Gus Hiddink team will now be released on a team scale until the third place in 2002, Croatians are on the final stage of the European Championship for the fourth time.
Almost 31,000 spectators in the Maximir stadium were able to begin ideally with their eyes.
The Seldjuka Inana's next attack occurred in the seventh minute, and the attacker Kazim Kazim couldn't shoot a sword in the net.
Croatia has since been squashed and has increasingly been in control of the game.
After the break, the Croatians continued the game in a different way.
Legionaries of Bundeslie Daniel Pranich (Bawaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aintricht, Frankfurt) were in the field with Mario Mandjukiche from the Wolfsburg team, who took place in Ivan Per≈°ic from Dortmund at 62 minutes.
Trapattonian belonged to Euro-2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first trip to Euro after Germany in 1988.
Commander Jovanni Trapattoni, who has already looked confident in his place after winning 4:0 in the first phase, took the lead for the 32nd minute thanks to the blind Steven Ward.
Constantine Vasiliev from the guest team compared the account to 57 minutes.
Ireland took a good start, but only at 23 minutes did Lord Kin from Los Angeles make the first major hit
At the last moment, the Estonian protector was reluctant to allow him to take Ireland forward.
Gol was killed at 32 minutes.
For the protection of the Greater Paul, London, the Word appeared in the necessary place and, leaving a sword through the line, changed the account to 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of workers in China
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double the number of staff in China in the next few years.

Mass killings - human measurement
The hard and very good new book Peter England: Beauty and Treasure: The Personal History of World War I begins with a long list of those who are at heart.
Here is your advice on how to read: Be careful about this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will meet these people very close to Mr. England, and this list of people active will be your GPS, your mother, at the moment when, of course, one of these men and women, you will sit on the road and lose your battle.
Mr. Englond is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which judges the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book he wrote right now, is unusual, he describes it, just like "anti-historic work".
It has a few well-known names, important treaties or so-called battles; there are almost no trades, hunting journalists or debate on tactics and combat techniques.
It's not just a book about what it was, it explains how "a book about what it looked like," it's about "the feelings, the impressions, the experiences and the state of the spirit."
The book Beauty and Scorpion has combined the experiences of 20 years of war men and women, both sides of the front line, from schoolchildren and botanists to alpineists, doctors, leaders of emergency assistance and staff.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone who falls into a pool, loses his hand or foot, comes with a mind or dies.
They live here as church saints: new ones are added to many others, and some are burned at that time.
Mr. England's book is a reference to the standard of historical books.
This is an amendment to the assumption that World War I was only a heavy war on the Western front.
The "Crassus and Scorpion" has been able to give the panorama of other military theatres: Alp, Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
In this book there are green olives; one of them meets birth in Egypt under pyramids; the problem that is not solved is the molluscs.
It's a fascinating book, almost from the very beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people like natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, which has caused untold suffering.
When you're not far from the cannon, and you're a woman and you're home with the kids, will you stay in a place or run away?
Yeah, or who's this?
Almost no one understands what is going on and why we have to fight in this war.
"The lack of facts," noted Mr. Englond, "is filled with ideas, assumptions, hopes, fears, binding ideas, theories of speech, dreams, nightmares and listening."
The beauty and treasure follow the fate of such people as Florence Farmboro, the English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young seaman of the German fleet of open sea.
Their stories are taken mainly from memoranda, letters and other published material.
The stories of their lives may be frightening or captivating, but they are at the highest level alive thanks to the small moments and details collected by Mr. Englund.
And many of them are in error and distress.
Telling the story of a German school, he says, "Ersac, let's go."
"A replacement coffee, a separate aluminium, a non-recorded rice, bungalows, wooded potatoes."
He's still talking about a chicken weasel in Germany.
He describes ‚Äúthe flesh of the pressed rice made of fat (and the fragrantly bone made of wood); the tobacco made of dried roots and dried potatoes; the bark, struck by a tree‚Äù.
He noted that there were ‚Äú837 registered meat substitutes authorised for the production of beer, 511 registered coffee substitutes‚Äù.
Some stories are about honor and respect.
One American states: "You feel that, at the end of the war, men were created to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskeys, evening newspapers or bestsellers and to claim that this show and there's civilisation and under your armchair with orders is not hidden."
The British soldier, on the other hand, notes that he will soon die and no one will notice or be angry.
"When a person is calmed down with the idea of self-sustainment, he would like to think it will happen before the public," he writes.
But it's the opposite, it's awfully like a "man who's been secretly engaged."
Other comments are about old Europe, which is emerging and new forms of fear.
"The conflict has become more and more economical," says Mr. Englond, "war agencies."
He notes the arrival of what he calls ‚Äúa new species in the well-being of the beginning of the century: a beautiful and Ideologically convinced mass killer in a well-dressed suit, which removes a sharp, desk sitter. ‚Äù
People act in a way that is unpredictable: low performances are as much like heroin.
Mr. Englond told of soldiers who were all trying to escape from prostitution a vengeful disease in order to avoid service on the front.
"The very grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of a gonorrhea, which soldiers bought and hired by the genitals in hopes of entering the hospital," he writes.
"His eyes were filled with despair, which often led to blindness."
The translation with Swedish Peter Gravez of Mr. England was a soft but non-brooding, perfectly suited for his humanitarian mission.
In the 10 smaller stages, it shows how the war has ‚Äúreleased the totally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred‚Äù.
People start asking why their leaders stop fighting.
The best books on World War I were often incorrect, such as "The Great War and the Modern Memory" of Paul Fasselle or novels such as "In the West Front without Change" by Ericha-Marie Remark, not by exaggerating historical work.
Mr. Englanda's book is part of this unskilled pantheon.
His book has the most fascinating final I can remember in the innocent literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But that's what he came from the book to the page with a list of people, took it out of your hand, and put it on his back.
After the previous error, a well-calculated row
Hundreds of police officers were employed in the operations, some in protective helmets.
The evenings from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because there was to be fewer people in the Zukotti park at the time.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few senior officers, who at first said that they were going to school.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre of events, and his presence emphasized the importance of the Department of Police operations.
There could be no mention of repeated episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of list gas against protesters, which was contrary to the rules of the Department and caused a hurricane of public sympathy to the occupyants.
So two weeks after planning and training, a police release operation was launched from the protesting Zukotti Park.
The authorities were prepared to observe the development of occupations in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis studies were conducted on Randels Island, taking account of Zukotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called anti-terrorist trainings in South Manhattan.
The last training was held on Monday at the East River side of Manhattan.
The order to go to the park came in "the last minute" - a source known as the orders in which the task was referred only to as "training".
"The few bastards I know and the people I've been leading this case didn't say they're heading to Zukotti Park," said the man who spoke about the anonymity.
"The only ones who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were at the highest posts in the department."
One of the reasons for the secret was the teaching that accepted the city.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clean the park, but they left before the hundreds of protesters who had been inside before the deadline had heard of these plans.
On Tuesday, police officers from various police units participated in operations, including forces from the districts, which were normally used to control criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost at work, were coming and leaving the park during the day, doing 1 hour of the night for the right time to arrive.
"It was right to do this when there were fewer people in the park," he said.
The rescue service machines with projectors and speakers were gathered at the Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, around the Manhattan Bridge before moving forward.
The projector and earlier written statements from the speakers seem to have solved many of the protests.
When officials of the administrative units entered the park in their heavy windshields, many protesters simply collected their belongings and left.
The police reported that the palaces did not arrive until 1:45 p.m., giving protesting time to collect things.
Other police groups, on witness evidence, were gathered on the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park kept going.
Paul J. Brown, the head of the Department of Police, said that this was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they did not let them see how the police were working and that the police treated them badly.
Mr. Brown said that the camera cars on the Cherch Street, along the west border of the park, could take a picture.
When the police passed west through the chest of personal protestants, including bags, plastic bags and polyethylene bags, full clothes, the Sanitary Department's team went after her, collecting what had been broken.
Some of the protesters who refused to leave were shocked, and photographs of it appeared on the Internet soon.
The main group of protesters took positions from the kitchen camp at the center of the park.
Some set up barracks, and the police went inside, systematically arresting them.
About 10 people in the camp center dug their hands together.
And two men stuck themselves in the woods, Mr. Kelly said.
To meet the closures, rescue personnel were called.
No arrests in the park were held until 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The cleaning operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police reported.
Mr. Brown said that about 142 people had been arrested in the park.
Most of them were arrested for "infraction of public order and opposition to detention," he said.
The highest office in the area was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the German police department, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, although he was present, "He didn't lead the operation," said Mr. Brown.
The second group of police were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
The buildings were placed in Cortland Street, in the north quarter of the park, and in the Pine Street district, in the south.
Observers saw how the police had expanded the perimeter even further beyond the borders of Zukotti Park.
At one point, observers saw as a group of police, many with shields, were exaggerating the people further.
About 28 people were on the north perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
About 5 a.m. from Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped onto a police car and the other, according to the observers, flew out of the police force.
At some point from the crowd, you've been flying a bunch of fans.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
Professional union of service staff of the City ' s Deployment Court
The trade union, representing hundreds of school staff who lost their places in the past month, plans to bring them to the city court in the middle, claiming that the exemptions were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students were taught.
The court proceedings are likely the latest available means of disengagement by the District Council 37.
Sixty-sixty-two school assistants, co-ordinator of work with parents and other workers who were among the lowest paid workers in the city lost their seats on 7 October because the leaders of the trade union called for a political response to their refusal to give the city access to the medical funds managed by the working groups to close the door to the previous public budget.
City officials categorically rejected this charge.
At the hearings of the City Council last month, the School Chancellor Dennis M. Walt said the release was part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the members of the Board complained to him that there was no indication in the budget that the school support staff would be released.
The representatives of the 37 District Council reported that they had been informed by the Department of Education that they had been requested; a press conference would be held in the middle to announce the formal submission of the request to the Supreme Court of the State of Manhattan.
Mr. Walkert and the Department of City Education will be identified as the respondents and are listed as eight temporary fired workers, all black or Latin American women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, representative of the City's Legal Department, said that the city had not seen a search and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to the preliminary version of the New York Times complaint, the trade union focused on a number of dropouts in schools in poor urban areas in order to support the claim for unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools lost more assistants because they were temporarily not funded.
He indicated that while there were no exemptions in Staten Ireland, 17 school support staff in the Upper East Sea or Tribe schools had lost their places in 23 districts in Brunsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had arrived in the Districts 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants working in 36 Free Secondary Schools in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the report states: ‚ÄúThese are not areas of stable parents who can find money to fill the gap in the budget.‚Äù
P.S. 36 budgets were focused on 3.26 per cent this year, and she also lost money when the city changed the rate of additional funding for each poor student attending school.
The trade union also claims that the school director could have been misled by the language of the notification allowing the parents to be fired.
The word ‚Äútravel‚Äù was used in the notification, although the word ‚Äútravel‚Äù was often used when the school teacher was transferred to the list of available staff paid by the central office.
"Six hundred and six co-ordinators on parental work have been fired," says the blackout, "and not just translated."
Mission completed, Congress ready to agree on Libya
It is said that the Republicans and Democrats at the Capitol Valley are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the return to Libya.
All that was needed was to win the fight, former dictator Muamar Kaddafi was taken and killed, and the American intervention was over.
On Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs should consider the resolution issued by President John Kerry (Democratic, Massachusetts) along with Senators John Mackein (Republic, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (independence, Konnektikut), who commends the Libyans for their success and the American army for "failure".
"The resolution meant to honor the people of Libya when they started rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"This is a confirmation of support for their democratic opposition by both parties."
The language may seem harmless, but no further discussion of Libya has been easy.
This year, the lawmakers from both parties argued with each other and with the White House on the formulation of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the American army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution that allowed the limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of both parties and did not vote in the Senate.
But on the same day when the bill was passed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would reduce the financing of the American operation in Libya.
This left an American mission in some kind of legislative cleaning -- when Congress was sufficiently exposed to criticizing Obama's approach to the mission, but not so bad that it really cut the soil off her leg.
As a result, the inconsistencies of the Congress
In August Tripoli was hit by the Libyan rebels, and on October 20, Cadafi was killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs ‚Äúis defended by the people of Libya by its incredible courage and by its inalienable persistence in the pursuit of freedom‚Äù and thanks both men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their unaccustomed courage and professionalism‚Äù.
The resolution also ‚Äúconfirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya‚Äù.
Are new measures fully supported by the Foreign Affairs Council or by legislators such as the June Bill?
In response to the last version, Senator Richard G. Luger, leader of the Republican Committee, made a statement.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not seen the last version of the bill yet.
On the other hand, the capital of the House of Representatives should be voted in favour of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the main legislative priority almost every republican and some Democrats in the Congress.
This measure, proposed by a member of the House of Representatives of Bob Gudlat (Republic, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or anything else that will be made to the plenary vote of the Congress of this Assembly.
Other legislators were unable to make their amendments to the plenary meeting, but not because they did not try.
The amendment was just one of the 68 constitutional amendments affecting a wide range of issues raised in this appeal.
Some have doubled - the same bill has been introduced into the House of Representatives and the Senate - while others have been minor variations.
There are at least 15 versions of amendments to the balanced budget only in the House of Representatives and a few more on "control over federal expenditure".
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors - mainly fresh-chosen republicans who want to improve their summary - the possibility of finding out that they have "caused" such a proposal.
The budget control act that took place in August required that the House of Representatives and the Senate vote for the amendment to the balanced budget.
In March 58, the senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the terms of office of Congress members and the members of the House of Representatives of Jos√© Serrano (Democratic, New York) want to abolish the limitation within two years of the President.
Congressman Jessie L. Jackson-Young (Democrat, Illinois) proposed many amendments guaranteeing, inter alia, the right to quality education and health.
An amendment that prohibits single marriages has been proposed for many years as well as another prohibiting flag burning.
Some legislators also wish to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are opposed by two thirds of the States.
As the members of the Congress have tried to propose amendments, they are moving not faster than they have been in recent years.
At the 111th Assembly, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments and 110 introduced 66.
This step will take place in the early 1990s when the members of the Congress, according to the Senate library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But their success was not more than it is now.
The last amendment adopted - 27 - was approved in 1992, but was introduced to Congress in 1789.
"The murder, but not escaped," said Giffords in his first television interview after the trial
Ten months after an armed man shot into it at public events in Tuson, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on the federal canal on Monday evening, supported the song from the "Sunday tomorrow" show and said that he wanted more to welcome him than to return to the Congress.
As part of the "20/20" Ebi-Si News programme with Diane Soyer, Giffords worked hard to make proposals and needed assistance in the process.
The program showed its difficult way of recovery after the trauma caused by the lung that broke the skull and broke the left side of the brain from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and voted three times on the draft Law on Limit Debt.
In his first television interview after the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13 people, Giffords collapsed, laughed and kissed - and called his health ‚Äúhard‚Äù.
About Soyer's feelings, 41-year-old Giffords said, "The eye is good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronomer Mark Kelly, was part of the time special issue "20/20", which was shown to be delayed by the release of a new book by Gabby: The History of Courage and Hope."
The specter reported on the return of Gifford after the shooting on 8 January.
On the video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she's sitting on a hospital bench with a bright head and a long scar on her lip.
She can only raise one or two fingers at her husband's request.
A few months later, we see Gifford sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
Wash your head.
Remove the tires.
And then her first word, "What."
A few days later, Giffords made the second word "toss", please change the menu tomorrow.
The video shown by Ebi-Si shows that music has played a central role in Gifford's health: we see how Congressman sings along with doctors "The Girls Just Want to Enjoy" Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" Tom Petty.
In an interview with Soyer Giffords, who spent two hours a day in the proceedings, said he would not remember the day of the trial.
Her husband told her that he had read the Giffords article in the March 12 shooting newspaper when she stopped him for the first time to ask about the six who were killed then.
The suspected attacker, J. Li Laffner, is detained in Missouri and undergoes forced treatment in waiting for the trial.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Soyer.
"Weighing, weighing, weighing."
Once in her recovery, Kelly Soyer said, "I'm out."
"And I said, ' Gabby, you're not escaped," said Kelly.
You're just killed.
And you're going through it, you're healthy, and you're going back stronger than ever.
Soldiers feel more sadness than respect
The event was a holiday at Wall Street, which collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock had a balalade about helplessness, disappointment and loss.
Several hundred soldiers, mariners, pilots, and seafarers were built around him.
The audience in the smokinga played his stand.
"The military looked like heroes," said David Salzman, who organized a campaign to collect money.
The senior military officer at the concert, which was also the Chairman of the Chiefs Committee at the time, Admired Mike Mallen, saw the role of the army as a second.
"They were treated like orphans," wrote an officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But in fact it wasn't a respect, it was a pity.
The very opposite pressures illustrate the difficult relations between the army and often the same American public at times.
Soldiers are grateful for their victims.
But praise has its price, soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting in such a way that it is a source of pity to people in their form.
"We're not all victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who ordered the military in Iraq and is soon leaving Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show support is to deal with us as unhappy."
This is a sensitive subject for military officers who do not want to appear unappreciative or inconsistencies with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger experienced by the return troops in recent years in the Vietnam war has been much worse.
As a result, most of the sorrow talks are quiet and only between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from their combat activities in the seabed, Colonel Mark Kenshn warned them that non-military people would look at their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with admiration because they had been robbed of their furniture and lived in exotic places.
Others will wonder if it is not hidden under the "major evil spirits," said Kenshn, who fought in Iraq and returned to take a high government post in Washington.
While looking for work, he said he felt that some interviews had been carefully asked if he could maintain the pace of responsibility in Washington immediately after the war.
Kenshn remembers saying to his sons: "When you talk about your service, you have to consider the negative effect."
The ignorance experienced by the military is partly due to American non-warism.
Winnings in the field of war are rarely received thanks from a country that is hardly known to the army and sees little direct benefits from the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate war heroism as it was done in the second world war," said Lieutenant General David Bernau, who ordered US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, policy recovery and public awareness are mainly focused on the deep suffering of a soldier.
The troops estimate the number of steps they have taken, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of loss.
The army is facing increasing pressure from the parties to combat rape
In this week's historical hearings should be decided whether 28 men and women will take action against the army against the charge of non-violent rape.
If not, hundreds of units will be built in line with the following.
Elizabeth Lyman, 25 years old and 11 weeks of pregnancy, according to her claim, was raped by her servants at night.
This was in October 2008, she returned to her home at Miramaar Airport, north of San Diego after she had been married to another man and met a man's servant who had not packed a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could take her to the room for a drink.
"It was a beautiful flag," says Lyman.
But Tehasa's nurse has relieved her fears.
No, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I'm sorry I didn't listen to my instincts then."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, the man came back to her, fell down and raped her, she claims.
On this week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 other present and former soldiers will be forced to wait for the court's decision on a historic hearing that will take place in Arlington, Virginia and decide whether they will go to the court for a search that they have filed against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Ramfeld.
It is claimed that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to deal with widespread military violence in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The search, given in February by Lawyer Susan Berk of Washington, D.C., initially included 17 prisoners, but an increase of up to 28 over the next months was 25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or threatened by sexual violence by their employees and that the army did not properly investigate, prosecuted, or provided adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Berk says she's focused on the superiors of the army because the problem is starting with them.
"Armiya is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can eradicate the culture of violence?
Berk also said that since February there have been about 400 other victims, many of whom can participate in future demands.
Its strategy: instead of collecting all the participants in this case, the whole class of eggs in one root, so to speak, it will open up a lot of cases if it is necessary to support pressure.
The Ministry of Defence's defence team, led by Federal Prosecutor Nila McBride, took steps to stop the case.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek reveal a strategy for protection - mainly because former or current soldiers cannot claim military damages caused by the armed forces.
According to the doctrine of the Supreme Court of 1950, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by persons serving in the military.
‚ÄúThe alleged damage is related to the risk associated with the military service of the founders,‚Äù says the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially prohibited from taking part in the fight, this division exists only in terms of words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women ' s troops play an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the area of combat.
As a result, 150 women were killed during the two wars -- two thirds of them fighting.
The army is too early to become modern, says Berk.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her demand, three others are prepared.
At the Yale Legal School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against four major military teams for the promotion of the feminist atmosphere.
A separate non-commercial combination of U.S. veterans in Vietnam is preparing a search for an army at which the diagnosis of "reforms of personality" is aimed at the victims of violence in order to remove them from the service - a common phenomenon, such as Anu Bhagwati from the human rights group of the Organization of Women of the Armed Forces.
In December her group appealed against the Office of Veterans, accusing her of discriminatory practices of treating pensions from persons who claimed to have been threatened with sexual violence during the service.
Nine separate draft laws proposed by a number of measures were introduced at the Congress of the Group of Senators and members of the Chamber of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, the Department of Prevention and Combating Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Commerce reported 3,158 rape attempts.
However, it is known that attacks are often not reported, and the figures are estimated to be about 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred in the year.
The report, published in March, also examines the percentage of cases: in 2010 20 per cent of known cases were brought before the court, twice as much as in the civil justice system.
In fact, Burke calls them the first in a number of other traumas.
In the case of Lyman, she stated that she had been raped by the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell her details of rape 11 times by police, doctors and commanders.
She collected all the evidence of rape, and the blood of the attacker was found on her chest.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat in front of the judge at the hearing she was asked if she had been having sex with another person on the day of the attack.
Six persons gave a positive character to the accused who was finally justified.
"I remember the day when Verdit was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was a rose now - I escaped from the courtroom with a cry."
"They put me in a psychiatric office, and when I got up, I remember my commander said, "It wasn't a court over him, it was a court over me."
Lyman was directed to a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a change of personality that made her uncomfortable.
In January 2010, she was released with a negative statement that did not allow her to receive any benefits.
Whether the case has been brought forward by Lyman and her fellow students is a complex issue, says John Terley, professor of law at the University of Law, George Washington.
But he says, "I think they will be able to move forward."
Between them and verdigo is a doctrine that has been criticised since it appeared.
I've been critical of Doctrine Ferres all my life.
The army has remained behind for decades because it does not have the incentives and restraints that impose responsibility.
He adds, "The chances are great against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when the right people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their interest, Berk, a lawyer of lawyers, will collect hundreds of other candidates for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform," she says.
Or until we die, depending on what happens earlier.
There's an eye on the wall: How the researchers study you at Facebook
Before becoming a new person of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Bravik was an ordinary guy who expressed his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
The first open hearing was held on Monday, Bravik, which met with a mass murder in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed.
Although Bravik was able to operate alone, he was not far away from the network: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, with millions of nationalists who support right groups in social networks.
After the summer tragedy, the researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how can I find them?
It's easy. You just need to get to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not easy to approach him," said Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent European cyber populism report by the British Research Centre DEMOS.
The Facebook database is so large, Bartlett says that researchers could easily use the website's advertising tool to identify the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy - marketing and doing it for several years.
The Bartletta command discovered a million fans of right groups throughout Europe and then moved them to ad, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, it offered users an examination of their education levels, violence and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 10,000 participants were able to interview 14 extreme-right parties in 11 European countries - not even leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way of doing research," says Bartlett.
Some results are not so obvious: online right-wing groups are mostly young men who are under-immigrant.
But it is unexpected that "those who combine their online activity with off-line activity are smarter, more democratic and less aggressive than those who just walk away from the monitor."
DEMOS is just one example of Facebook becoming a new popular instrument in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and politicians use the site to study everything in the world - from health to social trends expressed in Lakes, wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three entries per day, the Facebook ‚Äúsuper-current information‚Äù is calling for a research boom, increasing the number of research articles entitled the site by 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook has been able to study people who are unable to get to the street with a block.
"In the past, if you wanted to ask people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You should go into the party and they would never accept you," says Bartlett.
"The Facebook excludes all of this - you're going straight to it."
Others say that this website could identify and study social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleague showed that students who discussed their drinking movements in Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that students who attend, for example, their social teachers could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who is too often to update drinking status.
"You can't solve the problem without finding it," said the Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author Moreno and the director of the Children's Health, Behavior and Development Centre at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We have found a way to identify children from a risk group who would otherwise not have found out."
Facebook also regularly draws information about its users.
The website processing group has reviewed the status statistics of Saint Valentine's Day, as well as the National Index of Happiness (mainly using information available only to them, the cyber-liberal campaigns have long insisted that the site should make its comprehensive collection of data available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site looks after them, they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play in Scrabble with another person in thousands of miles of you, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become involved in research that they don‚Äôt even know about?
While the researchers have strict rules for offline research, online data are generally available.
"I don't think that many users would have thought that the researcher could observe their profiles," says Neil Selvin, a sociologist from the London Sciences Laboratory, about a study he conducted in 2006 using the general study pages of students in Facebook.
"As long as they represented themselves, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
There is no guarantee even that the research facility is very fair.
On Facebook it is impossible to determine the amount of information in the profile and on the user's page.
"What you're talking about on Facebook, and what you're doing outside Facebook, are two absolutely different things," says Selvin.
That is why, despite his years of work in the field of technological research, Selvin believes that blockade and handcuff are still the best research tools available.
"Nothing can replace real peace and real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be social, and most of society is still online."
" Cold and inhuman": Anders Bering Bravik, the first public audience to appear before the court
Anders Bering Bravik, a man who met in the organization of a double attack that took 77 lives in Norway this year, described himself as a fighter "opposite" during the first public appearance in the Oslo court.
‚ÄúI am a Norwegian military commander of the resistance movement and the Norwegian Ricaire Tamplier of Norway‚Äù, he brought before 500 in court.
"I hate the court because you got your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I admit my actions, but I don't admit my sins."
Judge Torkiel Nesheim interrupted Bravic during this monology because he "did not want to give Bravic the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views".
For the same reason, he refused to allow Bravic, who had taken the earlier written statement, to call the victims‚Äô relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nasheim also ordered the police to keep Bravik under detention for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and records for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives visited the victim.
Some came up hoping to see Bravic in the eye, others to make sure he was locked up.
All came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," told the Norwegian NRK channel one of Utah's survivors.
"It was uncomfortable, but personally it was a little easier for me after I saw and heard the suspect."
The wearer in dark costumes and blues of the Braveik Galaxies maintained peace and professionalism throughout his entire hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors when he entered and left the building.
Despite the strange idea that he was part of a major ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù movement, the judge decided that he was not a suspect, and said that there was no evidence of what he had been doing with the communiqu√©.
Some may be relieved by the fact that the attacks on 22 July are said to be the work of one extremist, not radical groups.
But this does not automatically reduce the mountain and the feeling that is now felt by all nations.
"I'd like him to look like a monster, but it's not like that," said one victim's relative.
"It would be much easier if it were."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview that was shown in the theater this week
After Steve Jobs' death on 5 October, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing a technical genius as the Great Modern Manufacturer.
But what Apple fans can think of as the greatest openness in a recently discovered interview they had mentioned in the pre-markets show this week is how much this creative mind was understood in business processes and manufacturing technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer and considered himself a hippie, but he was also a suitable organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business leaders had suffered from ‚Äúsickness to think that a really big 90 per cent idea of work... [but] a big idea from a large product separates a huge amount of work.
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created a TV series of Triumf nerves on the display of a personal computer, and he spent more time with Jobs for a unique long term speech.
By that time, about 10 years had passed since Jobs was released from Apple, and he had been working at his new computer company NeXT in anticipation of a massive Internet discovery.
While most of Kringley's interview was used in Nerdah, he said that the original interview had been lost during transport.
Only after the death of Jobs was a full VHS copy found in the director's garage.
This removed material, slightly edited, became the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The lost interview that takes place in the Landmark Theatres on this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man who knows his hatred for a detailed interview, Jobs seems to be extremely prepared here to express his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly smart.
In four different moments, there is a large gap between questions and answers - thinking for 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly raises his thoughts to say more precisely.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism goes to the surface where he seems to be confused with Kringley's issues that make him move faster on issues or events of greater importance.
In the evening before the age of Pixar, iipods and ephones The Poterian interview is something worse when Jobs appreciates what he sees different companies do right and wrong and offers his own vision of future information technologies.
One thing is to read about the death estimates of Jobs' work, but there's something vulnerable and inspiring in Jobs that we've seen here, anxiously dreamed of at a small size.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
Small summary of seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to manage his business:
"For the whole time I've been in business, I've always asked, "Why are you doing this?" And the answers you get are always, "Oh, that's just doing that."
No one knows why they're doing what they're doing, nobody thinks it's too deep in business.
That's what I knew.
Jobs continues to describe his efforts to rationalize the report in Apple.
Disturbed by the cost record, which often started with the "standard costs" that were taken from the basement and then raised with the "extreme" aid, he created an automated structure that guaranteed that they would be able to track business costs down to the milk.
About Pope:
Jobs tells in detail about "the blue box," which he acquired with Steve the driver, a device that enabled people to break up the telephone company effectively and call on large distances free of charge.
The device was written a lot earlier, but Ioforia Jobs is here describing the son of the box as an act of authority.
He explains how he and his driver tested the box using the phone, ordering the conversation and then joining one AT&T network until they connected as many stations as possible.
"We've covered the ground floor once and you've called on the phone, and it's been minutes later on the next cell phone," said Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we've done is we could figure out something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both knew a little bit, but we could figure out a little thing that could control a big thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think it could ever happen without it.
Jobs goes on to describe in detail one of the most famous departures he and Voznak have had to make, calling in the Vatican through a son's box at night and asking for the Pope's phone, and all the forces are trying to copy Henry Kissinger.
When several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to an American diplomat, they were laughing right before the Pope himself was up to answer the phone.
On love of technology (and the cold name of Bill Hullette):
When he was 12 years old, he found Bill Hullett in a phone call and called him when he was about 12 years old.
Shortly after their 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs received a flight assignment to Hullett Pacard.
"It had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it shaped my view of how such a company is and how well they treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP staff visiting the research labs of Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer".
He was the size of a shirt, he had a small monitor with an electronic handbag, and I fell in love with him.
I used to sit in the HP youth room and run around that car and write for it.
On improvised innovation:
In a number of places, Jobs interview talks about the production of new products on the flight.
On the contrary, when he was going to sell a lot of cash, one buyer asked him to collect his entire computer.
Working for 30 days in credit, he had to consider the collection and the delivery of ready equipment.
Later on in Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the terrible disputes... they called me that it would take me five years [to collect meat worth $300], and I was sitting on my throat, and I went up and found a designer."
Nineteen days ago, we had a mouse that we could collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
About major energy-intensive companies:
Long before he led Apple's return, Jobs had accurately predicted how many industry leaders would see the situation and lose control of their market share.
"Let's see, you're working in IBM or Xerox, so you're doing the best copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company won't be more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, thus [that are] the types of people who come to the management of companies and the people who make the product are relieved of the decision-making areas.
The genes of the product that led to this monopolistic position were impressed by people who had no idea of the difference between good and bad products -- the required skills.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could capture the entire information technology industry.
He could be ten times more, he could be a 90-x microsoft...
They've won a victory.
On innovation as an art form:
"The big idea of a big product separates a huge amount of artificial work... when you twist a big idea, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about her thinties.
There are compromises that you need to go to -- some things you can't stop doing electronics, glass, jobs or businesses.
You need to keep in mind 5,000 ideas -- these concepts, combining them together...
In the end, it's all about taste. It's all about trying to express themselves better than people ever did, and then I'm trying to get it into what you're doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists burn.
We've always been ashamed to get big ideas.
Part of what Makintosh did was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, and historians who had become the best information technology specialists in the world.
If there were no information technologies, they would have done things in other areas.
Scully and Thomas are eating with the opposite sex before the court examines the case
On the day when the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the political issue, would he listen to the rejection of President Obama's health law, his two judges, Antonina Skalia and Clarence Thomas, and read out a meal from a respected legal firm that would dispute the case before the Supreme Court?
This happened last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the application.
One of the agenda cases was the application by 26 States to challenge the intensive health review adopted by the Congress last year by a law that united conservative activists of all nations.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, the rounds are expected for 5 1/2 hours in March 2012, and the outcome will soon become a compromise in the presidential run, which will be at the highest level until the court ruling is announced.
A lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the health law should be repealed will, in most cases, be Paul Clement, who was the deputy prosecutor-general during the presidency of George U. Bush.
The Clementa legal firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two companies that helped sponsor the annual meal of the Federation of Federalists, a long-standing group that consistently upheld conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored lunch was one of the trade associations that violated the law of the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflitzer Inc, who has a huge financial interest in the source of the stress.
A few hours after the trial, lunch was held in Washington, D.C., in the hotel.
He attended, among other things, Mitch MacConnell, the leader of the Republican People's Republic of the Senate and a well-known opposition to the Health Act.
Starting guests for dinner?
Nothing new: two judges have been visiting the activities of the Federalist Community for many years.
And that doesn't conflict with ethical standards at all.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they did, they might fall under the Code 4C, which states: ‚ÄúThe judge may visit the charity activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, a guest or a person mentioned in the programme of such activities‚Äù.
Nevertheless, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, as well as to companies with large financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the Government.
"It is a shocking violation of ethics and non-existence of the code that contradicts the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the General Affairs.
"The judges have been drunk and spent on the official money-gathering action with the lawyers who are currently in court."
Their appearance and contribution to the collection of money for this event undermines all non-existence declarations and is unacceptable.
Skalia and Thomas are quick to pay attention to critics who say they are very eager to mix court cases with groups of federalists.
And Thomas's wife, Jenny, is a well-known conservative activist.
Furthermore, conservatives claim that this is an ethical issue for Judge Elena Kagan, not for Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in the administration of Obama when the first court charges against the law were filed at the level of the first order.
Her criticisms demanded that Kagan refuse to listen to the case because she was too involved in the protection of the law at that time so that she could be impartial now.
Kagan never showed that she was going to do that.
Boeing receives a record of 18 billion aircraft orders
Emirates Air Company ordered 50 multi-fuseliner Boeing 777 and perhaps 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, an amount of over $1 billion.
This is simply news that the company receives orders for 50 units of its production.
But this is an important event when this company is an aircraft builder Boeing Co., and the oversurrection price for all of these 50 aircraft is $18 billion.
So important is where Boeing received orders: the Middle East, the growing gold living order for future aircraft.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years, 2,520 aircraft will need a cost of 450 billion dollars.
Boeing announced in these exits its largest dollar equivalent order on commercial aircraft - 50 two-way Boeing 777.
An incredible order came from Emirates Airport in Dubai.
The airline also has an opportunity to buy 20 more aircraft at a total re-insurance price of $26 billion, Boeing announced at Aviashow Dubai 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, called Dreamliner, which could be significantly better fuel and comfortable for passengers.
The trans-currency price for six aircraft would amount to more than $1 billion.
"It's really good for Boeing," said analyst Morningstar Nile Diora.
"The quality of these particular buyers is quite high."
Many nearby airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they do not only have money to pay for aircraft, but also the increase in fuel prices, which normally harm airlines, as one of the most expensive items is not so costly because the country earns money at high oil prices.
This is important, just as they are less likely than other airlines to cancel the order of aircraft when prices are increasing, Diora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates Order strengthens Boeing's leadership on the market of broadband aircraft and helps prevent the attempts of Airbus SAS's opponent to reach his home with his A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory on the plane took place four months after Airbus stated that it would delay the debate of the largest A350, which contradicted 777-300ER.
It postponed the debate in order to increase the load after buyers needed to increase the speed and distance of the flight.
Boeing Co shares grew by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
Mexico's President's sister apparently won the election in Michowana
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers assisted Fausto Valeho's opposition from IRP in the pre-election race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister apparently did not apply for Governor Michowana during the harsh state elections, and she said on Monday that drug dealers had helped eliminate the gang for one of her opponents.
As a preliminary result, Fausto Valeho is a leader in the Western State Governor's run, or IRP.
"The involvement of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and particularly yesterday, causes concern not only for Michowana but also for the whole country," said Louise Maria Calderon in a radio interview the next day after the vote.
"They scared our candidates, our electoral staff... they caught up with the polls, put an end to the arrests... and forced people to vote" for the IRP.
IRP managed Mexico for seven decades until the presidency was lost in 2000.
It is preparing a return and victory in Michowana is an important step in this attempt.
IPR hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Valeho, it seems that only a little bit of Calderon was in charge of the rating until the election day.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or PND led by her brother, refused to acknowledge Valeho as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the Left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DPRK, which is now a governorate, has come to the third -- a serious defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left in front of the presidential elections in 2012.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Valeho, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, refused to contact drug dealers and called on other candidates to acknowledge the results.
In Micah there were drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines for a long time.
This was the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoc√°n to launch a military operation against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence continues to exist.
A U.N. had been killed every week before the elections when he aggrieved Louis Maria Calderon, and several candidates left the local pre-election run because of fear.
For IRP, however, no matter how terrible the elections in Michowana might seem, the victory will be a driving force of the party.
The man who was to represent IRP in the presidential race, Henrik Penna Nate, speaking from Washington, welcomed Valeho and said, "I think this victory should be very exciting in front of next year."
ABR convinces Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank committed India and China to be ready to help save the euro area from the European debt crisis to avoid the long-term decline that would stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ABR office in Manila, said that two of the fastest growing economies should "do all they can" to speed up the recovery of the currency block by either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe ' s "inextricably" difficulties and said that Asia ' s financial assistance on the side of European leadership and resources could help to avoid a long-term fall in the global economy.
"We all do."
"That is why anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he said in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be somehow protected, but it cannot be harmless."
"So if China and India can help, this must be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely hit by a European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's loan has grown threateningly, and both the prime minister of Italy and Greece have withdrawn.
The long-term crisis in Europe gave rise to fear that it could bring the world economy back to its recession, and called on the leading developing economies to meet together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr. Neng predicted that any Asian aid would be carried out through the IMF, but he said that bilateral cooperation, such as the purchase of the EU financial assistance fund bonds, was a means of ensuring financial stability in Europe, gave tremendous strength in the negotiations with the Asian partners in Europe.
And Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India is doing its best" to help the euro area, as its own economy is now experiencing the reduction of exports and the reduction of foreign capital.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and unstable," he said.
"We have great challenges, and we must support the high level of growth."
"It's an impossible option, it's a mandatory condition, because where we find work for tens of millions of our young people and girls."
Others argue that India ' s developing economies have no meaning in helping rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashtosh Varshni, professor at Brown University, U.S.A., said that it would be very difficult from a political point of view to provide European assistance to 1.2 billion Indians living around $800 million a day or less.
"At some point they will know that the Greeks are going to retirement for 50 years and eating on holidays to the sea, and this will not be taken well," he said.
Li Howell, Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reserves should be used to contain Greek-based and well-paid public-sector workers in poorly organized, perishable enterprises such as railways.
Mr. Ng said that the euro area crisis threatened " significant direct consequences" throughout Asia.
ABR's forecast of 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia in 2011/12 is now faced with ‚Äúdegradable risks‚Äù due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets would need to develop emergency plans in order to protect themselves from falling and significant flows of capital from their economies.
Feared warning by the Pentagon on potential reductions in defence costs
The Minister of Defence, Leon Pannett, made the situation worse by Monday at the convention, warning that the expected automatic budget reductions would undermine national security and bring about a financial tight response from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civil assembly.
The Pentagon has already been reduced by $450 billion in the coming decade, but it is now feared that additional reductions to 600 billion or more could be inevitable if the Congress could not reach a cost agreement.
"The consequences of these cuts will be devastating to the ministry," Panetta reported in a letter to the senators of the Republic of John McCain, Arizona, and to the Republic of Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of the Congress to agree on the budget and the results of the so-called section had begun a total reduction of 23 per cent and the closure of many new projects.
"This drastic reduction, which is so unwisely applied, makes most of our shipbuilding and construction projects ineffective -- you cannot buy three fourths of ships or buildings -- and will seriously damage other modernization attempts," Panet wrote to the senators.
"We also have to disarm many of our state workers and as the reduction will be done so quickly, we will have to release almost a trustee to achieve the objectives."
"These changes will undermine the trust of those who support our army and seriously damage our readiness."
The cuts in the final account are affected by military parts, Pannetta said.
‚ÄúEven though military funding in foreign emergency operations has not been directly affected by the sequencing, military achievements are seriously affected by serious budget disruptions,‚Äù Pannett warned.
"The contract staff will be reduced to terminate the contract termination and the monitoring treaty that supports the army."
"The staff will be reduced by delays in payment to military suppliers and legal and political support will be broken."
Two senators wrote the Pannett 10 days ago, requesting details of the possible consequences of automatic reductions in the Ministry of Defence.
"As a result of the Securitor of the Ministry of Defence, the United States will be rapidly falling as the world military leader."
"We are strongly opposed to these dramatic actions," the senators reported in a joint statement on Monday night when they published the letter of the Pannett.
"It's not the way we can live with, and it's not the way we should carry on."
"Secret is a threat to the interests of national security of the United States, and this cannot be done."
Whether the letter of the Pannett or the latest warnings by the senators will be delivered to the budgetary compromise or the call for the release of the Pentagon from the cuts we will see later.
The Pannetta was absolutely sincere about the possible reductions, although it had been working under the direction of the Pentagon after many years of budgetary expertise at the Congress and the White House and realized that it was facing a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence drew a unique picture of what could be followed by an army with a face but without a core.
"It's a ship without a sailor."
"It's a team without a pool."
"It's a flight flight without enough pilots."
"It is a tiger, army with barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission," Pannetta said in her opening remarks at the Pentecost.
"It is a force that suffers from an insatiable battle spirit, a bad readiness and unable to fight with potential enemies."
"In fact, it promotes aggression."
In his letters to Mackenna and Greham Pannett, he heard new details of how the reductions " generate significant operational risks: slow response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely restrict our ability to be the first to launch and react to the world; and pose an unacceptable risk to future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could be faced with obstacles, including those already tested, and some only at early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 attacker, a new bomber, a ballistic submarine ship of a new generation, a new coastal zone battleship and a new ground-based vehicle that Army and the Navy must replace in order to replace the Hammer.
The termination of further development and testing of F35 may save $80 billion in 10 years, but its parties say that this is a vital step towards improving and countering the potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to Be a Liar
A quick look at the latest headlines shows how serious and widespread lies and lies are in everyday life.
The candidates in the presidents of the Republican Herman Cain were accused of sexual harassment by several women; each party was accused of lying to another.
The Department of the University of Pennsylvania was accused of lying, since they both hid that a football coach had raped boys.
Last week, French President Nicole Sarkozy was quoted as saying to U.S. President Barako Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Binjamin Netanyihu is a liar.
The ship destroys its career and divides the country.
Congressman Anthony Weiner and Internet-exhibitor, New York Congressman Anthony Weiner, have shown himself reluctantly, denying his findings that there has been a rapid review of the evidence.
Former candidate, President John Edwards, was charged with financial machinery during the campaign to steal foreign communications.
Again, none of those living at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who lied about his sexual relations with Monika Levinski during his second post.
The history of fraud at school and college is a regular matter.
There were cases when the teacher gave the students an answer to the tests to evaluate the results of their activities.
Teachers who have to learn the opposite are sending a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we have to deal with?
In one day, as studies show, you can sell 10 to 200 times.
Now it is expected that a significant part of this is a lie of salvation.
Another study showed that unknown people were three times as likely to be in the first 10 minutes of dating as they were.
The identification of a lie or a lie is necessary for each skill for both individual and professional purposes.
Unlike a room game, such as, say, a joke where there is a need to call "Figure!", the identification of a lie is a serious direction of knowledge based on scientific data collected in prestigious universities of comprehensive research projects, especially on psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old lying myth has been broken down.
The beds look in the eye.
They don't always stop, they call, they're dressed or they're tired.
There is no need to conclude that lies are difficult to detect and difficult to publish.
An experienced layman can benefit from the truth by observing the structure of approvals, ammonia, the structure of questions and temporary characteristics.
I have spent several years studying scientific discoveries in the wide and ever growing segment of knowledge of lies, and it is clear that identifying lies is a modern ability that is easy to learn and that helps in the direction of our complex world, especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, negotiation, negotiation or management.
Good lies are especially able to read to others by making them feel comfortable, by controlling their own emotions, and by taking an intuitive sense of what others are saying.
We know from the study that extraterrestrials do more than introverts, that men lie more about themselves than women -- about others -- usually to protect some of the feelings that married people do to their partners than to their spouses (but the lie they say is more important than anything else).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty when you are deceived.
How do you know anyone's lying?
First, look at the normal behavior of your object.
It is called ‚Äúthe definition of origin‚Äù.
This will help to ensure a starting point for further evaluation of changes.
Watch for the delay, smile, voice characteristics of your object.
It would be good for you to know if a person is constantly walking on his feet in a normal way, and then you will not make any unjust accusations when you see the walk in the middle of the meeting.
Then search for false verbatim and non-verbal groups.
Treat these groups as red flags, not as evidence of fraud.
Persecutors can focus on the upper part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can put their steps towards the door, pray to go out, change their position in a certain way or demonstrate "believing after the interview" -- that's a huge wave of relief and change of position when all complex issues are behind.
Followers often falsify the end-of-question signal so that they can easily see this after the interview.
So pay attention to the word of your object.
It is well known that Scott Peterson had failed and used the past, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, which led to her search throughout the country.
Curious people can also use distance in the words "I had no sexual relations with this woman... Miss Levinski" or to repeat the whole complex question.
The most typical verbal indicators are easy to catch.
Someone can use "qualification language" when he answers the difficult question, "Well... I'm telling the truth... how much I know... how much I know."
This gives a more emotional response than actually, and is often a red flag.
There is no magic to identify a lie, but it is possible to detect fraud by means of deception.
These skills will increase the chance of each person not to become a victim of professional and personal experiences.
The standstill plan for oil pipeline construction needs to be revised after the threat of the United States to withdraw its approval
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of planned oil pipelines from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- provoked by the anger of the trade unions, but calmed by environmental defenders -- a company that was planning to build oil pipelines, she claimed that it would be willing to review the project to resume its work on it.
TransCanada reported on Monday evening that it would pick up the planned petroleum from the environmentally sensitive Pescan Holm area in Nebraska and be assured that the project would still receive approval.
The company called for this decision at a press conference in the capital of Nebraska.
The official representative of TransCanada Alex Purbas said that the company remained confident that it would eventually receive the approval of oil pipelines, even with other routes.
This will take place following the State Department's statement last week that it will defer the draft decision at the federal level until it examines new possible routes that do not affect the area of the Pescan Holms of Nebraska and the Aquifer of Ogal, the vast underground reservoir of water.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Li Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental expertise commissioned by the State Department will be most appropriate until 2013, after the elections next year, even though the authorities rejected that policy.
Both in a written statement last week called for a decision by the State Department and expressed its support.
Oil pipelines of 1,700 miles shall extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It must transfer 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the railway stations in Texas.
To do this, he needs to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by trade unions, which are dependent on some 20,000 oil-water-related jobs.
However, the lawmakers of the Nebraski against the plan are considering a bill to speed up the move from the Pescan Valley area and Ogalala, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
A recent study by the State Department on environmental impact showed that the project would only have a limited negative impact on the environment, but the source of energy industry stated that the Department's auditor had commissioned a separate expert on the two issues of consideration.
One is whether the lobbyist, TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interests for the programme.
Secondly, it was the choice of a company that was engaged in an initial study that was not appropriate, as it had been linked to TransCanada.
At Patty LaBell's court because she had a baby who was so scared.
The New York family claims that the disco-two Patty LaBell began to be in the lobby of their home in Manhattan, threatening their little daughter to such a degree that it stopped out of fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" terrorized 18-month-old Geneva Monk so strongly that it transmitted "the change in personality, sleep disorder" and "the strong fear of unknown people," her family in the Manhattan Supreme Court said.
This happened on November 10th last year when Kevin Monk, his wife, child garden educator, Rosana, and Geneva were going on their family trip.
While Kevin Monk was hunting his car, Rosana Monk landed in the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Geneva.
Rosana Monk said she stopped at the door and put her daughter down in half a minute.
"Someone came to me back and said, "You know what your daughter does?" I said, "Yes," and I went to get her," she said.
LaBell made a statement to the pregnant woman.
"It happened aggressively: "You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I said, "I don't care what you say or think."
She came into the light and began to use the movement -- word C and word F -- on high tones...
She had a bottle of water, and she started drinking water from the bottle on me.
She said that Geneva had started a drought.
"I told this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter," said the mother.
LaBell was angry at the mother who still held Geneva and her companion had to hold her and push her in the waiting car, Rosana Monk said.
The girl cried so much that she stopped, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBelle a note with an apology, but she did not receive an answer.
Lawyers and representatives of LaBell are not responding to calls for comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage was not reported, but the family lawyer Sam Davis said that he had taken this case free of charge and that the family was planning to pay any money that would benefit children with a sick hand.
"The goal is to keep Patty LaBell responsible for his actions," said Davis.
"This behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially in relation to a child farm teacher with an 18-month-old child on his hands."
Climate problems slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario Lopes' rule in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market grew, foreign funding decreased and the economy was weakened.
The 2011 year, which will take place in the economic history of Sinaloa as related to the first year of the Government of Mario Lopes Valdes, also called the year of change that has given rise to high hopes for economic development, but in view of the adverse climate conditions of the beginning of the year, growth has not been recorded, but a reduction in the main indicators of economic development has been recorded.
The low temperatures in February not only resulted in the loss of millions for the agricultural sector but limited the growth of the public economy by reducing economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historical decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which had affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to a report on areas affected by the sea provided by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 835.582 hectares were affected by 78.03 per cent of them, while the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected.
The decline in economic activity has resulted in a steady increase of unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters the rapid increase in unemployment was fixed, from January to March 55.053 of the Sinaloa population, from 4.53 per cent of the population in the second quarter to 5.28 per cent, and from July to September, it has continued to grow to 6.19 per cent, which represents more than 74,000 people living in the Sinaloa, compared to the first half.
Reduction of liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa has been discussed over the years by many factors, for economist Jerardo Lopes Servantes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), unemployment can be explained in detail by actions taken in public policy.
"What we see now is the growth of unemployment, which is related to a number of factors, including loss of market liquidity in order to limit the resources imposed by the law adopted at the Congress to combat money-laundering, such as people who are illegally owned by dollars, not just to work with them, invest and use them in something," he said.
Immigrants
Lopes Servantes said there was still a demographic factor in unemployment growth.
"The number of people leaving the country in search of employment abroad has been limited in the United States, firstly because of the difficulties with entry, and secondly because of the difficulties they have encountered, as they have once come in, they have faced very many difficulties in finding work, so that a group of people remain and demand jobs here, in the state, as a result of increasing unemployment," he said.
Infringement of formal requirements
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa will become worse if attention is paid to a large number of violations that are prevailing in working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the state's active population is working without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and abuses, another reminder of work in the State is presented with low wages; in the State, the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesos, much lower than the country ' s average, which was 7,375 pesos by September.
Reduction of PII
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high share of unemployment in 2011, the highest direct foreign investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, was $630.697 from January to July, which showed a drop of 87.74 per cent over the same period of the year.
On its part, the Government ' s Ministry of Economic Development has established a total of 17,280,000 investment pesos during the year, which have mainly come to services companies.

On the basis of the economic decline, the Government of the State requested credit approval in July at the State Congress of 3 billion pesos, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities in order to sustain the economy at the local level with a total of 2,600 million pesos, and no debt advantage was expected in any state economy until November.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario Lopes Waldes demonstrated a lack of government capacity.
Miguel Lopes, President of the National Chamber of Industry, said that during 2011, there was no agreement between different sectors, including the Government of the state.
‚ÄúThe economic efficiency in Sinaloa this year has been really low, it is necessary to work hard to restore the positions lost this year, we must double our efforts in 2012, we have not been able to harmonize the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronous work of the new Government team, we hope that the next year will be much better.‚Äù
Deployment of the economy
Lopes Loredo said that events such as early freezing stopped the state economy this year and its efficiency and growth were limited.
‚ÄúThe low number of economies are the result of several events, including sea, one of the main effects of slowing down, which will not be fast enough to create an economic dynamic that will allow for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year, we will close it down below our expectations‚Äù, he said.
Review of the direction
Theodore Salazar Uriarte, President of the Federation of Workers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state needed to continue its most dynamic production activity.
‚ÄúIn general, we have found that we have worked on this, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that will redirect the direction and economic course of the state, to mobilize all the material and human resources available in Sinaloa,‚Äù he said.
Present-day work
President Coparmex stressed the importance of identifying a future direction in order to better focus on the efforts of the Government.
‚ÄúIn general, I would say that the Government is trying to succeed in various areas, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme,‚Äù he said.
He noted that the current administration had shown progress in its own way towards public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the Government is beginning to work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government is aware that there is much more to be done," he said.
He was sentenced to 8 kilograms of marijuana
Five years of prison and income tax in 100 days, such a sentence was brought to the city of Nawolato for the storage of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney-General reported that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valensuel Sandowal, convicted of a health offence, in this case, was imprisoned for distribution.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/68/2010/MI, Valensuela Sandowal was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during the patrol of the Cypriot Waldes Street, before post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was behind a white pickup car in which he carried a black bag in his car bag, while at a passenger seat, a small truck where soldiers discovered eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, it was transferred to the Second Regional Court and the accused continued to be held in the Centre for the Legal Consequences of Crime.
There is a need to make contributions to the work
Public work related to programmes such as the Family, the Saving of Public Space and 3x1 for migrants is at risk of being incomplete or delayed because of lack of funds, Miguel Angel Lopes Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the work programmes were still under development, they were at risk, as the Government was unable to make the appropriate contributions, which amounted to over 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding of all three programmes consisted of about 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent were required by the State and that only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for the work, so it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to put up almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they haven't given us any copies when they were supposed to be part of us since early July," he said, "to keep up, we've started work and they've gone a lot, but we need money."
He mentioned that in the past year, during the reign of Hessus Agilara Padilla, the State had not made contributions that it had to make, so that at the beginning of the administration of the municipality it had to make money to cover more than 7 million, which had not been granted in that case by the State administration.
‚ÄúThis has happened to us in the previous administration because the state has no financial capacity to participate, and programmes have continued to develop, and this year to access these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what is left of the state,‚Äù he explained.
While the State authorities had an obligation to implement these resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareala, to increase efforts so that the percentages associated with them came as soon as possible.
"They have to bring up almost 12 million, and even though it's over, they haven't given us any copies."
The Court will approve the ‚Äúdigital television transition‚Äù in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of similar signals to digital is one of the most important changes that have been achieved in the past few years.
The Supreme Court (CJ) rejected constitutional claims made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which carried the so-called ‚Äúdigital television transition‚Äù from 2021 to 2015, since there were no eight votes necessary for its cancellation.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, believed that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his authority, issued a decree detailing actions to move to digital television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate have been rejected because of the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes necessary for the court to state the constitutionality or non-institutionality of the decree and remain in force.
The draft declaration, prepared by Minister Olgo Sanchez Cordero, proposed that the decree be declared uninstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme should be governed by the law of the Cofetel Federal Telecommunications Commission, in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Horhe Mario Pardo, Margareta Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
In this argument and the Senate, and the House of Deputies, held two constitutional debates to challenge and support the decree, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions referred to in it regarding the digital transition.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the House of Deputies, not to enter into the discussion of the project, as well as under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive authority could not determine the general rules of action to which the public administration should prepare.
"I also do not believe that this would have an effect on the autonomy of the regulatory body if it had happened, and I recalled that the planning of public policy in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector has to do with the federal executive authority with a constitutional mandate, the administration of the State.
The exchange of analogue signals into digital signals, one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years, has led to better use of radio spectrum, better quality of signal and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, he said, would mean that the withdrawal of benefits from the digital transformation, which includes the fulfilment of public needs which are not only technically measured, "as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he said, "are necessary for the work of the entire system of public economic administration, including a group of authorities which the Constitution combines with the State executive authority."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed digital literacy and had done so with the assistance of the executive authority, despite the existence of specialized technical institutions.
It should therefore not be concluded that the Government, by adopting the contested decree, which in any case affects the competence of the Congress, ensures administrative compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
In Michoc√°n, they analyze the possibility of counting "vote"
According to data submitted in the GDR, the difference between the first and second places in the governorate elections is 27 per cent, even without the inclusion of 879 votes to 6,074.
The possibility of counting "vote vote" is real with regard to the election process in Michigan this year, where according to data obtained from the preliminary results of the Programme of Elections (PPP) the difference between the first and second places at the governorate elections is 27 per cent, even without the total number of 879 votes in the 6.074 protocols.
In light of this, the President of the General Council of the Institute of Elections of Michowana (IVM), Maria de Los Angeles Lianderal Saragos, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body adopted a package of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michowan did not adopt the Constitution or the Electoral Code of State or the Law on Electoral Law, as the Congress approved reforms shortly before the legal date of their entry into force of this electoral process and Governor Lionel Gidoy Rangell did not include his publication within the time limit set out in the Act in the Official Journal of the State, stating that he had certain objections.
On the same day, on 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (JJJ) adopted a decision on the constitutional claim made by the local legislative congregation and called the State ' s "inactive and illegal" vote on constitutional reform, since it did not have the right to ‚Äúlet or support them‚Äù.
In an interview on the possibility of a "vote vote" by Maria de los Anheles Lyanderal, the IVM General Council stated that by adopting the appropriate principles, it would be possible to submit partial or full votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, partial recalculation of one or more of the urns may be carried out under conditions that: the results of the protocols do not match; there is no voting protocol and document submissions in the Urn or is not available to the President; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the Protocol.
At the same time, a general change in vote in all elections can take place where there is a sign that the difference between the proposed candidate-winner of the selected elections and those who received the second place in the vote is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is an application from the representative of the party and/or coalition, which issued the second of those candidates.
A general vote is also to be taken if, at the end of the ordinary meeting, the difference between the winner and the candidate taking second place is established, with less or less than one per cent, provided that there is an application from the political party whose candidate has taken second place, where electoral urns are excluded which were taken into account in the partial recalculation.
It is noted that in this situation, there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the DPRK, only 0.16 per cent of the first and second parts of the country is not considered to be a total of 129 votes in 923.
His last will.
His dust will be dissolved in the mountains of Sapalinama, confirming the family.
The rest of the pilot, Felipe Basio Cortessa, arrived in Saltillo, his hometown at night in the resurrection; on Monday there was a briefing and a quiet meal.
According to the family, the last wish of the Colonel was to develop his dust in the mountains of Sapalinama.
After a collision with other people who had died in the disaster, the Basio Cortes family returned to the Coaouil capital on a Mexican Air Force ship, and the closest people visited the Campo Marte.
The following morning, the Colonel arrived at the time of his arrival at the village of Nazario Ortis Garcia, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he attended the exhibition of the Santillo Institute of Technology organized by his former high school and football team, a member of which was Felipe Basio during high school.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo, and if his dust was broken up in the mountains of Sapalinama, he always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Cortes Basio, the pilot's sister.
In her opinion, the Colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believes that he was on the edge of his life, "he was a successful man, an unbelieving father, a son and a loving brother to his family."
Philip Cortez Basio left the city of Saltillo to get to the Air Force College in Sapopane, Halisco.
Some didn't believe him, they said that he had his head stuck in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Horhe Alberto David Basio will remember him as a very good man, "as soon as he came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to welcome him, as when he brought Martha Saaghan to Saltillo."
Junosha recalls that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapopan for the funeral of his cousin's diplomats, so he knew that his grandfather had died because he loved the most in his life: driving a plane.
It's been operated for the last time.
Fires from weapons have emerged in the honour of Colonel Cortes Basio, Governor of Horhe Torres Lopes, people from the village and government of the state, the Mexican army from the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Medieval Technology School in Saltillo, where he was trained in 1985 and in training and in sport.
Basio Cortes died recently when the helicopter he operated suffered a setback, along with the Secretary of the Government of the province, Jos√© Francisco Blake Morrow, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05, the rest of Basio Cortes, the inhabitants of Saltillo, came to be transferred to the funeral office of the members of the Mexican Air Force in the head of Major James Martinez, to a training school where his family had already invited him, including his daughter Amanda and his wife, his mother, his brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies found broken on the NL Kaderieta farm
A few hours before the discovery, military authorities showed in the media eleven persons who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found to be shot at in various parts of the body with a control shot at a polluted farm in the village of Kaderiet Hymenes, Nuevo Leon.
The finding was found at 1.5 km from the foot of Kadreyta, on the side of Santiago, at the height of the municipality known as El Castillo.
Several people who had gone by noted that in a wooden house surrounded by a wall in a safe and comfortable way, the doors were open.
Looking inside, literally within three meters, they discovered the bodies of three people, and they immediately informed the authorities.
One of the men was wearing a yellow football with black gins, with no shoes, and another man with him was in a white mother.
The body of the other person, the red robe and the yellow gins, was practically within one metre.
All three were lying down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed in another place, as there were no hostages.
At the gathering of the wooden house there are signs addressed by one organized criminal group, and there are several doors in the door.
11 conceived in Kadrey
The Ministry of National Security represented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that was primarily active in the municipality of Kadrey and who were accused of theft, murder, "pity" and secret funerals.
According to the information published, on 11 November, eight persons were detained in the Los Alvero colony and one person in custody was rescued.
They were provided with three homes and a telephone, demanding that they be members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
The second event took place on 12 November at 06:00 a.m., when the military personnel made a patrol tour of the village of Old Rancho in Kadreyta when they saw a car without numbers with two men in the living room.
I left them and carried out an inspection, and the soldiers found a Winton, a patrol and 18 patrols.
Later, after those statements, one of their communiqu√©s was founded on La Pravd's public land at 14:00 on 13 November, which, in the sight of the military, tried to escape.
He is accused of secret funerals in the municipalities of General Teran, China and Kadreyta.
A new Italian Government will be formed in the middle
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce a new Government facing the crisis putting the country on the brink of economic disaster.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet in the middle with the President of Italy to present a new Government facing the crisis putting Italy on the brink of economic disaster and the most damaging damage to the whole euro area.
A statement from the Presidential Chamber stated that Monti, appointed in the resurrection, would meet with President George Napolitano in order to confirm that he could form a Government.
It is expected that it will present a cabinet consisting mainly of technologies, although it is unlikely that the new executive body will take its positions.
Monty said he would present the results of his negotiations with political parties in his attempt to form the Government.
"I want to confirm my full confidence in our country's ability to choose from this difficult period," said the former European Commissioner for Reporters.
Monty did not directly say that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is now well guarded," he said.
Monty completed the Government's formation process less than three days later, which was much less common, as Italy was struggling with the political and financial crisis, which removed its debt at the critical level
The administration, led by former European Commissioner Monty, should adopt the package of the hard economy required by European leaders to return to Italy.
Based on the pressure on Monty to speed up, unstable markets have established income from Italy's BTP bonds for more than 7 per cent over 10 years, at which levels Greece and Ireland had to save.
Emma Marchegalia, head of the Italian Federation of Workers, told the reporters after a meeting with Monty: "We said we would actively support this Government."
We believe that this is the last chance that Italy has to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's chances of success were largely based on the support of LDP Party Silvio Berlusconi, which was forced to leave on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome," said reporter Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Central Right Party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the Government majority of its members, consisting of the Montenegrins.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monte should have strong parliamentary support for reform, which is likely to be infamous economic reforms.
Any blockade or cessation of these attempts can lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has intensified pressure by warning that the fall in Monty could be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women ' s organizations.
He'll end up at his meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed in the resurrected Napolitano, which allowed a very rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of last week when it became clear that Berlusconi was leaving, Italy's debt value now reached a critical level on the basis of uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would be successful.
Italy's State debt saving of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern euro area financial defenders.
Monty said that his Government would exist before the next elections for 2013, despite the widespread forecasts that policies would only allow him time for reform before the new elections.
Monty said he wanted to include policies in his office, but the main parties insisted that it should be composed only of technical experts, their testimony of their failure to influence the financial situation in the process.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and non-conformity of parties made it difficult to include political figures.
In Spanish game experience more than in Tikos
Of the 22 games claimed in Spain, 10 have already played 50 international matches.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 declared games played 50 matches.
A small contrast with Costa Rica compared 22 games from both countries to a friendly match today at 3:05 a.m. at the National Stadium in San Jos√©.
While the World Championships and Europe, the number one in the FIFA monthly rating, has a full list of Class A selection games, Tricolora has only Michael Human as the only one who has played 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2), in the stadium named Rommel Fernandes.
The Spanish footballers who played in the League of Stars and in the powerful British Premier Clubs were very active during this year in the league and in local Cuban events, and they were high-level players in the European Cups and the League of Champions.
To that end, the experience of the Spanish Forum in the complex qualification of the Euro or the World Championship should be added.
The Tikos, however, have limited international experience in the CONCACAF area, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the list is headed by the Spanish collector Icker Cassilias, who, in the past resurrection against England (the match lost 0-1 in London) re-ex-collar Andony Subsiaret with 126 international matches.
Cassilias is playing against Tricolora today and will set up a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
At Havi Ernandes, the Barcelona game, 106 matches.
Cassilias and Hawaii were best recognized last week by WEFA along with another Iberian team, Subisaret, with 126 fighters and Shalke Raul Gonzalez with 102.
Nearly one hundred Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Havi Alonso followed them with 91, Fernando Torres - with 90, David William and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andr√©s Inesta - with 62, Sesk Fabregas - with 61 and David Silva - with 53.
From Costa Rica along with Michael Umman, left-hand Hunnior Dias with 48 battalions and bomber Brian Ruiss - from 45.
Next, only five crossed the track in 30 games: Keller Navas with 31, Randall Asofeefa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Ernandes with 36 and Jos√© Luis Lopes with 35.
The rest.
More than 30 combatants in Spain in Sierra Pike (37), Serhio Buskets (36), Santiago Cassorla (32), Alvaro Arbelo (31) and Raul Albiola (31).
In a collection of less than 30 out on the field there is Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest didn't even make up to 20.
When only four games at Nach Moreall, and Hordy Albe -- two at Costa Rica in Victor Bolivarian, only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder had not yet been doubted.
The leading game in Spain, David Villa with 50 voices followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica Brian Ruiss, who brought more glasses, two times more than Carlos Ernandes and three times more than Roy Murray and Parks.
Quint√©t included the country in the tour in respect of the twentieth year of career
The trip to Costa Rica is a dream coming true.
In an exclusive interview, Viva bassist Jeff Amen from Pearl Jam said that the group was ready to give one of the best concerts in the next round at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the group says that it is also a dream for them to play in this country.
This was a statement by the bassist and founder, Jeff Amenta, who delivered an exclusive interview from Viva from Brazil last week.
The Group is located in South America within the twenty-year period of work and, on the other hand, 20 are doing its sole stop in Central America.
On that day they will speak at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m. with a team from Los Angeles The X and the local Las Robertas.
It's a waste of words, full of encryption that is available online in The Nation.
For your Costa Rica fans it's a dream that Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica?
The trip to Costa Rica is a dream coming true for us too.
It's just our second visit to South and Central America, and it's still going well.
I was in Costa Rica only once - on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
That's why we're so happy to bring our music there.
I ask this because there is some group devotion; fans live in a hurry day before the concert.
What will you say to your most dedicated fans?
Thanks for being with us all these years.
We needed almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that we needed so much time to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, refer to it as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we played in the past 21 years have been held for the past two weeks.
We held several large shows in San Paulo, and we hope that this has brought us into the shape of this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love to take care of Serfing and Jungle with regard to these two things, Costa Rica - one of the best countries in the world.
How did you find out about Costa Rica and her serfing waves?
We have a lot of serf friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always enjoy serfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as in Mexico, these are excellent places for serfing, as we have learned about it from people who like serfing.
In view of the tour, it can be said that you've done a great show with a lot of songs.
What were you planning to do in Costa Rica?
As we never played there before, we have no limitations on what we can do.
We're trying to make the best show with the most different songs possible; we're trying to play several songs from each album and present to our fans a great variety of repertoires.
You'll never repeat the repertoire.
How's it going?
I think it's partly because we have nine plastics and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in tune and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and that we could forget.
This makes the show more interesting for us, and so I think it makes it more interesting for people.
You've been on this tour for 20 years.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I think that none of us could ever imagine that we would be in the rock group and that what we've been doing for more than 20 years is like a dream.
We are happy for our success, and we are very excited that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and we love creating music.
We are happy to live in a world where we always wanted to go.
Everything is very successful for us.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the border color?
It has always been a privilege to be part of this great collection.
We're good friends with the kids from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
Good when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time, a group from one city appeared, but much more strange when five or ten groups appeared at the same time in one city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle team.
I've been playing with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at a party with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we were happy to be friends with them all and for us to be part of the voice of Seattle that got.
It is also very strange that a group of your species remains together and will last so long.
Yes, four of us were 21 years old together, and Matt (Cameroon) joined us 13 years ago, which is much longer than many groups exist.
First of all, I think it's linked to us that we're still alive, and second of all, we're gonna take care of others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, we have also opened up the musical pathways that give each experiment freedom.
We trust each other's music, and it couldn't be better.
Your attitude toward the word of glory was not easy, but because of your success you were able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
When we grew up, it was easier to find balance.
We'll be careful not to be too long on the tour because it's easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people here are looking for music, it reminds you that you should respect music and what it did, not decide to be famous and to be a rock star, what none of us really cares about.
What do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs, and it was great at first.
We were a group for almost three years and didn't release any albums, which led to Andre Woods' death.
It was a lot of disappointment because it took so long, and most important, that we were still close friends with Bruce (Ferveser) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or see a photograph, I think of an amazing man who was Andy, and as he made me laugh, always had the pleasure of going to work, laughing, talking about music and football and many others.
He was a remarkable man, and we're shooting at him.
The Las Robertas local group will be responsible for opening a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her to open it?
Yes, the vendors sent us some video suggestions, and this was a group that we liked most, so we don't have to see that Las Robertas can offer a live one, and that should be very exciting.
Why are you always changing words in Yellow Ledbetter at the concerts?
That's about Eddie Wedder, so I don't know.
He's taking her and I think he's using the first thing that comes to his head.
Who influenced you like the bassist?
They're so many.
Among the first to come to mind, Giser Butler, John Entvisl, Si Jay Ramon, John Dou, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovski...
They're so many that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the border's relevance even though he was no longer in fashion?
I think we're all feeling a little bit tired of saying the limit.
When I think about it, he reminds me of the groups I mentioned earlier, the types of Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that happened at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's great because it's music that should be heard, and the teams of Mudhoney are now creating music better than ever.
At first your music was darker, and now it was more positive.
How would you explain this change?
It's interesting, as I think, there are some songs in the album that can be said more easily, but there are some types of songs The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, although they may sound a little positive.
Of both when Ed was playing them, I cried when he heard them, these songs were very dark.
I think when you grow up and there was some trauma in your life and you lost a family member or someone else, these events begin to affect your creation and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect it to me.
So I think you can be a happy man and still be able to create dark music.
Peru:
Fuchimori was re-hostilated for medical examination
The ex-President, Alberto Fuhimori, was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to investigate the loss of muscle strength observed in the legs, told his family doctor.
Fuchimori, 72, who has been sentenced to 25 years ' imprisonment for human rights violations during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including cancer, which has been transmitted four times and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Aginga, who is his personal doctor, told television channel N that Fuhimori would be investigated within three days at the National Institute of Non-Plastic Diseases to identify the cause of pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aginga said that he believed that Fuhimori should be a candidate for the benefit of humanitarian mercy; however, he said he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He carried four operations into the language, lost about 18 kilograms of other diseases, such as severe irritant gastritis, subcutaneous iron oxides, stones in his pockets, high blood pressure and problems with blood circulation in his legs, he told the doctor.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the National Police Department for Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the killing of 25 persons by the army's destruction team, which acted in secret during the first year of his reign.
Music is being sent to Mexico to strengthen political communications
The official delegation, headed by President Uruguay Jos√© Mukhiko and a number of ministers and businessmen, will be invited to visit Mexico on this Tuesday to increase trade between the two countries and to start negotiations on political issues in the region.
Muhika will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, the most important point of the expanded plan of meeting with political, commercial and community urguists living in Mexico, as outlined by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of two presidents in the city of Guadalhar will be "beneficial for the exchange of information on political relations between two nations", as the South American country's leadership has published on its website.
According to local media, Mukhika is supported by Calderona for Uruguay in an incident with France, which occurred when French President Nicole Sarkozy included the country of South America in a list of fines at the G20 meeting in Canne.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to remove from the international community those countries that remained taxable persons, a statement that provoked Uruguay's protest and its response to the consultations of its Ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has chaired a G20 group established from the most highly developed and developing countries since November and has, in fact, with the South American country since January of this year, an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to accelerate the conclusion of tax exchange agreements in order to leave this ‚Äúserious list‚Äù of Economic Cooperation and Development Organizations from countries that are not benefiting from international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the Trade Plan, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 with regard to the Free Trade Agreement (STS), which has increased the trade between the two countries.
The water carrier will become three-dimensional with Super Mario 3D Land
Super Mario has been fighting for more than 25 years to save Princess Pitch from Bozer's bad plague, but never before did he do so in three dimensions: "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of girls in stereoscopic technology.
The edition, which will appear in the world-wide stores this month, was created taking into account the characteristics of Nintendo 3DS Portal Consulate, which allows for three measurements without the need to use glasses.
"Mario is a hero who should report how stereoscopying is going to work without glasses," said Nintendo's head of press in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game specially designed under this platform", because until now successful products like Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been the adaptations to the existing game.
The representative of Nintendo stated that despite the existence of 3D, Super Mario 3D Land is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy fast and moving games.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once started, most experts will go "second round" at the level of the game, which is more complex this time.
Also, users can choose between "D aggressive" or something that affects only the depth of action, but which must be played in three dimensions in order to overcome various obstacles and "not subject to optical illusions".
This three-dimensional entrance to Super Mario also refers to the return of the hero to the portative console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo supports the fans of the series and repeats a successful formula from the previous game, and the driver needs to go through dangerously removed platforms to release Princess Pitch.
However, the game finds new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as "playing" Luigi.
The Colloquium guarantees Portillo ' s extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Coloma said on Tuesday that the Alphonso Portillo extradite process had begun to respond in the United States to a withdrawal of $70 million.
This is the end of the process in which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which required that Portillo be issued to be tried there.
At the press conference, Coloma said that its decision was related to the independence of the judicial and executive authorities, bearing in mind that the Court of First Instance had already signed an extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate he did not ‚Äúhand‚Äù to legal decisions and had taken all the extradite procedures he had ever known.
With Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marrokin will be extradited for murder and serious physical injury, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Parades, both for drug use.
What has been done by the Coloma indicates the execution process after all the legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted in order to prosecute the ex-government of the State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CSC), Portillo will be extradite once with a decision on its legal status in Guatemala and guaranteeing its human rights.
Portillo was recognized as innocent at Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a prior extradition process, but the Ministry of Public Relations filed an appeal and the case was reopened.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people from the risk group
The organization was established to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of the Trinijove Social Support Organization are important: 6,000 young people under social isolation have helped overcome the difficult situation during the fourth century.
More than a hundred jobs created for this social group should be provided.
The anniversary was due to the results of a ceremony held in the former factory of Fabra I Coats, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijove appeared in the light of the 1986 Trinita Velya in order to help young people with lack of education, lack of work and drug problems or marginalization.
A large number of responsible organizations and institutions have been working with the association for the past 25 years.
Various political representations during the elections showed the unique nature of the work done by Trinijove.
After the President of the Generality, Artura Massa and his predecessor, Hordi Pohol, visited the ceremony by former Socialist Education Consultant Ernest Maragal and former mayor and current eco-socialist, member of the municipal council of Richard Goma.
There was also the current social welfare and family consultant in Fabra I Coats, Jos√© Luis Cleris and SEO on the social work of La Caixa, Haume Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove had appeared in the light at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but he added that the work done so far was ‚Äúa good basis‚Äù.
The President appointed Trinijove as an example of the fight against bad conditions and of the full hope of people facing difficulties.
"The crisis is not new to the organization and the work it has done," he said.
A captured building where mass festivals were held was evacuated
Abstainers occupied 11 out of 13 floors on the streets of Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday morning without fighting
It is said that the nightmare of neighbors living in house 51 on the streets of Balms was over.
Twenty people left the building on which they had illegally occupied yesterday morning and where they had organized mass parties that had destroyed their neighbors for the decision of the court without interference from the police.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door changed to prevent the situation from recuperating.
"From now on, there's going to be a transitional control here," said the manager.
Squatters who captured 11 out of 13 buildings, the rest of the villages, took all electricity and part of the water, cut down walls and left traces of various kinds, especially alcohol-based banks.
The first three stages were a table for mass dinners, which lasted for two days and scattered the owners.
There is a night club, Balms 51, which has also been damaged.
The governor, Maria Pantinat, told Europe Press that since the building was occupied, its income has decreased by 80 per cent.
The owner of the club says that the owners of the building lured her into unfair coercion, as they sold three euros drinks, while the club was 10.
In addition, the discotheque had to respond to the complaints of its neighbors on the sound, although she noted that the sound was not from the club, but from the people of the kitchen and, above all, from those who visited the parties that hosted there, the frequency and intensity of which increased as the injured neighbors said.
The director of the club said that the inconveniences were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and here is nine months ago, as he "forgives" her rent.
The city police also confirmed that more complaints had been received from neighbors in recent weeks.
The president of the PP municipal group, consultant Alberto Fernand Dias, called for last week ' s "to immediately evacuate the building to address the problems of the existence and general spirit of neighbors and degradation in this area".
The popular leader explained that only one stage of the building had been occupied by the summer, but in the last few months, the cutters had entered all stages and practically every room and some of them had been damaged.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to stand firm against the culture of the building."
So yesterday police members evacuated the building in New Barris.
At 15:30, the police went out to Montreal Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed how four people went into the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree with the possibility of competition after a call for contributions
The 16-door municipal competition resumed the debate on the role of Colserole in Barcelona
In the mid-80th century, under the auspices of the Barcelona Headquarters Corporation (SCB), this administration printed promo-lists for Colserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park of the capital of Barcelona.
Moreover, this was accompanied by comparison in pictures with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the SCB, in 1987, the park again took place in the knowledge of many as Barcelona's high point as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that were not heading north but up (up) down (down) in the sea.
The position of Colserol as a natural park is contrary to this idea.
The prototype was not the Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a mountain cabin in the role of the yoga bear.
That was until, in September, the Council announced the huge events of 16 competitions on many other ports in Colserol.
Under the door is the idea of a park, of course.
Either way, or somebody wants to put the door on the field.
The question is, Colserola, park or mountain?
The events and their organizational side and their impact on the city are the subject of discussion by all the architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most recurring subject that is discussed when two members of this group of chosen people meet each other in the elevator.
And that fact is one of the few similarities between the three Architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Rolldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: co-operation
For Rolanda, after the arrival of the coastal line, it will become "need" to discuss "the front side of the mountain", when the proposal of Ildefon Serdi, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
"It must be allowed that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Besides, thanks to its excellent availability.
Colserole is more complex," says the architect, whose title of the "Colserol gate" contains "the verbal trap": we should not think of them "how to enter the park, but how to limit certain areas where we should act."
The module, such as Rolandan and Bayon with experience in urban construction, called the proposal "intellectual tasks" with "some dangers".
Risks arising from "uncertainty of public space forecasting" after the 80th experience, which ended at the forum "their lebedin song".
The first fear is its own limitation of the border where you can build.
"Limiting something is preparation for the next step," there is a transition.
"We should think of new urban planning tools because current [as regards the General Capital Plan (GSP)] can lead to real disaster."
In the near future, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colserol valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not as a purely topographic issue."
The module recalls that there is already work done outside Calserol, which is ‚Äúnot to be missed beyond the ears‚Äù, although it is grateful for the opportunity that Mary has offered his profession to enter into this project ‚Äúfrom the very beginning‚Äù.
Moreover, he understood that the approach of the mountain to the city was a passage that allowed architects to enter into the debate, but "he doubted" whether this technical profile was to be directed by interdisciplinary teams ("success", he said), which should have been created: "Archidectors should be only instruments".
The bayonet intends that the answer to the question of the title of this part of the competition is as difficult as the rules of the contest do not cover the general nature of Colserol: "There have been 16 cross-border competitions," he says, "but there is no long reading here to see and understand the area as a whole."
At least in its case, it would require 16 competitions to be taken.
On the other hand, the project for one door can be cut by programme and definition with the project architect for the next door.
From your point of view, the Council is committed to ensuring that the area directly above Ronda-de-Dalt should provide in its full area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
The casino's gonna forgive Jonas Larsabal and he'll be released.
After 72 days of settlement, the judge, Red Casino, forgave Mr. Monterey ' s brother in the proceedings against him on appeal.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Ionas Larsabal will be released after he was granted an apology by the Legal Representative of Red Casino before the Second Criminal District Court, which is conducting an appeal against Mr. Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, Governor Red Casino, Serhio Gil Garcia, published a series of photographs and videos where Manuel Jones asked him to pay an economic contribution in order to allow the Monterey authorities to operate secretly in the gambling house.
After a public trial, the Public Prosecutor-General opened a criminal case against Brother Mere and was arrested and sentenced to 30 days in prison on 2 September.
Four hours before an agent of the Ministry of State for the Crime of Heritage, he was sent to a temporary prison in the old part of the capital of the State.
He remained there for 49 days, following the second prohibition of moving after the procurator had eliminated the crimes of take-off and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Kadreit as well as to the owner of the Red Casino, who had just spent several hours in prison with the average isolation of prisoners because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue his detention at San Nicolas in Garz.
On 25 October, the arrest warrant was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Horhe Yanes, who said that, after almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence of Jonah ' s guilt, such as the seizure of 1.5 million pesos from bookmeckers in exchange for an operating permit.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomes, presented to Judge Jos√© Luis Pesino to apologize for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could be released in the following hours.
During the trial, the public prosecutor at the trial, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomes if he had recovered his injuries and who of the gambling partners had been fined, although the lawyer had tried not to make a name.
On the basis of the record of 197/2011, the legal compassion granted by Jonas Larrasabal was granted, and no statements on the process planned against him could be made thereafter; no damage and no punishment would be required.
After hearing the legal representative of the bookmeckers, almost 15:50, he was ordered to release Larsabal Bretton immediately.
The court‚Äôs servant, Horhe Janes, was sent to San Nicolas Prison in Garza to tell Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also inform him of the immediate order of release signed by the judge.
Minister Dionicio Peres Hacome describes the details of the disaster where the Minister of Internal Affairs, Francisco Blake, and seven others were killed.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results of an accident during which the Interior Minister of France Blake Mora and seven other persons were killed showed that the helicopter had hit the ground in full integrity without an attempt by the pilot to carry out an emergency landing.
At the press conference, Dionysio Peres Hacome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that prior to the rise of the aircraft, the pilot explained that the conditions were suitable for flight.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the ship had several contact with land, the wings had entered contact with trees 25 metres away, where the vessel had lost its liquid. "
It also reported that the ship was intended for 19 persons, respectively, in accordance with the requirements for the carriage of persons.
He also said that studies in the area of attack did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
‚ÄúThe study reported that there were no components of the ship in another place, the impact on structural integrity.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the relevant passenger transport requirements.
The earth here has a depth of from seven to 30 degrees.
At this point, the Secretary-General said that the main thing is to get results as soon as possible; however, the study may take months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Mr. Gilbert Lopes Mayer, Director General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the presidential helicopter hit, it was controlled at a creaser speed and that it had happened on a light riser ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of the normal summer manoeuvre at the time of the attack," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of SCT, Peres Hacome, listed six important elements in the survey:
_Visual plane:
According to flight rules, the flight was carried out according to the flight rules, which meant that the command should have visibility during flight and landing.
Suitable conditions:
The AICM reports identified the appropriate conditions for landing when the aircraft was transferred to the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico where the cloud layers were observed at low altitudes.
Selected paths:
It is possible that because of the team's weather conditions, the area is less high and more visible in the Kurnavac Valley.
It's a hit.
The coordinates of the attack and the latest records from the aircraft's radar are likely not to have lost control or change of flight direction before the attack.
Widespread coverage of small areas:
The information available at the same time indicates that the attack occurred on the front and back lines.
The proliferation of clouds indicates that the helicopter has been confronted with land under structural integrity.
No visible signs of fire or explosion have been detected:
In the disaster zone, there are unfounded evidence in the hulls of a ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
The results of recent studies show that there could be multiple land contact.
At the time of the work on the ground, the airships were found at a height of 9,200 feet above sea level, and the ground had a depth of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was broken down.
The information contains facts that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have several contact points from the ground.
After a thorough study in a larger area than the area covered by a disaster site, no fragmented parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that an attack occurred under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announced a life-threatening gene search programme
Social protection is headed by a study on the search for ageing genes in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute for Social Protection (MSSI) announced that it was conducting a study aimed at detecting the gene of pregnancy in children and young people, which had received the name of the protocol ‚ÄúGenetics of childbirth in childhood and adolescent age‚Äù, which would take into account signs related to excess weight.
In his statement, the Head of the Biochemistry Division of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the 21st Century Miguel Cruz Lopes explained that a multi-profile team of therapists, nurses, dietists and social workers had been gathered.
This team is supported by the experts and experts of the National Institute for National Health (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Institute for Political Affairs (NPI).
The study invited the population (as required or not) to participate in MSSI sports centres participating in the study in the valley of Mexico, where tests will be conducted every Saturday at 8:00 a.m. with children.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to be reported at the sports centre in Kuwait ( western Mexico), and since 8 October it was held at the sports centre in Nesaualkotolle (eastern Mexico).
After the goal of attracting 500 to 600 children, the study will continue at the Sports Centre of Independence (South Mexico) and, finally, at the Morelos Sports Centre (Northern Mexico).
He explained that the purpose of this study was to understand the composition and importance of genetics for the development of ageing and to identify a risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent the occurrence of chronic coronary disease.
The World Day to Fight Diabetes will be marked on 14 November and the main goal is to gather three thousand children and adolescents from 6 to 14 years of age with the permission of parents and under their supervision to fill individual food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and about the history of family inherited diseases to avoid the risk factors that lead to disease, such as diabetes or chronic failure.
He explained that on Saturday all participants (weight, growth and volume of oil), blood pressure and glucose levels, fats, cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis (to identify genes related to child exposure).
Crus Lopes said that this study reflected the concern of health professionals about the concern of children ' s weight gain.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicated that there had been an increase of 77 per cent in boys, 47 per cent in girls, and a significant increase in weight was also observed here,‚Äù said MSSI Specialist.
He said that the rationale for the search for markers was based on the fact that the country's population was different from other peoples in its genetic history.
He noted that the average Mexican is 65 per cent of the descendants of American Indians, 30 per cent of the descendants of Europeans and 5 per cent of the descendants of Africans, and this condition has affected the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
He explained that, mainly because of the genetics of light, it was impossible for the body to absorb the energy we consume (calorie), and it was depleted in fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of participants was a comprehensive assessment of children, which could determine whether they had any degree of personal weight or weight.
In fact, he said that there were dark layers of tea (aquats) and interest means that metabolism and even prediabetes were likely to be violated.
Information is provided with all confidentiality, and the doctor transmits it in writing to parents, who explain all the measurements and changes in the way of life that must be taken to avoid illness.
Crus Lopes explained that there are three main causes of excessive weight, light and other chronic diseases: living conditions, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home before television and using transport at small distances instead of walking.
This is also due to high calorie consumption, which is also due to increased use of soft drinks and carbohydrates (tamals, bread, pizzas, hamburgers, etc.) with high levels of fats and proteins and genetic assumptions analysed in this programme.
Asphalt UNAM can avoid thirds
Raphael Errera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical College, developed a polymer-meditated bitumen to produce the best quality mix that has a sustainable effect on the environment and temperature.
If the signals sent by road coverage were to be taken into account, it would have to be reassessed for about 200,000 of them per year in the main area of the Gulf of Mexico, says Raphael Errera Nahera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical College, and adds that if the construction and maintenance of the asphalted road cover process is correct, the amount may be reduced or reduced to zero.
In his lecture, the technological view of the chemical-reading material of the International Year of Chemicals indicates that the laboratory for which it is responsible is developing a polymer-modified bitumen for the production of a mixture of near-bit characteristics, but with better resistance both at high and low temperatures.
Errera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in areas where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north to improve road quality and consequently to counter education.
He explained that the fatiest part of the oil is the traceability of carbon dioxide, some of which is high molecular mass called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular mass called maltens, which together provide road coverage of its characteristic bonded behavior.
The extreme behavior of the Batuma is that at high temperatures about 180 degrees it conducts itself as the frequency at 120 degrees, and at 50 degrees Fahrenheit [50 degrees Celsius] it maintains almost stable, while at very low temperatures it becomes corrupt, he said.
This means that street asphalt resistance is not permanent but changes during the day, depending on the nature and temperature, said a chemical engineer.
A scientist observed that the streets of Mexico are mainly covered by flexible coverings consisting of six layers of material, three of which are composed of bitumen.
Among the top layers are bitumen made up of small stones cast into bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that makes up this cover, he says it's loaded in a bit.
The movement of vehicles and the exercise of effort helps forces to be well distributed on the road.
If it were modified asphalt, they would be better distributed, the chemical engineer would say.
On the asphalt cover, he added the last layer, which is called a layer of imports made from a small stone, actually also the sand of the asphalt.
As it is a layer that will be contacted by transport trains, it must have more resistance than asphalt coverage and road training.
As part of the road cover that will be obtained and disseminated, the volume of exports also requires an appropriate volume, and the material from which it is produced must be taken into account.
The weather, particularly the humidity and temperature fluctuations, are also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it has a significant impact on the asphalt status.
When the soil is dry, water penetrates the surface and it is difficult to get out of there, it causes the mixture of all layers of cover and, therefore, education.
In his education, he said that the export industry was first introduced and only then affected by the bitumen, but the damage was not measurable, which should be given attention to the first signs of the current repair programmes.
A member of the National System of Researchers also explained that transport is another important factor in the training of doors, and therefore the density of each layer of coverage should always be linked to the transport load and it should be ensured that this requirement is met in order to prevent its frequent occurrence.
Raphael Errera said that with regard to bitumen there is still much to study and do, for example, bitumen emulsions that are already on the market in other countries and even help make them easier and without high temperatures.
Why didn't a Wally candidate get to become a new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons why Sirne Meline Ramires was involved in getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
The representative of Val√© received the title of the princess 14 times.
On a regular basis, Val√© del Kauka was just trying to capture the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramirez Sirna had to be satisfied that she had fallen on the ground with a silver crown and a banner announcing her new princess of Colombia.
In view of the results achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and skipper, the department is composed of 14 princesses, and Melina joins the Vale de Cauca legion of women who were close to the crown, but were announced by the princesses, including Mir√≠as Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Dominigh (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Laurena Alvares (1981), Rose Marie Alessa (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), L√©ella Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Monica.
The question that many are asking now:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favour, which has shown in each of the statements that it has everything to become a new Miss Colombia, not only was she chosen by the Royal Police and the most beautiful person on the Vogue version of the titles of the Queens, such as Tatyana Vargas or Natalie Navarro, who received the crowns of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the decision of the jury to condemn the title of the First Princess was that she could not answer the question "What book characterizes you and why? The question of Martin Muriel Gomez from the literature society is that we respect him.
She answered the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I definitely think that a book that characterizes my childhood is a "Little Prince" -- a pretty deep book.
Today I read "Crime and punishment" this is the world's set of literature that we should all read; and at this point I also read the book Irina Nemrivski, the Russian writer, a wonderful book called "The Fire of Blood".
The answer that did not interest the jury because of the term "culture" and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the cited books characterise it.
But after Melina's ceremony, she said she was calm and pleased with her result: "The wisdom of the universe, what must happen."
And you all, please, read at least a little, "Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the heard hypotheses ‚Äì Val√© burned from favoriteism.
The report from Bogot√° suggested that, given her preference, she had met with opiations, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Culinary decoration of Ostera, national best-dressed vote, and Queen-Matt), "which aroused the zeal of other candidates, caused the king's stress, and did not focus on the scene".
And this was noted during her first appearance in the buyer at the Hillton beach and during two shows at the evening coronation.
Although it seemed convinced, it was noted that it did not have the strength and energy shown by the representatives of Magdalen and Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the RCN Canal RCN, said that the fact that Milan was called a princess " means that a candidate who wins more prize during the competition will not become a king"
In addition, the representative of Val√© has recently been out of touch with the press and this has been wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Val√© has failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Contest of Crasoto.
That's why two days before the election of a member of the international jury, Lucy Dotty said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty that is not enough for Mrs. Colombia, we must look not only at externality but also focus on public awareness before they take part in the competition, they must already be involved in the projects," she said.
There is also the assumption that the representative of Valie has made mistakes in the egg and fibrosis that have been seen in her life, but this is controversial, as the jury particularly noted her as a "natural beauty" candidate, taking into account her healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
King's adviser, Horhe Ernan Orosco, notes that Melina had no better body than they had, "but the problems of fibrosis in life which have not been very noticeable to me have caused her to lose her eyes in the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oios of Cromos believes that the fault of the representative of Val√© de Kauka was that she was involved in surgery.
"The operations are good, but the representative of Vale doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the price that was first awarded to the organizers of the National Competition for Beauty, the cruel prediction came last night, they say that this was the child that Raymondo gave Melina as a compensation for her lack of satisfaction with the crown.
Whether that is so or not, the fact that today Melina is beginning her year of rule, not as a queen, but as a princess, gives her the opportunity to present Colombia to one of the international events outlined directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
It will, however, come into history as one of the kings who, despite his superior position at the Cartagena competition, faced difficulties in obtaining crowns.
That was the work of a man who recognized the body of Alphonso Cano.
A criminal from Cali came into history as a man who confirmed the death of Alphonso Cano.
The work of these servants is key.
On 4 November CTI criminal Kali entered history as a person who confirmed the identity of the head of FARC Alfonso Cano in comparison with his fingerprints.
Of the seven CTI criminals this week, Elizar Gonzalez, a 21-year-old indictee from Puerto Tehada, was ordered to "run" this week.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to spend more than five days through the jungle in order to reach places where bodies needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Val√©, and after completing the relevant courses, he became a specialist in criminalism, where he studied leather training, that is, leather and stone.
During the week of Eliezer's human identification operation, known as Alphonso Cano, he was told to wear no more than three days ' clothes.
Something big was coming up.
On Friday night, he arrived at the airport of Kauka in Palmir.
He knew that he would have to meet two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest party war, so they asked him to take ten photographs of Gilermo Leon Saens (his current name).
However, when he arrived with a research team at a place where the body was located, he did not know him outside; he was very different from what he had shown in the media.
He was without fights, dressed as a local farmer, without glasses and a lot of dirt.
But prints don't work.
Using a large glass, a black box, a pencil and a phonograph, Eliezer compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the picture.
He wasn't blind: it was Alphonso Cano.
That same night, the representative of Puerto Tehad asked Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinson to confirm that he was the head of the RVSC.
Search for fingerprints
The recognition received by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliseros at the press conference on the Operation against Cano was particularly significant for the specialist in the field of doctiloscope of Sijin from Kali.
Many people don't know what we're doing.
Dactiloscopy is a hard science, without a mistake, it can play a key role in discovering crimes.
In addition to the identification of the body, Dactiloscope experts participate in investigation of such crimes as theft and murder and establish the identity of the detainees.
Many criminals have separate certificates or do not have documents when detained.
We'll get their prints and find them at the base.
The researcher said that in the case of theft, he had to take down the wall of the house because the door was working with his hands in order to hold a safe, complete treasure and money.
‚ÄúIt is difficult to work with walls because they are not comfortable surfaces for printing, but in this case we can take photos of the entire ship and establish the identity of the criminal who participated in several countries,‚Äù he says.
Prints also help to exclude or establish the participation of suspects in murder cases.
A dead man was recently found with bottles from under the elevator around him.
The investigation found that a relative could be suspected of committing a crime and that, in fact, fingerprints were dropped.
Although it doesn't guarantee he was a killer, it proves he was at the murder site.
Dactiloscope specialist from CTI explained that a chemical or physical reaction is present where there are prints.
When they show up, they use a ball or tape to remove them.
Posts are then sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals or are registered.
"The problem is we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as indicated in the CSI telegram.
Just like not all the gold that blows, not everything you pull, leaves prints on you.
However, if that is possible, comparison is made.
The "disgusting people" challenge New York's authorities
Hundreds of protesters broke down the camp in front of the Zucketti area.
Some of the protesters listened to the court‚Äôs decision to expel the demonstration from the area and were sent to a nearby park.
The members of the "Take Wall Street" movement threw a call to the New York authorities on Tuesday when they were trying to find out again, under a judicial order, at Manhattan, where they were evacuated to the light when they were trying to capture another major Yablock park.
Hundreds of protestors jumped into the area of Zukotti, where they wanted to fall because of a court order that allowed the "warned people" to break camp on the ground until the rest of the movement responded to the attack, captured the park in the north of the city where further arrests were held.
"Our idea is that once the court does not allow us to break the camp on the ground, we will break the camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle to return to Zukotti and through peaceful arrests and demonstrations," said one of the representatives of the movement "Take Wall Street" Mark Bree.
Bree explained that the response to the ‚Äúdisgusting people‚Äù to the evacuation of the palace town, which was ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued a decree prohibiting violent evacuation from the premises and allowing demonstrators to stay in the camp.
In addition, "distorted people" began to capture a new park located at the site of the Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, just outside the entrance to the Netherlands tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey and is owned by the Trinity Church.
At least for a while they could take this place, but then the police arrived and began arresting some of the protesters, although Bree could not call the exact number, but Efe said that he saw several journalists who were also in the hands.
The organization is convinced that several hundred people have been with the Houses in a place where the delegation of religious leaders has been sent to show support for members of the movement, trying to speak as an intermediary in negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, the area of Zukotti, which is a private government, remains closed in the waiting for a hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, which will consider the legitimacy of today's morning protesters.
Some of the protesters who were sent there carried and distributed copies of the court order at the same time and even gave these copies to the police security area, which led to "some small meetings", said Bree, who said that some police were demonstrators.
The judicial decision prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the "Take Wall Street" movement and imposing "laws that were issued after the beginning of the arrest or from re-accessing demonstrators to the park with stores and other property used earlier".
Mr. Bloomberg told the reporters that because of this decision, the city court had ceased opening public space and the demonstrators had been informed about it, but local laws did not allow them to reopen palaces and bedrooms.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from the area of Zukotti, conducted in light, the operation during which about 200 arrests were conducted, and the decision was taken because the protestors ‚Äúwere in violation of the law‚Äù.
Blumberg said he gave orders to clean the area because it became "a place where people came not to protest but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm others", such as "some companies were threatened" and neighbors were afraid of "lost quality of life".
The evacuation, carried out this morning, was disgusting and showed that Bloomberg's soul was more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers," added the representative of the movement, who condemned the mayor for "irrepreciation of freedom of speech".
They also indicated that they were planning to organize "grandsome actions" on Thursday, in collaboration with public organizations and trade unions, in order to remember the last two months of protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson becomes the Virgin Mary in a special birth TV show
Together with Michael Buble and other Canadians, she will appear on the television program Russell Peters on 1 December.
Canada Pamela Anderson was a helper to Tim Allen in the "Great Repair", a rescuer in the "Savior of Malibu", Banni in the "Pleiboe", a woman of rock music, Tommy Lee, and now an actress and model will become the Virgin Mary in a special birthday show on Canadian television.
The CTV partial TV announced today that Anderson, along with the cloner (ballad executive) Michael Buble and other Canadians, will appear on the television program Russell Peters on 1 December, in the role of Mary's special role.
CTV presented today a television show in which Anderson, also known for its wide-ranging home pornography video on the Internet, where she depicted herself together with her former husband, the drummer of the M√∂tley Cr√©e group, Tommy Lee, appeared as a dresser like Deva Maria, held in a wooden doll depicting Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, known as the Canadian comec of Indian origin, who recently spoke as the leader of the "My Cruel Torch of Truth" tour, appears in the role of Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV participated in a special birthday show by the Canadian singer Bubble, who was married in Buenos Aires at the end of March on the Argentine model Luisian Lopilato.
Buble recently called American "succo" Kim Cardahisyan during one of his concerts in New York
Japan born after the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and ended the drop rate that started in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and has been relieved of the devastating earthquake caused by the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that has occurred since the Second World War.
According to the first estimates of the Government of Tokyo, material losses amounted to $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the heavy world situation, is likely to occur.
Following the three loss quarters, data on the main domestic product from July to September have definitely helped to transform the page: GDP grew by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and 6 per cent in the annual calculation.
The second quarter, which was registered for the Japanese financial year beginning in March 2012, also reflects the fastest growth rates from January to March 2010.
Reproductiveness may be partly due to the repurchasing of machinery to restore areas left by landfill and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against the decrease in 0.9 per cent of capital expenditure, which was observed from January to March, the first decrease after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real breakdown in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the casino impulse, which calls for a crisis of strengthening or restructuring infrastructure, using holes to grow from zero.
Japan was emerging mainly through domestic consumption, which now accounts for 60 per cent of Japan's GDP.
This figure has increased by 1 per cent by increasing the cost of cars, travel and rest.
We're on our way.
Tokyo provided the internal market when it, the Japanese currency, became one of the "moving-foreign" investors selected to survive a long-term euro area crisis and negative forecasts about the United States, a privilege which confers on exporting companies as a stone.
At a much more expensive currency, road production is outside, which is a serious blow to the country whose economic course is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sonni, for example, blames the iron in their low performances from July to September.
As long as markets continue to exist in the EU peripheral countries, the Government of Eshiko Noda does not reduce vigilance.
We must be aware of the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid increase in the value of iron, said Minister of Economic Policy Motohis Furukawa yesterday.
In fact, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most countries had demonstrated clear signs of economic activity decline in September.
The indicator predicting global economic imbalances has shown that the main forces are slowing down.
It then fell from four decimal places to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone has even fallen below the average value of 100 points after it has collapsed from eight to 99.13 points.
The Affinities Again Give the Land to Doubts
The latter said that the correction would be approved, but the conservators would not sign any written obligation.
With the peripheral premiums for risk and uncertainty in the parks, Greece continues to go wrong on the maze leading to a major European debt crisis.
It was felt that the ‚Äúagreement‚Äù of the new Transitional Government of Ellade was linked to the requirements of Brussels rather than to the true belief of the political forces.
While new Prime Minister Lucas Fallamos warned yesterday that there were no structural reforms alternatives and that the period agreed upon by his appointment might be insufficient for their use, the Conservative Party leader, Mr. Antonis Samaras, assured that no new economic measures would be supported in any case and reiterated his request for new elections on 19 February.
The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October, said Padalimos yesterday, opening up parliamentary debates that will be open to the new executive authority's confidence tomorrow.
A package of 24 programmes for increasing the employment of the population, reform of the Public Service Discipline Code and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovation.
However, the message of Samaras does not raise doubts about its position: "We are ready to help the Transitional Government, but we do not promise anything."
The Conservative Leader has taken more than one step in its views on the EU and IMF, organizations that need to distribute 8,000 million urgently needed Afina and has explained that he will not receive any letter of agreement from him.
But the European Commission, while still trying to break the effect of the Papandreu referendum's approvals in the style of everything or anything, reiterated yesterday that its requirements are of equal importance: it will not resume aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main parties of Greece do not sign "a written agreement without any doubt and as soon as possible".
The representative of the Ministry of Economy Amadeu Altafai said that the inspectors of the three could "be very soon" return to Athens to discuss with the new Government what "to be done for payment of the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been specified.
In the Greek club, he's got a knife for a while.
Ms. Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The King stressed Spain's "main" position on this type of finance
Spain "has taken a visible place in the world in the area of microfinance".
King Sofia recalled yesterday that over the last two decades, the country has become the second donor to the instruments of cooperation, which she said, ‚Äúthe essence‚Äù, is that it is ‚Äúa tool for social progress, justice and hope for the better future of all humanity based on faith in men‚Äù.
The King has opened yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Validolide with the belief that ‚Äúthere is no doubt‚Äù, that such actions are ‚Äútoo necessary‚Äù, in order to achieve the objectives of the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and that ‚Äúa special objective is to reduce the number of people living less than one dollar a day ‚Äì the level of poverty identified‚Äù.
Spain ‚Äú Still working‚Äù to expand the world-wide network of recipients and take on this task with all ‚Äúresponsibility‚Äù, says South Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements made at the summit that will continue until Thursday will be ‚Äúproviding new capacities and opportunities for the poorest people, especially for women, ‚Äúthe main beneficiaries of these cases‚Äù.
There's a lot of achievements here and a lot of difficulties we're facing.
The microcredit summit becomes not only a platform for disputes but also a platform that contributes to "two main objectives".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that it hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and that hundreds of millions of such households would be deprived of their poverty.
The push for the establishment of a microcredit system in Spain and throughout the rest of the world "roads to the beginning of the years" by Muhammad Unus, stressed Ms. Sofia as "the Act of Justice and Recognition".
And she described the instrument's father as ‚Äúan empty idealist in the overall fight against poverty‚Äù, whose work has been known for 15 years since the Queen was sent to Bangladesh to study his credit policy.
This experience last year took place at the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in C√¥te d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "I have seen continuous development everywhere," said Her Majesty, whose connection with this project had led to the title of "family heads", gathered in Valyadolide "banker of the poor".
Finally, King Sofia concluded a statement calling on the participants to participate in the discussion and to find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Empire"
Minister for Foreign Affairs Trinidad Hymenes said solidarity was a "ethical imperative" for each democratic State.
In this regard, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with economic times, such as ‚Äúpermanent obligation‚Äù.
Hymenes concluded that microcredit was supposed to be "a serious and firm course towards poverty eradication", and now "more than ever" the Governments of developed countries should work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to be cost-effective.
For Spain, microcredit is ‚Äúone of the main areas of development cooperation‚Äù.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soria Rodriguez, highly praised "the success" in giving "confidence" to people "departed before which all doors are closed", and Mr. Valyadolda, Francesco Havier de la Riva, welcomed all who were present in the city, who "opens its door covered by a spirit of solidarity".
HDS proposes that the President of the Eurocommission be elected by a general vote
On Monday, 14 November, the first day of the Christian-Democratic Union Congress (HDS) in Leipzig, there was no significant problem for Angel Merkel, who was also president of the Christian-Democratic Party.
The future of Europe has not been well planned in the programme, but it has come up with a sense of urgency, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that government policies are not as strict as they should be today in relation to Greece and perhaps tomorrow in relation to Italy....
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, which was discussed by the Governing Council, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained from voting.
The arrests, which continued for a few minutes, which were due to their statements by Angel Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Shoble, the Europhil and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the true response to the crisis is "not less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, it's time for a break in Europe.
This could mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty which would enhance the European Union's control over the financial policy of the countries of the eurozone, but could also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a general vote to give a European person.
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by the Congress, which is obviously part of Wolfgang Shoble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will agree with this decision quickly; Britain is against it, and HDS leaders believe that Nicole Sarkozy is against it too.
But the soil's ready.
In a similar way, delegations to the overwhelming majority rejected the proposal to raise the vote of each Member State of the European Union in the governance of the European Central Bank in accordance with the size of the economy of each of them, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
In order to ease the situation in his party, the Chancellor has increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kolya, but she has not tried to influence the "small" European countries or countries in a difficult situation who want to criticise Germany "high-level".
Although the whole paragraph of the draft resolution on Europe referred to the importance of ‚ÄúGerman-French friendship‚Äù, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
It's just a joke.
I remember two centuries ago, Leipzig became a blood battle scene.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What's the mess with the hospital letters?
As a result, UMP and the Government began accessing hospitals.
On 15 November, Nicole Sarkozy invited Bordo to visit the Family Benefit Distribution Fund and to address the issue that has been periodically raised since 2007 on combating fraud in the field of social benefits.
And in order to help this event, which has resulted from the desire to save in a difficult situation, but which is also part of the presidential re-election campaign, most would like to focus on hospital letters.
Firstly, in the context of the budget economy, the Government intends to bind private companies on the fourth day of unpaid leave before the start of payment of benefits.
It is evident that, without the particular agreement of the employer, the sick worker loses his salary for four days, at least 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens the birth of a storm of anger but which, according to Les Echos, leads to the economy of EUR 280 million.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, i.e. to bind public officials one day without payment for sickness benefits (State servants have not yet had to pay benefits, unlike the three-day waiting in the private sector).
Now, when these issues are discussed, most of them also raise the subject of fraud, which is used in the issue of hospital letters.
Control will become more stringent and additional, if you are taken, you will have to return all the illegal payments you have received," Xsavie Bertran warned on the RTL channel on Saturday, 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement has been a number of minor real abuses with hospital records.
They have been under constant control and political attacks since 2002.
People in France suffer no more than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's first look at the country's numbers.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Studies and Documentation, the daily cost of compensation in 2008 amounted to 5 per cent of the total health costs.
Of these, 46 per cent were affected by the direct release and accidents in production and 54 per cent by disease benefits, amounting to EUR 6.2 billion.
As a result, 2.5 per cent of expenditure related to health have been reported.
France spent an average of 14.5 days in the hospital in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to the Alma Consulting Group.
Another study published by the Monster.com career management site in 2007 showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken any day of hospital.
Another study on health insurance this time found that 37 per cent of patients were under 8 days, 15 per cent of 15 days a month, 15 per cent from one to three months, and 11 per cent were further away in 2010.
In comparison with the numbers of European neighbours, it is evident that French workers are no longer willing to take care of the hospital than workers in any other country.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the total share of unemployment in France (for health or not) was between 10 and 11 per cent, compared with 20-28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16-18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of disability associated with hospital letters is very low compared to "serious" employment.
With regard to the level of disability, it is very low.
The enforcement of the law after 2002 has resulted in a systematic examination of hospitals for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million cases examined by CNAM, 13 per cent of 285,000 short-term disease findings were "unreasonably" or too long", which is 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematic medical examinations, over 45 days of more than 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were ‚Äúunplaceable or unreasonable‚Äù, equivalent to 132 000.
It is generally found that 169 000 cases were ‚Äúunreasonably‚Äù for several million workers who received hospital letters.
The figures that show very few cases compared, for example, to the "serious" figures of employment.
According to UMP Dominica Tiana, the author of the report on this issue in June, they amount to 9 to 15 million euros of unencumbered budget income per year, which exceeds the total daily reimbursement costs, and consequently, consistently above the loss of fraud.
Disaster: Greece should follow a new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papalimos said that his coalition Government had failed to fulfil this task within 100 days.
"To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and the new budget adjustment programme," the Head of Government, who made his first public statement, opening up a debate on confidence in Parliament in the middle.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October should be "the main task" of the new Government, since the country ' s presence in the Eurozone is "put on map", he added.
Accordingly, the State budget deficit is projected to decrease by about 9 per cent from GDP to the end of the year, at 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Rights reject the measures of the new Government
On Monday, Mr. Antonis Samaras, the leader of law, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to escape the long-term crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional measures of the strict economy.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with the MPs from his party the New Democracy.
He expressed his agreement with the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating expenditure, but also his rejection of any course that hinders the recovery of the economy.
Ollie Reno, the European Commissioner for Economics and Finance, who warned that IMF and the EU would not block the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without written guarantees from all parties, which they would support planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
The Committee of Experts should legislate on euthanasia and suicide with side-by-side assistance
Canadians refuse to die, is confirmed in the report of the Royal Canadian Society
With regard to palliative medicine, the Committee claims that the Government, health institutions and doctors are working together to provide the best palliative assistance, without considering cancer.
The Canadians refuse to die.
Only 9 per cent of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts from various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the Criminal Code in order to permit suicide with foreign assistance and evasion when this option is forced by circumstances and the patient may be considered competent to take such a decision.
For the first time, experts referred to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada is located in 10 places, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to dispute the subject of death".
Medically or not, but 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative assistance, experts appointed by the Royal Canadian Society report.
And 68.6 percent of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest rate in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and suicide, the authors of the report come to the conclusion that they disagree with the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code with respect to euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid.
Now, according to experts who have also examined the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or have been demarcated, there is no evidence that such demarcation would lead to abuse, whether it is the exercise of euthanasia or suicide with side-by-side assistance against persons who cannot or do not want to take such a decision.
On the contrary, he confirmed during a teleconference by Joselin Dauni, who presented the report, most of these cases were in countries where eutanization and suicide were not legalized with foreign aid.
Evthanasia is being practiced in Canada where it is obviously illegal.
Self-sustainment with foreign aid is practiced in Canada, where it is apparently illegal, explains Joselin Downey.
Canadians After the Utanization
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of Canadians speak for themselves because, according to Angus Reida's 2010 survey, they believe that this will make it easier for people at the end of their life to suffer.
66 per cent are of the view that the legalization of Ethanian will not be a sign that the lives of older persons or persons with disabilities are less valuable.
With regard to those who assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of the respondents felt that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for the sick, the situation is less significant, the authors of the report are speaking.
They also propose, in addition to their other recommendations, that the criminal code should establish that the legal end of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in a spirit of respect for the rejection of medical care at the end of life without fear of criminal persecution.
With regard to palliative assistance, the Committee calls on the Government, the health services institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best palliative assistance available, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to a palliative or terminal session already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to treat physical pain such as Ethanas and subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some health-related legal experts have already commented on the conclusion of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Mr. Peter Dashan, a health law expert, described as "land" the position of experts who signed the report, since, inter alia, it does not limit the use of Uthanasian in fatal cases.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who has stopped living and who is over 18 years old can ask for help in committing suicide, says metr.Dechan, who discussed the summary report yesterday.
Mer Desham also stressed that the authors of the report appear to be above all other values that constitute social fabric.
He said that "There are warning signs and prohibitions in society".
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, also expressed "the category of disagreement with the conclusions of the report she called "manifest for Ethanas".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, argues, inter alia, that reports on abuses in some countries, where euthanasia and suicide are legitimized as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Asada to take power
Damask's judging "the answer"
Syria is all in greater isolation
The parties to Barara Asada conducted a demonstration yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday, a diplomatic pressure on Syria, Barazar Asada, who, with Russia's support, was opposed and condemned as a "salvation" against his country.
Two days after the withdrawal of Syria from the League of Arab States, the European Union imposed sanctions on Damascus, and the Syrian neighbours of Turkey and Jordan withdrew from President Asada.
King Abdullah II of Jordan became the first Arab leader yesterday, who, at the invitation of President Barazar Asada, seized power in Syria, where more than half of the civilian and armed forces were killed.
"If Barara had been the road to his country's interests, he should have given up, but he should also have established the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, said the king of Jordan, who is next to Syria, in the BBC.
In turn, Turkey ' s Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that Turkey ' s media efforts at the beginning of this year had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations are losing their power, he said, referring to Syria as a neighbouring country with which Turkey is increasingly in a harsher position.
On the other hand, the United States welcomes the ‚Äúincreasing consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime‚Äù following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey, have increasingly taken a more rigorous course in relation to repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, representative of the State Department.
At the same time, 16 civilians and at least 19 representatives of the armed forces of the regime were killed in the Dara region of southern Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Watch (OSH).
Two other residents were killed at the time of the shooting and shot at the heavy rockets in Jobara in Homs, according to the NGO.
During the press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Valid Muallem stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis."
In addition, he reacted strongly to the decision of the League of Arab States to eliminate Damascus, which he said was a ‚Äúdangerous step‚Äù.
Syria will not be broken, he adds, and he believes that the promise against Syria will fall.‚Äù
Following its decision to eliminate Syria from the League of Arab States, the Syrian Arab Republic is currently studying ‚Äúthe mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers in the country.
French Foreign Minister Allen Juppe also mentioned sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which, he said, fell into ‚Äúparano‚Äù.
The new emergency meeting of the League was planned to discuss tomorrow at work the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November and providing, inter alia, for the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities where the fighting is taking place and for the release of arrested demonstrators.
yesterday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the Arab League ' s "missive" decision, while China called on Syria to implement a crisis exit plan but refused to support possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty needs time in the markets and victims of the Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, asked markets for some time to form its team and implement a programme that would require " Victims" to restore the credit capacity lost in the last few months of the Berlusconi regime.
The former European Commissioner participated in discussions with political parties yesterday before today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
It must form a relatively measurable cabinet consisting of non-members of the Parliament.
Monti spoke of the importance of the programme that was expected to be very much victimized, said Francesco Nukara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups participating in the discussions following a meeting with the candidate for the Prime Minister.
The Speaker of the House of Deputies, Janfranco Fini, said he would expect to know whether Mario Monti would ask Parliament to vote on Friday to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting will end with the presentation by Mr. Monty of a limited list from the district or by the ministers of the capital of the country, George Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on yesterday's nervousness of the fund exchanges and bond holders, asking them for time.
‚ÄúDemocratic time is needed for the preparation of Governments and programmes,‚Äù he stressed, adding that he was convinced that the markets would be patient and understanding.‚Äù
His appointment to the President was initially approved by the markets, but concern arose again, especially after the unexpected fall of industrial production in Eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister had to form a team that included, most importantly, technology, although he stressed that he would also want to include "politics".
The new Government will have to act by 2013, the date of the next elections, he said.
According to the speaker of the House of Deputies, Jean-Franco Fini, the new Government will receive a vote of confidence on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that by entering the post, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would once again become an important active person in Europe.
The representative of European Commissioner Ollie Rehn stressed that "in spite of the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed".
The European Union, which was convinced that Rome would not implement the budget for 2013, despite the strict economic plan adopted in recent months, needed, in particular, new strict measures.
The Italian bosses Emma Marchegalia, who met him on Tuesday, also stressed the need to re-start the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot comply with the parameters of the deficit."
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence at the home of the European Commissioner (1994-2004), introduced "the change of age" for Italy after 17 years "berlusconnym", "professor", a symbol of "the challenges of seriousness" and "the other Italian", according to the authors of the predecessors.
The length of his command is unknown.
President Napolitano would like to avoid the rapid elections, as Italy should pay for public debt obligations of EUR 200 billion by April 2012.
Russian scientist assisted the Iranian nuclear programme
Russian scientist Veƒçeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, confirmed the American nuclear safety agency Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other United Nations documents to establish the identity of that scientist.
In the past week, IAEA expressed concern about the ‚Äúprobably military aspect‚Äù of the Iranian nuclear programme
According to ISIS, which was largely based on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, "from the age of sixty years, at the Soviet war nuclear centre in Chelabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic explosives".
In 1989 or 1991, he moved from the centre to create a company that produces nano-alms in Kiev.
The financial difficulties of his company brought him into contact with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then worked with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 before returning to Russia
In its report, IAEA referred to ‚Äúthe apparent signs that Iran‚Äôs development‚Äù of the nuclear detonator system ‚Äúhas contributed to the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technique but also has reported to the agency that he has worked most of his career on this technology within the framework of his country‚Äôs military nuclear programme‚Äù.
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50%
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday between 2009 and 2010, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent, while other forms of racial and religious violence were slow or unchanged during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, corresponding to 49 per cent, compared to an increase of 13 per cent in Catholic violence, a decrease of 4 per cent in Jewish attacks and a total increase of 14 per cent in religious land crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, has increased significantly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
After the fall in 2009, concern was expressed that the number of these crimes was again increasing, with the human rights organization Human Rights First, ‚Äúincreasing cases of violence against Muslims in particular‚Äù, the organization added in its official report.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered as serious violations of human rights," added one of the leaders of Paul Legandr's organization.
"The Government of America can and should do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this could be done by improving police reports on hate crimes."
The federal law 's " hate crimes " are the legacy of a period of civil rights struggle.
This law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, color, religion, nationality and sexual orientation in our day.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook
On Monday's Twitter microblog site, changes were made in the presentation of its platform that would allow its users, in particular to see the activity of those they observe doing this service similar to Facebook.
The new "activities" and other "name" tab allows you to follow more easily and directly from other "twitter" users whose messages you are tracking, and those who are tracking yours.
This allows them to know if they publish messages, if they sign new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was protested "by a small percentage of users in August" before the launch of a wide-ranging network on Monday, AFP said Twitter Secretary Carolin Penner.
Twitter, which has been known for a long time as an intuitively unexplained and unexplained term (RT for re-existence of someone else, #followfriday for recommendations to follow other users), is primarily a source of satisfaction to experienced users, thus opening themselves up for a wider audience, presenting users something closer to the popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
In the network users discussed this update using "Twits" on the Internet.
"It's useless, boring and boring, and it reminds Facebook."
Functional activity will help me better track down certain elements of my stream on Twitter, wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction to the Constitution of the Golden Rule
The leadership of a major coalition of social Democrats and Christian Democrats in Austria decided on Tuesday to write down a "gold rule" in a constitution to reduce budget deficits and thus avoid possible reductions by state credit rating agencies in Austria (three A).
The Chancellor of Social Democrat Verner Fayman personally announced this decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, while Austria ' s State debt was 74.6 per cent higher than the upper limit of the 60 per cent standard established by the Maastricht Treaty but below the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's ability to pay is limited to one point, from AAA to AA+, we should pay interest to three thousand million euros more each year, bringing the argument of Deputy Chancellor and Foreign Minister of Christian Democrats, Michael Spindelegger.
Thus, Austria meets the demands of the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels; Heads of State and Government needed to reduce budget deficits by the end of 2012 and return to balance government accounts through the Constitution or by equivalent law.
The decision adopted by the Austrian Government calls to mind the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt that "rule".
By 2017 the structural deficit of the public budget should be reduced to 0.75 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) per year, and since 2017 the structural deficit of the federal state budget should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP per year, and the countries, like municipalities, should represent balanced budgets.
The objective of imposing a State debt is to reduce the 60 per cent of the notes under the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Esikiko Noda
threatened new intervention on the currency market
The Prime Minister of Japan, Esikhiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would take new intervention on the currency market if the value of eggs continued to grow.
We are involved in how they have done this in the past, if we consider the overvoltility of the exchange course of iron, explained Mr. Noda Senate.
On Tuesday, Ian grew almost to a historical note, which prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold an iron for a large amount of dollars to reduce the cost of Japan's currency, which had established a new force record since 1945.
But since then, iron has been constantly rising, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it to be ‚Äúa refuge‚Äù in these difficult times of economic downturn across the world and in the long-term crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, 77 yen fell, and the euro dropped down the symbolic plan in 105 yen, almost at the level that prompted the last intervention.
The financial crisis in 2008-2009 was about 120 yen and more than 160 yen euro.
Japan's currency growth is detrimental to Japan's exports, as Japan's products make it more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese companies from abroad when they convert into national currency.
" Japan is fighting to restore itself" after the earthquake and tsunamis of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoque region (North-East), stressed Mr. Noda, who was afraid that this growth would kill the terrible legacy of recovery.
The third in the world, by size, has resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter - for the first time in the year, due to the increase in exports and consumption of households affected by disasters
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of iron does not reflect "the fundamental economic indicators of Japan".
Minister of Finance of June Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened its two-day meeting on monetary policy on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the iron.
However, the Deputy Managing Authority Hyrohid Yamaguti warned that Japan's Bank had already taken "the appropriate steps" to realize that no further relief in the middle should be expected.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the broadcasting organization increased the purchase of camouflage bonds by 5,000 million yen (77,000 euros) and raised up to 55,000 yen (519 million euros) to the amount it allocated to the purchase of various financial instruments in order to attract the price book market.
Eurozone
Rates of growth, fund exchanges
The risk of a debt crisis is jeopardizing European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new heads of State in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to grow.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European burgeons arrived on Tuesday, 15 November, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris on 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and ended trade at level 3.064.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
As a result of new difficulties in the payment of loans to the euro area countries in difficulty, the global financial markets continue to suffer part of their recent achievements.
"Effected investors are simply too worried about the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker IG Markets quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Round was closed by 0.7 per cent under the new market participants' suspicions about Europe ' s ability to hold a long-term crisis.
"As with the rest of the world, Japan has stopped its view on Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in the direction of rapid change until investors have confirmed that the situation has stabilized," says Mizusige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
This return to the future concerns of the euro area will be in one currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lowest score for half a month.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was $1.3570, dropped by 0.4%.
According to brokers, she fell after the meeting of Angel Merkel HDS Chancellor Party on Monday, which adopted a resolution providing, in particular, the opportunity for the countries in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are significantly higher than 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a high level.
On Tuesday morning, the income of the Italian 10-year-old bonds reached 6.85 per cent and the income of the Spanish bonds reached 6.2 per cent.
These problems with percentage rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to pose a threat to the participants.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, asked for time to restore the situation in Italy under the threat of a paralysing debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papalimos, confirmed that the implementation of decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be "the main task" of his Government.
Spain was exposed to market fires in front of the parliamentary elections on the Wednesday.
A new historical ceiling has been reached between the interest rates of 10-year debt obligations between Germany and Spain.
Expected growth figure in Eurozone
France has increased economic growth by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected by 0.3 per cent, thanks to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, reviewed the decrease in the second quarter, with a fall in 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And economists are particularly concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, has increased by 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first assessment of the whole euro area is expected on 11 a.m., the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over contracts
If there is a subject that cannot be decided after a short discussion or under emotional influence, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing capacity and competitiveness of companies.
This is a healthy trend that election meetings are a cause for reflection on the role and place of nuclear energy.
It will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are examined.
France should build its view on objective facts and rational data.
Now that we have 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic development will draw on itself a double demand for electricity by 2050 if only a large part of the world's population is not lost to vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to meet the growing resource deficit in order to continue electricity production on a constant basis, noting the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalance, which has disappeared from environmental debate.
Fukushima's accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains one in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which decides on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which is intended to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil are just a few of those who are firmly pursuing their projects.
The United States decided after Fukusima to add one installation to its complex by rebuilding the station that was interrupted after the accident at Tri-Mill Island.
Although Germany's model based on renewable energy is sometimes an example, the reality contradicts this argument.
The Berlin elections will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, an increase in energy dependence increased by increased gas import demand, in particular from Russia, a drop in greenhouse gas emissions in connection with the construction of gas and coal stations.
Within a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be felt.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The European Turbine Building Championship, which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is the same as the largest carbon and gas consumption due to over-exploited wind; hence carbon emissions and electricity prices are 65 per cent and 50% higher than in the middle of Europe.
On the other hand, because of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
As the globalised energy price economy is a key factor in competitiveness and the supply of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the most cheap electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will result in a significant increase in the cost of electricity, which will result in lubricating beautiful statements on the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing capacity.
The price that most French refuse to pay is more so because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create industry in 125,000 direct workplaces and 410,000 concentrated.
It is highly export-oriented, attracting the whole range of specialized international trade in small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be transferred to another industry.
If France had decided to give up nuclear energy, it would have to pay more than six billion euros a year from the French export of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical engineer will be ordering EPR to work for 60 years if its manufacturer's closure is planned?
In order to resolve the equation of energy, it should be recognized that there are no divine or demonic sources of energy.
The development of Areva's low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions testifies to the interdependence of energy sources.
The high level of security for nuclear energy is undoubtedly an important issue
In France we have a security body that conducts uncomplicated and transparent control of existing energy centres such as Flamanville.
Our teams, which are generally recognized by professionalism, are full of the same security.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry has had three serious accidents.
Only one, Tri-Mill Island, came under normal conditions of operation, but without any human or environmental impact
In Montenegro, the reactor device and the relentless human error led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that an accident has resulted in two natural disasters of unprecedented force that have resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this disaster, as it did from the two previous generations.
The result of this step and cooperation between security bodies, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project that is capable of countering such events.
As it is considered by all energy specialists who want to build a reactor, its stop in Flamanville will be a great gift for Areva and EDF competitors and will clear their way to lead to the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and legitimate to look for the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, concepts and manoeuvres to be raised in dispute, which is so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a burden or good for the economy?
The immigration policy at Nicola Sarkozy was criticised by various parties - the overload of police, judicial and administrative services subject to digital policies and the compatibility of this policy with France ' s self-proclaimed status as "the State of Human Rights".
Then there was the administrative distress of foreign students who fell into the news when the Minister of Internal Affairs (Libras√≥n of 23 May) said that France "does not need foreign talent, stones and officers".
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The right and the left are very agreeing on this matter.
On the right hand side, Jakom Shirak was asked, which in 1976 stated that "900 000 unemployed will not be a problem in the country with 2 million foreign workers", while on the left side, Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France "cannot take the poor out of the world".
Differences in Gifts Only
In 2005, fear of entry into the territory of the country was felt both left and right by the order of the Polish water carrier.
Both sides see the burden of immigration for the French economy and for the French society.
The difference is only to the level of generosity that they will allow immigrants to show.
In its French programme, the Netherlands has limited its prospects, saying that "co-operation will help solve our immigration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may be of electrical advantage, but it is economically expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffery Cameron remind us in a recent book that published the latest data on immigration (Special people: How migration has shaped our world and will determine our future, May 2011, the publication of Princeton University, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Limitation of immigration leads to a weakening of growth and reduced employment.
The fear of the influence of immigrants is based on the assumption that they are able to replace local workers, especially underqualified workers, by reducing wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants actually do much more than replace local labour force by work that does not fit local labour force.
Unqualified immigrants work in sectors that do not involve local labour force but are the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training is not related to job proposals.
Positive impact on payments
Just as surgery would be difficult to work in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, a complement between local and immigrants, has a positive impact on the wage of local workers.
Jovanni Perry believed that an increase of 1 per cent of migration flows would result in an increase of 0.6-0.9 per cent of real long-term wages.
This is without the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (a large proportion of naturalized immigrants were all founded by Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo).
Migrants are also benefiting from the social security system, with an average of 1 per cent of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labour Organization, for example, an immigrant in Germany has come at the age of 30 years, bringing a net income (debt income) to the government budget for an average of EUR 150,000.
Nicole Sarkozy, at the beginning of her mandate, was about to enter the areas where there was no growth.
Those teeth that were used to scare immigrants were at least counterproductive.
Europe has chosen democracy, the European democracy remains to be understood
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but it is also fragile.
The European continent must remember that, more than two thousand years ago, it had survived the tragedy of World War I, the totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gouga, and Franco in Spain, the Salazar in Portugal and the Colonels in Greece.
Some believed that democracy would ultimately turn itself against its enemies, enough to hold the vote and make it as direct as possible.
From the time of Napoleon "Malago" it is known that this is from the surface of the mind.
The general vote, although it is a mandatory condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can even be a ‚Äúpressure instrument‚Äù, as the philosopher Etan Vashro once said.
No, democracy requires much more public space, public spirit, values, organization, division and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but firstly it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the true and false Greek referendum will have a double disbursement effect, demonstrating the need for a serious change in policy and its incompetence.
This duality needs to be understood in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the fight against democracy has now emerged, and many believe that Republican soldiers are now not on that side.
We don't win anything by requiring a series of national referendums organized on the scale of fate and in the aesthetic order.
"Cart-Blanch" for an absolute European monarch or a legged in the loss of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not think of lescisity of glutin, but of implementation - joint, clear and continuous - elections and democracy, at this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and there is no known number of them, since there is only one crisis in Europe.
All of Europe is subject to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
All of Europe is undermining at an international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of Europe's sovereignty, but all of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, along with all its nations.
The management of the European project should be restored rapidly under the rule of national sovereignty.
Because Europeans can only work together to reduce the burden of each one's debt, get rid of the markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at the general European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, without causing us disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal by the Socialists and Jack Delor, the European Economic Government is still required.
Let's do it.
But to imagine herself without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration, which is going on in the life of a citizen, is an ordinary nonsense and a new dumbass.
We have to start a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, the Republicans had to "get" them.
The revolution of interests would be insufficient.
This lesson is still in force.
We must build a single Europe at the economic level.
This can only be done through the establishment of a more democratic Europe at the political level of this people's European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
Unaccompanied chips are being spread all over the world.
The World Chip Map exhibition is opened on Tuesday in Wilpente, under Paris, in the atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 11 per cent of world sales of microprocessors (bank cards, SIM cards) will end in 2011, above Eurosmart, according to some 6,000 million units.
The most important non-contact technology sector that enables public transport or purchases to simply carry out a credit card.
In this year, 460 million uncontacted chip cards will be sold in the world against 320 million years ago!
Their share will grow in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and will account for nearly 10 per cent of the world's chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has been away from the Asia-Pacific region for a long time, is now moving forward in the field of non-contact payments.
Some 26 million VISA bank cards have already been provided with this function and are received by 75,000 terminals.
France is starting with a more modest position: 400,000 non-contact visas are being dealt with.
But large shops are increasing.
This year, Carrefour released 2.5 million missing Pass MasterCard.
In order to get to a higher speed, banks need to provide their customers with equipment.
‚ÄúTwo large organizations in France have promised to regularly distribute bank cards to their customers for non-contact use in the future,‚Äù said Jerar Nebui, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments using a mobile phone.
But it's just the first phase of future payment, it's a mobile phone.
Only a few devices are equipped with the NFC (NFC) technology needed to carry out such transactions.
"They were delayed.
"But they must now be released next year."
"We are counting on world sales from 80 to 120 million units in 2012, explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are coming forward.
Yesterday, Cr√©dit Agricole announced an experiment from December to June of the following year in Cana.
The iPhone equipment will provide some 200 clients and staff with check-ins.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Soci√©t√© Generale also stated yesterday that it would prepare a market for a proposal that would allow its customers to pay via mobile phones.
The terrorist front is extended from Sakhari to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
A long-standing link between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sector has been established.
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messachel, even stated that Algerians are now convinced of this.
"The way these two organizations use it and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating," he explained, not in detail.
Paris seems to have reached similar conclusions.
The investigation of two French kidnappings in Nigeria in January revealed two related calls.
The people kidnapped at the Niam√© restaurant near Aqmi, Antuan de Leokur and Vensan Delori were apparently killed the following day, along with several of the claimants during the operation by the French Special Forces.
Among the remains of the camps after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several phone-cards belonging to terrorists.
Here's the terror.
A number of participants in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria were interviewed.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one refers to a Nigerian who lived long in Maydigure, the city in northern Nigeria, the Boko Haram, and the other, to a human being, who is said to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but there is no doubt that there must be more reliable evidence than that of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But that's possible."
‚ÄúIt has been known for years that the sect has received financial and ideal support outside and that it has become increasingly active,‚Äù says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuvo.
In recent months this support has become more and more evident by the actions and statements of Boko Haram and by its methods, which now include the use of dead and increasingly complex explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community, in its head with Washington, is now under pressure from Abuja to focus on the problems created by Boko Haram.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities traditionally viewed this group as a community of educated people who are not interested.
The Best Success
Based in 2002 in Maydigure at a meeting, school and a fundamentalist in Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means " Western education is sin" in the House - preachs the establishment of the Islamic Empire in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has made rapid progress.
It is politically and requires strict respect for the charismatic, and its activists have begun to fight against the ill-treatment of the central government.
It is primarily aimed at churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, activists Boko Haram were particularly active, carrying out numerous attacks on police offices.
Aborigine's reaction, as usual, is uncomplicated.
The army blocked the city and left behind 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, who was taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radically and will cross the border of its northern tribes.
In her last birthday, she was responsible for an action that killed 80 people in Jose and then another in Abuja.
In June in Abuja Boko Haram organized the first death attack on the police headquarters.
In August the United Nations local representation will become their first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist zone in Africa, which comes from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now concerned by all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi has been strengthened in Mali and Niger and Somalis from al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram presents a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a meeting with Presidents Gudlak Jonathan Allen Juppe warned of the dangers of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all the information available.
Peace as seen by Republican candidates in presidential
With respect to China, Iran and Israel's assistance, Mitt Romni, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are faced with simplification and incompetence.
Can America‚Äôs crisis make it difficult for it to find a calmer world with simple, more accurate ideas?
If candidates were to be listened to by the presidents of the Republicans, the voters could believe in that.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been a bit of a big but missing detail of the foreign policy statement, which is traditionally a strong side of the republicans.
The settlements of China, Iran and Israel are often mixed with one another.
Mitt Romni, whose best chances of moving from the Old Good Party, threatened to petition the Chinese in the WTO and accuse them of ‚Äúmanipulating their currency ‚Äì a sensitive issue for America, reflected by the migration of all industries in Asia.
It's worse if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, an former Ambassador of Obama to China and the only candidate who understood the complex foreign policy, was unable to challenge the emotional situation.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (now Obama).
But Huntsman, who lives in the lower part of the ratings, remains unheard of.
In Regan's style
The Romans also promised military attacks on Iran if sanctions could not stop its nuclear programme.
"If you choose me, I'll stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is reelected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen Israel ' s military assistance by accusing Obama of failing to fulfil the promises relating to this partner.
Herman Cain, the second candidate in the ranking of candidates, demonstrated a disturbing lack of knowledge.
He recently called on the Chinese military threat because Beijing was trying to gain nuclear power - obviously not knowing that China had it since 1964!
Governor Texas Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military attacks on Iran, says he is ready to use the American army in Mexico against drug users.
It is also recommended that Cain, Perry and candidate Michel Bahman avoid the suffering of suspected terrorist attacks prohibited by Obama in 2009.
All of this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, heavy foreign policy.
The current President's opponents replied that Reygan also had simple ideas and that he had won a cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to lower his ton of counter-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the pre-eminent "fish" conclusion from Iraq, his catches in Libya, which brought him a reputation for weak policies.
But it's not that simple.
The population considered the national security balance of Obama, which had eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military intervention that joins the sand.
And, asserting that America needs to be rehabilitated in order to regain its leadership, Obama's rights.
North Stream, new ports for Russian gas entry into Europe.
The pipeline of North-West Europe and Russia, directly at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has been launched.
It is estimated to provide gas equivalent to 30 million households.
The Russian giant gas producer wanted to clear this off with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, participated on the Baltic coast last Tuesday, between the speech of the orchestra and the sought breakfasts, in the opening of the North Stream, of a new gas pipeline that directly unites Russia and Germany under water.
The German Chancellor Angel Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister France Fion and his Dutch colleague, Mart Rutte, brought back together a symbolic valve controlling Russian gas generation into the Western European network.
According to the new gas pipeline, 27.5 million additional cubic metres of gas will be available each year in Western Europe on the first pipeline of 1,224 km, which connects the Leningrad region with the lands of Meklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline must be ready by the end of 2012, providing a total supply of 55 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to the total consumption of France.
The possibility of building a third pipeline on the same path is already under discussion.
The timely completion of this huge project for the Gazprom is a victory.
The project met with severe opposition from Poland and the Pribaltian States.
The North River will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding the passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries lose part of their power, making it more difficult for them to influence Russia, threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the most pressing moment of Warsaw's debate, the North Stream had not ceased to be compared with the new German-Soviet Treaty, with a view to establishing a Union between Hitler and Stalin with a view to occupying Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
With the support of the Russian project, Western Europe is gaining greater security of supply.
But Europe's cost of energy is high because the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia has been able to gain more than five years ' understanding of the direct union between Russia and rich Western countries that are already consuming large amounts of gas and whose own stocks are already in the background.
"This gas pipeline is part of Russia's cooperation, it is a new artery that binds us organically," said France Fion, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent major gas contracts are important and politically and economically.
All of this explains the wide gap between the heads of Gasprom, who were in large numbers in Lubmin, the point of arrival of gas.
The armament of this gas pipeline is also a technical step.
The pipeline is made of steel trapped in concrete in order to protect it from the cocoons of ships.
It lies on the seabed, on the average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, mine fields remained in the second world war.
"The percentage had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Muller, a North Stream press secretary.
There was also a need to take a lot of steps to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metallic snake with a weight equal to 242 Ephele basons, with no break across it, no valves and no service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers rejected it because Sweden was not in the second place that the Russian public company would always move to its borders.
"In the event of an accident, we're crossing the gas stream less than a minute," says Jens Muller.
So in the case of running gas contained in the gas pipeline, it goes into the air.
However, this seems to be a small-scale design that has designed only one 100,000 years of progress.
Gas flow control will be carried out by a sub-route robot that holds the ship for external observation and by a vehicle that circles within the gas flow.
The smoker is inserted in the tube tube diameter 1 metre and penetrates before the gas flow.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second, it shall provide accurate information on any metal deformation.
The gas pipeline has been designed for work for 50 years without the need for smaller repairs.
The gas circulation is carried out only through its pressure.
It consists of 200 bar at departure and 100 bar at arrival.
Five companies have combined efforts to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51 per cent of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent each), the Dutch Gasunia and the French Group GDF Suez (9 per cent).
The five companies established a joint venture called the North Stream, which was commissioned to build and operate the gas pipeline.
Its headquarters is located in Cugue, Switzerland, where tax is particularly favourable.
After that, Gazprom gave the company a lease for 20 years with the possibility of extending the total amount of gas transport.
"Gasporm will be paid in full regardless of the amount of gas that will actually be transported," says Jens Muller.
Financing of gas pipeline construction was provided by 30% of shareholders and 70% of bank loans.
The total cost of work is EUR 7.4 billion for two pipelines.
GDF Suez's investments will be around 240 million.
But minority shareholders are convinced that they will earn their expenses because the Gasprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy shores of the forest.
The valves are 4,5 meters high, forming the exhaust outlet.
The sensors measure pressure, temperature and specific gas characteristics before moving it into German gas pipelines.
Since Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
It will total 3 million in time and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine Brand Block
Moleskine, created by the Italian company 15 years ago, will taste the letter.
He's got a aroma of endings, times of writing at the light of the candle.
The Moleskine block is easy to find out about the direct black surface, on the line, on the yellow-white pages, which you want with time.
However, the book Moleskine, which we know today, was born in 1997.
The Italian Modo Modo company in Milan decided to launch design blocks.
Maria Sebregondi, then company consultant, took responsibility for starting a new product.
The block is inspired by an old manufacturing technique, a mollusc - lactated boyish cloth used, for example, to cover shoes.
This type of blockade is confirmed to be highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has brought in line with today's old and forgotten thing that was cultural to the Avangardists by the 20th century," said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leader brand in Modo Mode.
Good luck.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25 per cent and reached 12.7 million.
We were far from producing the first years when there were 3,000 blocks.
Moleskine crossed the border of Italy and exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
Set the typical buyer's profile is difficult because the blockade is equally attractive to businessmen, students and free professions.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitical, they have wide views and education.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 staff members, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and one in New York.
It spread its blocks in Fnac's bookstores, shops in the center of small towns, and was able to obtain extensive knowledge.
‚ÄúWe have followed the spirit of time and this new need in writing despite the appearance of e-mails,‚Äù explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural painting is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; recently the brand organized the "Environment Road" exhibition where architects and artists demonstrated their own blocks.
In August he also launched a leopard drawing on the case of filmmaking in Locarno.
Using its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has differentiated its products that now include bags, hands, bags for computers. Brand includes all kinds of support.
The success that was born depends on how Modo Modo was purchased by the SG Capital Europe investment fund in August 2006 and is now Syntegra Capital, which has written a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is unemployment among disabled workers so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
The 15th week of disability work begins today.
Despite public welfare policy, the proportion of unemployment among persons with disabilities in 2005 is still twice the average, i.e. 19 per cent against 9 per cent for the general population.
He's worried?
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù stressed Eric Blanche, Director General Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of disability employment.‚Äù
"In 15 years, significant progress will be made."
"At that time, the percentage of unemployed was not 2 but 3 times more."
"Then there's a lot more work to do."
It must be said that there is still much to be said about disability at work.
Among them are older: 37 per cent older than 50 (17 per cent on average).
They have a lower level of qualification: 80 per cent do not have bacalavre, and only 10 000 persons with disabilities are among the 2.3 million students in higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread, which is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities against 38 per cent of the average.
In addition, all these criteria, which are very difficult to return to work and which are a problem,‚Äù said Christian Grappen, Director General Tremplin, association established in 1992 to help companies hire persons with disabilities.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about mentality that changes but is too slow.
A study conducted in April by IMS-Entreprenere under Cit√© showed that the managers interviewed had a low level of knowledge of disability and "presented themselves as common people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally incomplete".
The result is private companies with more than 20 employees still far from the goal of having 6 per cent of persons with disabilities under the Act adopted in 1987.
The latest figures for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
"We are about 3 per cent today," says Pierre Blan, Director General Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of ‚Äútaxable‚Äù organizations, as well as the amounts paid, fell from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations in 2007-2011 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which imposed tax, created a strong pressure on the company, explains Pierre Blan."
"But this improvement also reflects increased awareness, in particular, of large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of employees from 20 to 49 are employed against 82 per cent of workers from 100 to 199.
Azar: "Good luck."
Before meeting with the Synims on Tuesday (20.45 p.m.) Adam Asar and George Leeness did not hide the satisfaction they had received from this friendly match.
We're not here to argue that there was a secret conversation between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Situated on the outskirts of the Stade de France, George Leeness and Eden Azar died.
Five months after his attack on Turkey, the Belgian trainer could only praise him.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, his movement and the fact that he's a Belgian."
"I want to go further," believes Lille's game.
What's the difference between his achievements in the club and the club, that's one whole, he's right.
"I'm in Lille for a year, not in Belgium."
"I have to work my eyes."
In front of this fight with France, in the game against Romania on Friday night, Asar came to St.
I don't forget, however, about the concept of "satisfying."
He supported children from 7 years of age and won campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always supported them, he says.
This, of course, also strengthens the particular character of this match.
On the other hand, there are (other) Mothers, John, and Adil."
"Our roads have just crossed."
"The chance to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leenness kindly reminded me of pride.
"Hungry" to play in "an empty match."
Pride also claims to be "neighbourly" that France "has become a very high-level team" all year after the trauma in Naizna.
"Loran Blan was like a hit by a hole, he wakes up.
Now, when Belgium misses the next Euro, a technical athlete will fly into a plane with children... in Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing up," he stressed.
"We're building something, the games are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will be convinced of this in future matches, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident in itself
Portugal, Paul Bentu, begins its fight against Bosnia (22.00 p.m.) on this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On his way to him, both of his teams, it was said, lost a sense of reality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paul Bentu has already seen himself in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt in his mind that the Assembly, in its role as of September 2010, is qualified for the euro 2012.
Portugal is all 90 minutes lucky.
But there's a fight to play, and Bosnia has to win.
With 0 to 0 on Friday in the garden of Zenica, it's clear that the game isn't over.
Although Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, it was unable to achieve the promised goal that would calm it.
"It's a good result, however, which will take a certain risk."
But in its bright enlightened stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will go to the public in front of the public which should be on Tuesday, although the match will be very intense," said the optimistic but dissuasive Bent.
"We expect a very tight fight, but we are convinced that we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% of the opportunities for the euro 2012," said translator Carlos Keiros.
Nothing in the fight against Bosnia on Friday requires the Portuguese to win.
There's nothing I can do to build the bushes.
"It's a good result, however, of some risk, is Bento's regret.
"We will play against a team with a lot of technical values and a lot of individual values," he added.
As was already in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on Bosnians from the very beginning, "don't give them time to think."
That's a good idea. It'd only be realistic this time.
