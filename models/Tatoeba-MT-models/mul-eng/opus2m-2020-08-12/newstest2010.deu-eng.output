Barack Obama receives the fourth US President's Peace Nobel Prize
US President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours to avoid the price of peace in history as the fourth US President.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medals and a check over $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House will meet with his wife Michelle in the Nordic Metropolis tomorrow and will be busy all the time.
First, he makes a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five members of the Committee who have chosen him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The presidential couple then arranged a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V. and King Sonja.
The next afternoon, the visit will reach its peak with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the prize price.
This is received as the fourth President of the United States, but only as the third one who takes the price directly from the office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will be talking about the Afghan war when the price is taken over.
The President does not want to ignore this issue because he knows that he is taking over the price as a president leading to war in two countries at the time of the war.
He has strengthened the efforts of war a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which no one of his critics has forgotten to mention.
At the ceremony Obama also received the gold medals, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish kroner (about 24 million Czech kroner).
He intends to spend money for well-being, but he has not yet decided on a specific charity work.
The event programme will then provide for a banquet with the president and his wife, where the Prime Minister and 250 other guests will also be present outside Norway's King and Queen.
From the start, Obama was very back against the price.
For example, he pointed out that he felt that he did not deserve the price.
Many times he also repeated that it is not only about the price for him but also about all those who want the same values as he wants.
Immediately after the announcement, he pointed out that this is "requirement for action".
Natural protection is charged with repression
The Leitmeritz Police accused the presidents of the Civil Protection Community Leitmeritz because of pressure.
In several cases, in the last year he introduced professions against certain construction procedures, and for the return of his professions he asked for money from the investors for his welfare, said the chief of police, Alena Romova.
Mr Lubomir Studnicka, President of the Leitmeritz-Naturschührtzschückenschaft.
Now he's in custody and it gives him a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sortie mill container in brünn doesn't smell good
In Prague people can sort out the drinking packages, in the South Sea resorts you can find the sortier-müllcontainer step-by-step.
And in Brünn?
There you had to book a few minutes to find the right Mülltons.
I do not want to argue that the waste disposal in Brün would not work at all.
But I am wondering whether the refugees are not concerned enough about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brünn is in the waste divides in the Urwaldlaga, not only because we as citizens can always supply only paper, glass and plastics in the variety containers, but especially through the Müllton numbers for such waste.
Have they ever tried to take out PET bottles in a collection bag, for example?
It's just art, above all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I've found accidentally so far is the mermaid place against the trapped gangs.
Mr. Underka's colleagues should not be proud of us, but I think that's too little.
In addition to the fact that the waste disposal is also not genuine in other parts.
All of my friends' ranks are therefore not even about to sort out the waste.
From Faulheit.
It's too far for them to go to the Mülltons.
I don't like it.
I offered myself after the festival to take care of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova street, I have seen no color mullets in my eyes.
Fortunately, I got to the right place on the road.
But the müll liked it almost over.
But that's still the center of Brünn, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetic are likely to call the socialists brünner.
They prefer to buy the city an Eishockeylagi, which makes us worse in the whole Republic, instead of buying a few milltons more and offering more raw materials for a clean fuel.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics after I have been looking for a long time on the Internet.
According to the data of the company ECO-COM, Brünn is really the worst in the whole area of South America.
The Paroubek budget has withdrawn the money for rents and sickness money
After the left-wing party, despite the government's view of farmers and officials, no money is available in the budget for rents, sickness money and construction business.
But not for state officials or for the international court.
This causes more problems that will be at government in the second half of the next year, says Finance Minister Edward Janato.
When the social Democrats and Communists have implemented the increase in debt for some groups, they calculated that the government is spending money in addition to the emotional expenditure, ageing or for the sick money. "This is just a solution to the problems in the future, minimizing," says Janata.
Credits are usually paid with higher interest rates, and money needs to be restored at some point.
Too much to choose, where to take the state case is empty.
If the social benefits or costs are not reduced for the state operation, the tax must be increased.
For all those who had the left party more money now: the fire weapon, the teachers, the farmers.
And later on for her children.
In order for the rents or the sickness money that has disappeared from their account 1.8 billion people need no fear, they will get this money.
But for the price that the State owes itself even more - in the coming year, it will not only be lost 163 billion in the State case but far more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janato, the debt will increase as quickly as possible and with this too costs and benefits.
The state will need the money for the balance, then it will no longer be sufficient to raise VAT only slightly or to reduce maternity money, as the government did in its self-deficiency package.
As a result of money laundering in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing in next year for the construction of the roads and railways.
It is mainly about the sections won in the competition which cannot be redesigned and possibly validated.
Get at least what's not free.
This means the delay or the setting up of thirty large construction works, which is also at risk of European money creation, warns the speaker of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it resolves the flow of money in Solomonic - it will address the CEZ activists in which the State is the owner of the majority and will then protect the money in the transport fund.
The problem is that the height of the dividends is never safe and it is not an endless source.
In the last year, CEZ spent 18 billion dollars on the budget.
Each year, the dividends pay environmental damage relief, the pension account is filled and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trend also increases the actual budget deficit at the level of 5.7% of GDP according to EU rules.
However, this does not end the carnival of conversions.
Nearly three billion fell the budget for various damages to victims of communism and punishments or for the use of justice, even for the construction of buildings.
If the state comes without this money, it's not safe.
That's a good luck game.
If we lose an international court, then we have to pay this as well, Janato makes it clear.
The Minister will then have to save the money in the resources or, worse still, attack the government budget reserves.
Hundreds of millions are also missing for the two-billion-dollar state-of-the-art project that will allow on-line monitoring of what the individual authorities spend on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would come in this case, warned Janato.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans calculate for the future with a phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single key.
The proposed plans look promising.
It's enough to press only one key, and from Windows Mobile it will be in a few seconds in the Android exchange.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to present, which focuses in particular on the development of virtual software for the computer.
We allow you to run two users profiles on the phone at the same time.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work parallelly, stated Srinivas Krishnamurti by VMware at the interview for the computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was first introduced a few days ago.
On the market it will come in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, on which the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems survived at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full practice.
The VMware company is now working with European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and should come to the customer within 2012.
Snowfall on the mountains serves the hotel owners
SSNEELSE PISTERS Don't worry about just the people of the rain mountain.
The missing snow also attracts people from ordering skiing in hotels and pensions.
That is why you can still get free rooms in Riegenge Mountains for all winter terms including Christmas and Easter.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, fix the prices, but among them they have fear of order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether our opinion is going to be on snow this year's Christmas Eve or "at Mass", the operator of the Information Sports Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura.
If you want the Silver-Silvester stand in the spindle, you should not hesitate with the order any more.
Whoever prefers saving and comes to second place only when the quality of the stay can try and wait a few days.
The owner of the spindelmüh hotel offers mostly weekly accommodation for the Silver Day.
I think they'll try to sell them for a while, but then they'll have to follow up, and they'll have to go in for a little while.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, dear Jandura.
Free Beds at all winter temperatures also always offer the Travel Office Intours in Vrchlabi.
Now most of us are interested in the Christmas week that is not yet sold.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some more cost-effective Christmas entertainment for the last moment, led by the director of the Travel Office Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Silvester Day in Riegengberge can also offer the Vrchlabi travel office, but there are less free places here.
Good paragraph also finds the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter periods are averaged.
In this year's interest in winter content is also negatively affected by the fact that there is no snow in Riegeng mountains.
People wait for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the year in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks are broken within a week, the Christmas will also be sold, i.e. skiing.
Turned around and something better than last year, it is possible to own the rooms in the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We're about five percent better than last year.
On Wednesday and Christmas we have just a few free rooms.
There is great interest in Polish holidays in January, and in February the business will run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also located at Janske Lazne in the central park.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain free at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
In January of this year, we were surprised to see about 60 percent of us already employed.
A bit weaker is between February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in the rest of the Riegeng Mountains is also increasing, led by the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
On a larger snow cover, the Riegongberge hotel owners are waiting.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it comes down, it should be snowed on the mountains.
But then a reheat will come, reported Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech Weather Agency in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Rehabilitation is the mother of loneliness
It is almost comical, with which students Barack Obama, the president, with his call from the Kügsten, repeats his previous strategy in the Afghan question which he himself considered to be the dumbest.
When he finally resigned his highly expected Afghan doctorate, it turned out that he wrote this about the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario for three years.
Not only that he used the word type "as in Iraq" in the text several times, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward" without hurting.
Even three years ago, he criticized the Bush idea - fresh troop contingents in Iraq, which was imposed by the civil war - as "independable and in their consequences" as a "carastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy of the military's recommendations was the only possible and, therefore, very successful that today there is no longer talk in the news about Iraq.
The call Bush was not improved by this, as he objectively left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will continue.
To raise the troops' quota, the military again asked him, in particular the Chief of the Afghan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordination practices, strongly criticised the harmful protections in the White House.
He asked 40,000 soldiers to turn the situation into a better one.
The President has spent three months, but he has not come up with a better idea, and thus he has committed 10,000 soldiers to the general needs.
From Europe, he has made a commitment to another 5,000, even if he himself originally counted at least 10,000.
The biggest problem with the entire Obama strategy is its intention to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and to end this process within three years. The entire Obama doctorate leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that half-exceeding will have the same effect as the measures in Iraq.
Despite the last few years' fraternal war, the Iraqi society has been well structured and its leaders respect the values.
The Afghan situation is covered by the counter-indication - no one can leave and no agreements will be held.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces who are accustomed to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even if they have been formally founded, remain only radio structures, which will further increase the patriarchal tribal relations.
The difference of interest between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the inconsistencies of the conditions which further complicate the influence of Pakistan and Iran.
It is also very unrealistic to build a "trading State", which is the minimalist objective of the entire operation.
Time horizon of the Obama strategy promoted by its volunteerism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and is now at the edge of the explosion.
They believe that the small soldiers who have been thrown into the war series about "Morning Home," here create a miracle, can only create a really romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date set for the withdrawal of troops is a clear liability because the Taliban will be taken as the indirect attitude of the US Netherlands.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan goes hand in hand.
European politicians can and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu Mountains.
Another possible factor that can affect the situation radically is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on Iran are not effective, a very serious question for the United States is whether the problem is not resolved by troops.
This question must be answered in the period during which Obama appealed to the United States for victory from Afghanistan.
However, each solution will also mean a dramatic application of the Afghan situation.
The only trusted bottle for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years to the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time for him to take on another strategy if he would prove to be a total failure.
The bank manager Goldman Sachs no longer receives a premium bonus in bar
The leading leadership forces of the U.S. Goldman Sachs Bank will no longer receive premium bonus this year.
This has been announced by the company that has responded to the harsh criticism of its pay practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives instead of the money shares that can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from the managers in the case if they act too risky.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters Agency, is at the top of the efforts to connect the premioboni of the Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the ongoing direction in which it has to go, led by the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after she had spent nearly $17 billion for the first three quarters of this year for premium bonus.
The total amount of the premium bonus over this year will probably be exceeded by the Reuters Agency despite today's measure of 20 billion dollars.
The high premiums in the banking sector have become the most political issue since the start of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
The United Kingdom reported on Wednesday that it is intended to charge the banker's boni, which exceeds 25,000 pounds, once a tax of 50 per cent.
France is preparing for similar steps.
In this year women have won the Nobel Prize in all directions, except in physics.
Five record women in Stockholm today have from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustav took this year's Nobel Prizes into professional categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has been awarded by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their Landsmann Jack Szostak for research in the chromosone field.
The price for chemistry has been received by the Israeli Ada Jonathan along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, to clarify the structure and function of the ribosom.
The last Laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics received by American Elinor Ostrom and her Landsmann Oliver Williamson for analysis of the economic report.
The only professional category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today scientists Charles Kao for research in the glass phaser area and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the discovery of CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical remote systems.
Each of these clerics has received the diplomas, Nobel medals and certificates on the acquisition of the monetary price.
Each category has ten million Swedish kroner.
If there are several prize winners in each category, the money price will be divided below them.
In accordance with tradition, US President Barak Obama has received the expected peace Nobel Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the contradiction of his appointment because he was only at the beginning of his journey, and is also at the top of the country, which leads two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the fight against world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janato is considering his return. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives the Minister of Finance, Edward Janata, who is thinking about his stay in the government on Friday, because he is not in agreement with the implementation of the government budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Chamber on Wednesday.
It is accepted that the budget and perhaps the stay of Janato in the cabinet will be the subject of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The President-in-Office, Radim Ochvat, informed us about the meeting.
Janato wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budgetary law now granted to Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should have a deficit of 163 billion dollars.
In Parliament, however, on Wednesday, the Left-Parties proposals for money-laundering were agreed and the money was increased for state officials, for the maintenance of social services and for the direct loans of farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of social democracy that it is covering the budget deficit.
The left-wing party on the one hand and the government, the class and the legal party on the other, has therefore created a sharp internal political dispute and therefore raises questions about the further work of the Fisher Office, which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have joined in the morning.
Critics argued that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, effectively liquidated the package of savings that were implemented by the fisheries government in autumn and should end the debt of the state after their understanding.
Klaus, who could sign the law on the state budget, but he did not have to say today at the morning of the debate with the entrepreneurs that the politicians have long been behind the "incessant problem", the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a wider consensus of the political parties.
ODS President Mirek Toplanek pointed out that the budget is generous and that the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS Vice-President, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the Office, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party, is obviously no longer functioning.
Premier Fischer referred to similar words as "strong challenges".
The head of the CSSD, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the Etat Deficit was gross that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year and exceeded the 200 billion dollars.
Already Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claimed that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Uncivilized" of the world shows much from the country, despite its struggle and victory despite some criticisms that the main role was played by an American actor.
The story is about sports, race relations and about Nelson Mandela.
The innocent fight against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is presented in his life story by the American Oscar-schauler, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the one-hundred-year-old Mandela if he could show him in the Eastwood film.
Another significant role is that of Matt Damon.
I said to him: "When I play you, I have to meet you.
The two-year-old actor who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the "Million Dollar Baby" box, already represented the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which he has become a slave holder, a firm president of the United States, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but only rarely someone who lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic for 27 years.
He was set free in 1990, and for four years he was president of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "undefiled", and at the same time is the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film describes a real event in which Nelson Mandela has his forces with the head of the South African Red Cross team, Francois Pienaar, together to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people are still divided according to apartheid as well as economically.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the football players that belong to the outside world.
Finally, the South African team rises to the world Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked several years ago to bring Mandela's story to the Kinolein walls.
He had no other goal than to play this role as close as possible to it as possible, Freeman said.
The greatest challenge was of course to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela to eat with him at night and be behind the scenes before his talk.
The most important thing was for him to protect Mandela's hand.
I've found that if I'm protecting your hand, I take your energy, she'll be transferred, and I've had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
It's important for me to be another person.
Matt Damon is the head of the national football team in which the white players have examined the film François Pienaar.
The actor said he had six months' time to prepare for the role in the hard Rugbywelt.
It was a great surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I heard the Turklingel saying that he opened up and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: 'In the film I look much larger'.
Despite the obvious differences in the role of players in comparison with their real models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of Director Eastwood "Invictus: Unhappily" and is also speaking of views on an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety page, Todd McCarthy, concluded his evaluation in the following words: "That was a very good story, very good film."
In the film reviews on the website redtomatoes.com, Invictus received 76% positive reviews.
Light Secret About Norway: The Russians have tested a rocket
A special light effect was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence recently announced that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the start was not successful again and the rocket named "Bulava" that was supposed to be originally the seat of the Russian army will gradually become the capital of the Russian generality as well as the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
Also his repeated presence in the rocket test had no positive effect on the success of the pilots.
Bulava has not been started at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers it is already written about "Bulava" as about "Rakete that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This is already 13. Try, it's normal at first.
However, technical damage to the rockets were reported only at the end of the flight.
The engine probably exploded in the third level of rocket.
This time, "Bulava" began from the atom-U-boat Dmitrij Donskij, which flowed under the water of the White Sea.
This rocket type enables the crew from the U-boat.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an uncertain flying object over Norway was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, since the first moment, the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian rocket.
On this occasion, the generality has maintained itself and claimed that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two levels of rockets didn't fall out and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases the engines were equally damaged at the first level.
Even if no test start has been made without error, only six out of thirty success will be achieved under the leadership of the Ministry of Defence.
The almost fifty percent success is therefore achieved with optimism, and it is further claimed that the "Bulava" will once fly without problems and even 10 hypershell atomic head heads will be carried with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow with 51 years of age.
The legendary reverse player Vjaceslav Fetisov is once again presented with 51 years in a professional Eishockey game.
The former world master, Olympics and Stanley Cup -owner is helping his team CSKA Moscow in need, and it is likely already in the KHL Friday duel against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career in 1998, is currently President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify some other formalities, the AP Agency quoted the coach of the Moscow Club by Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous Eishockey player is concerned with just one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can add to the moral of other players, a player named Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back on the ice surface, he will follow the AP of the oldest Russian professional icecockkey game.
In the NHL, the legendary Stürmer Gordie Howe has played a whole season for Hartford for fifteen years and was able to write 15 hits and 26 assistants.
The oldest five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful icekey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven World Championships and also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in Junior World Championships.
In the second part of his career he also collected success in the NHL, where he twice won the Stanley Cup over the head in Detroit.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Eishockey Star Room.
Hyundai followed the trades. All over the hours are up
The business management of the Nosovice Automotive Factory Hyundai agreed with the cooperation on the suspension of all over-hours.
Because of frequently scheduled overtime, the company announced the strike preparation on Monday.
This was confirmed by the speaker of the car factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
However, the business management wants to share with the trade unions more than a Saturday day this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime was proposed on the ground that two work stories would be worked out, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company has offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work on Saturdays.
The staff will also receive it in the vicinity of the Saturday of 28 November.
Vanek therefore decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
In either case, they may pay the over-hour penalty or may take replacement leave on 28 December and thus extend the Christmas holiday, Vanek brought up.
In addition, all employees of the Saturdays will be paid the ride money and lunches.
In view of the fact that the overhours of the most urgent and burning point were the demands and complaints of the trade unions which had established the production last week, Vanék decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the suspension of all overhours for the month of December.
The car factory staff were forced to work almost every day until the last week, almost 2 hours after the eight-hour schedule.
From the signing of the Agreement, the line preparation shall be withdrawn from the trade unions.
Further negotiations between the driving of the car factory and the trade unions should take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that, if they agree to meet the requirements and can sign a joint document, they would be ready to raise the strike.
The situation in the car factory has increased last week, on the Wednesday, as about 400 employees spontanely stretched for constant hours.
They also protested against the bad pay conditions and alleged skis.
However, the business management held that employees had to make time for the maintenance of the car supply requirement.
The workers also requested that no sanctions should be imposed on employees who had interrupted the production on the previous Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the companies require that overtime work be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, they demand the payment of 5000 kroner this year.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The series production was started in the company in November last year.
Up to this September, some 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, with current manufacturing capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in the case of HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new connections that should link the spread of HIV viruses into the organism.
The main benefit of the improved substance is that it also works in the viruses that are already resistant to medicines.
This is because of the fact that the association with normal virus variants does not affect as much as one of the medicines already available.
The disease can't be healed yet.
Patients may be able to prolong their life and prevent the increase in HIV virus in the body.
However, its intake is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
In addition, insufficient stress on the virus increase has resulted in the development of sg. resistance virus, which is no longer effective against the medicinal products.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way for interfering with the virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances referred to as metalocarbons affect the protein responsible for the increase in HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are compounds of Bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These connections block the virus infection in other ways than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists have obtained new 'improvement' links that were prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the protein.
The metalocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multidimensional boilers consisting of carbon, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Domestic and persistent virus
HIV-protease is an ingredient of HIV-virus, which is indispensable for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus column caused by HIV protease, no advanced HIV particles would arise.
If we turn off the HIV protease, we also disable the increase in the virus in the patient's body, explain the scientists in the press report published by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe the entire series of connections in which two pairs of cages (see tables) are connected by a short organic chain that is then systematically modified.
Something weaker but more reliable
The effect of this range of substances on HIV protease has been tested in Reagenzglass, as well as its remaining (resistant) variants that have been obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarbons on the normal enzyme variant is not as strong as those used in clinical medicinal products, but does not lose its effect on the resistance variants against which the medicines used are often without effect.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its other characteristics, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical design, makes metalocarbons interesting links to the development of more effective anti-HIV drugs research, says Pavlina Rezacova, director of the laboratory for structural biology of institutions for organic chemistry and biochemistry and of the Institute for molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fight for Budget. ODS went off to Fischer, who's fighting.
The president of ODS, Mirek Topolanek, appointed the approved budget for the next year as "grayful" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its further existence.
The adoption of the ODS was designated by the Prime Minister as a "strong challenge".
It may be time for the analysis.
The vice-president of ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the office, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party, is obviously no longer working.
After Necas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he intends to support the minority in Parliament when it comes to fighting the growing deficit or whether he is going to stay in the office with Parliament’s links.
The rise of ODS and social Democrats to the problems of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
The Parliament adopted the budget for 2010 on Wednesday, however, with proposals for left-wing amendments over more than 12 billion euros.
Parliament has increased the money for state officials, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of social democracy to raise budget deficits.
Chechnya should have a discount of 163 billion dollars.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so she has followed the government's wish, because the modified budget is only a minor version of the budget forecast. Frase not clear
Disillusionment and unconsciousness
Minister of Finance, Edward Janata, has spoken about his disappointment and a sense of worthlessness, which Prime Minister Jan Fischer has pointed out that the government is still considering the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janato had seriously threatened with his return to the case, the amendments would have been adopted, the situation would have looked different.
According to the Czech TV, Janata reported for Monday after the government business at the Premier.
In this connection, he indicated that he transferred his further stay to the office.
This is why he is disappointed about the budget.
As a result, according to Necas, the nominees of social democracy (CSSD) who had made the changes in the budget did not do anything in the government.
The Premier should also make it clear that he will be back if Parliament continues to adopt laws on deficits, such as those relating to sickness and pensions or the rule of law.
Toplanek: The Ministers nominated by ODS are not upset
This is the case of the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The Ministers designated by ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek has highlighted in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries people are in a position to represent people who are familiar with TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide immediately to stay in the fight against the deficit of public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that they are based on the majority of the left in Parliament at the moment".
He can't count on the support and tolerance of the citizens.
I didn't think about it, and if this is going to be happening, I'll be busy with it, said Minister of Defence Martin Bartak, appointed by the Democrats, to the journalists in Parliament.
At the European Council's meeting in Brussels, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels.
The ODS returns to the wish of the Premier
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the revised budget on Wednesday in Parliament if the Premier explicitly asked the MEPs to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not appear to be wise children, we are not small children, so he then responded to the question whether ODS was not put back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the President of Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice that my vote would be wrong.
As soon as I refused the mandate, I knew that in the next few months there would be a lot of positive reactions to Parliament and to Parliament's destruction, too, topolanek himself.
Following the new driving plan of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains for about the same driving price will be used.
The Czech railway ends or is limited from 13 December to a few less speed and local trains; however, other connections are strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by 2 per cent from the date of validity of the new road plan compared to today.
Most tariffs including base and customer tariffs will not be changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway is equipped with the Pendolino type train for this route.
The train will no longer travel to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains are also on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, mainly reducing direct connections from Prague to Latvia.
The largest reduction is the railway in Hradec Kralove district (Königsgraz), totalling eight percent, on an increase, can be enjoyed against Prague and the environment.
Two trains will also be mounted on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis street and on a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis street will be reduced.
The major changes include the introduction of the new road from Milovice to Prague, and the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem have to move.
This is the fifteenth road to transport of the Esko pre-transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The distance to the capital will end at Prague - Main Station.
The CD opens more links SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Summerk/Jesenik will be driven within two hours.
With the Pendolino, the passengers can no longer travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's account for regional railways: an increase of 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total, the railway to compare the so-called liquidity loss in the next year is worth four billion dollars, as in this year. Local trains provide the areas, in total, eight billion dollars for which the state pays three billion.
In this year the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns expensive.
For local trains and fast trains, the railway has reopened a ten-year contract until now the contract has been concluded for only one year.
The railway praises the system, perhaps because it has not been able to reach a price increase in the large majority of the passengers.
For changes, it only comes with one-day online CD network and with cheap Internet access eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card the price CD Net will increase from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiska will then be dependent on the endangered stock until now he was one and cost 160 kroners for the journey between any districts.
The Philippines Militant took more than 50 people who were released.
Millitants were conducted today in the southern part of the Philippines by 75 people, including some basic students and their teachers.
This was introduced by the AFP Agency, which originally informed only over 65 outlaws.
All 17 arrested children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
It arrived in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Some 19 millilitants reportedly used the caves as living shelters when fleeing from the police.
The local negotiating leaders are now working on the release of the remaining treasures.
According to the AFP Agency, the militias are members of the New Volksarmee (NPA), which is the armed group of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the perpetrators because of the violence that required court proceedings between the two local families.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Magindanao, the law was upheld because of the recent massacre, where 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the mass massacre of 23 November, which coincided with the election to the governorate, were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippines province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested because of suspicion of involvement in the massacre.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao Island.
On Tuesday, however, the peace negotiations with the Philippines Government were resumed.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood comes into the American cinema "Invictus: the Unsuspected", which includes part of the history of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid was given by Morgan Freeman, who was apparently elected by Mandela a few years ago.
Matt Damon has been awarded the role of the leading South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar.
With the film's cinematography, responses from critics and the public are also being heard.
Nelson Mandela
The name is Nelson Rolihlha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sachar price, then in 1993 the Peace Nobel Prize with the Clerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are put in the film because it comes in the cinemas at a time when, on the other hand, the preparations for the World Championship in South Africa are being undermined, while the media are promoting the world public with exciting news about the growing racism and the discrimination of the peoples since the black majority dominates.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are primarily positive, despite numerous reservations about the crew of the main patrols with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new film.
I've been dreaming of this role for many years and prepared well for it.
I met Nelson Mandela myself several times personally so that I - as you say - could receive his energy, he conducted the interview after the film's party premium in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remind Mandelas and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the British writer John Carlin's written version, free translation ¿In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that unites the people, portraits the South African defender of human rights within his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman is trying to bring together two ethnic groups that have been cross-border for years and days and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he is also in his role in South Africa's National Rugby address on the World Cup field, which he won at the time in South Africa.
For the presence of the race in dress, which is almost as sacred as a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela has received great ovaries over the white audience for the past fourteen years and has thus won the recognition of the white population.
The Ruggbymestership may have made it possible to reunite the people to a single people, led by Ruggbypier Chester Williams, who was the only "Black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves is that it will show itself first.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, such as in a recent interview for LN by Rugby-Fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The Mastership begins on 11 June 2010.
Burn converters in Louny area for several 10 million kroner
The fire broke out tomorrow at the transformer of the company Ceps in the Schaltan facility at the village of Vyskov in the Louny area.
At the fire, six units were introduced, according to the speaker of the district fire department Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan.
Initially, the fires wanted to burn the transformers out, but later they changed their view and now the fire is wiped out with a mixture of water - foam and special solvents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internship.
No one was injured, the Havarie was not threatened by the company speaker, Pavla Mandava, the security operation of the management system.
The damage has been estimated at more than 10 million dollars, and the damage will be made only after the fire.
The damaged transformer must be replaced by a new one in accordance with Mandava.
Over 10 years has nothing like it happened in the company Ceps. Errors of this kind are rare, they added.
The electricity supply was not interrupted, according to the CEZ spokesman for Nordbohmen, Sona Holingerova, and the fire of the tram station did not influence the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps is operating in the Czech area as the sole operator of the management system, with 400 kV and 220 kV power lines.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 power plants with 67 transformers, which transfer electricity into distribution systems and direction routes with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura has a criminal case against three leaders of the CSSD.
The owner of the student agency, Radim Jancura, is now sentenced to three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the South Sea district, Radko Martinek from the Pardubice district and the leader of the Olomouc district, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview on the radio newspaper.
The complaint depends on the company's efforts to operate regional transport in certain areas.
Finally, all regions signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders approach us and say that we take out the roses, in which we have only distributed the offer over the extent of how it was agreed with them.
They claimed that we are more expensive than the Czech Railway because we would know the prices of the Czech Railway that were completed last week.
There's nothing else left for us than to turn us around.
Because of this confusion of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio newspaper.
At the same time, he pointed out that he had evidence from all regions that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hasek maintains the collection of punishments for the further continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves him as free advertising for his society as well as for his own person.
Of course I am willing to defend my good names as well as the good reputation of my neighborhood, and I also call for further leaders.
I believe that it will also be clear in this case that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the case of regional road traffic and uses false and indirect arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he invested several million dollars in the advertising that will be indicated on the next step in the region.
He told the radio newspaper that he was reporting the campaign after Christmas and wanted to continue it after New Year's.
He explained that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed on the operation of the regional railway with the Czech railway and had not issued a statement for the order of some 150 billion dollars.
According to Vancura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of traffic in the areas, he was threatened, according to Jancura, by an officer of the CSSD.
The only reason we didn't forget is that we could lose bus licences.
He presented himself as the head of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't tell him his name, Jancura told the radio newspaper today.
Immunisation against pneumococcals free and voluntary
Inflammation against pneumococcals has changed the habit since January.
It should be free and voluntary for the families first.
But now there are votes to declare that the obligation will be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococks.
The Institute of Medicine has already established the maximum rates of vaccines to be paid by health insurance.
The experts are also aware of the procedure for administration.
New Implicit
Inflammation free for children August
From January, children can be punished free of charge against pneumococks, which were born on and after the last year of August 2.
The condition is that they have not yet received a dose of vaccination.
Anyone who has begun with the imputation in the past year or earlier must also pay further reimbursement.
The first vaccine dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th months of life of the child.
In the past year, a quarter of the families have taken their children against pneumococks.
The parents paid $1600 and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the implanting of the youngest children.
In general, experts estimate that the hospital insurance for the immunization doses amounts to between 300,000 and 450,000 kroner per year.
However, they save the treatment that the children would need without infection.
To date, the state has issued approximately 500,000 per year for all of the children's seizures.
The obligation enforcement was introduced with the so-called Janeta package.
Pneumocokine causes mid-life, but also serious infections including brain redundancy and blood transfusions.
Pneumocokine infections kill us after an investigation into hospitals every year up to 28 children between the ages of 10 and 10.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the obligation to punish children against pneumococks was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the imputation be mandatory?
At the same time it is said that this impasse could be a future obligation.
From January this should be paid by insurance and be voluntary.
That the obligation would be better, for example, mentioned the head of the Nahlas Civil Union, Rudolf Kalovsky.
Its association is already long-term for the pneumocokin infection.
The experts at the international conference at which we attended were not very satisfied that we had voluntary implications.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed at least to implement it.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the anti-pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At this point we will not consider this at all, said his speaker Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary immunization has its consequences, the doctors claim.
The president of the professional company of practical pediatricians, Hannah Cabrnochova, says that a voluntary influence has its consequences.
If all children were infected, then you could think about reducing the number of relapses "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination has been launched as voluntary," says Cabrnochova.
The experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to receive their babies against pneumococks from next year.
The impact on pneumococcals is also due to the fact that it is paid as the first area of health insurance and not by the state.
The insurance should issue the money for the prevention to save it for further treatment, Cabrnochova says.
The doctors must buy the vaccines themselves.
However, concern is linked to the use of the active substance for the purchase of vaccines.
Following the original project, vaccines should be purchased by insurance and treated by doctors on the same path as other vaccines issued to them by the State.
However, some of the members feared that insurance insurance could be so "that money could be paid out of the hospital insurance".
Therefore doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance is paid to them.
According to estimates, each practical doctor will have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
That won't even be easy, Cabrnochova says.
US Artist's Son participated in the "Museum Diebstal"
The son of the famous American Fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal 20 million dollars from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was found in his vehicle with trailers when inviting 90 images.
It is Frank Frazetta Junior and another man had used a baker to enter the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his performance of such works as Conan of the Barbar and Tarzan.
As the news agency Associated Press reported, the artist appeared at the time of the incident in Florida.
AP quoted an outstanding police officer who said Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family affair.
The agency reported that, according to a police statement, Frazzetta Junior claimed that he was appointed by his father "that he should move into the museum with all means to bring all images into a warehouse".
The Agency shared that Frank Frazetta Senior is fighting to grant any permission.
Labour protects state and tax increases
The ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure cuts announced in the previous report against the criticism of opposition, economics and trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling would have had an opportunity to "strengthen" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by making decisions until after the election.
The complainant also ruled that he intended for low- and medium-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5-percent increase in social insurance and a 1-percent cut-off limit for 2011 of the public remuneration.
Social insurance undertakings
The companies have protested, however, that low-carbon recipients are being punished for a recession they have not caused and warned of previous "problems".
The increase in social insurance - on about 3 billion British dollars per year - has increased the private economy, which says this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic growth.
The increase that is limited to those that earn more than £20,000 per year will affect about 10 million workers.
INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PUBLIC REPORT
Increase in social insurance by more than 0.5 % since April 2011
This year the economic collapse of more than 4,75 % is expected
New 50 % tax on bankers' bonus
1 Percentage increase in body tax for small enterprises
Tax charges for electro-vehicles and wind turbines
State interest rate increase by 2,5 %
According to estimates of the estimate, someone with an annual income of $30,000 per year will be worse than $90 per year and someone with $40,000 per year will be less than € 190 per year, while a person with €10,000 per year will be more rich than € 110.
The ministers said that their target of deficit relief by 2013 was "hard decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would fall to 5% of the top officials.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms argues that the skimmed tax increases and cuts in comparison with the necessary measures would be "a drop on the hot stone".
"These are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit relief, and this is also necessary over the next four years, quite unconditionally," he shared with the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party’s predictions of future economic growth – which will influence the scope of the debt debt and the speed of the deficit delivery – have been questioned after the estimate was forced to review earlier numbers.
He said in his opinion that this year the economy is likely to collapse by 4.75% - much more than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April - while debt of 3 billion £ would be higher than before.
"Excellent opportunity"
The conservatives who wanted to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of the "debt crisis" of Labour said that the planned debt of 789 billion dollars over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that the ministers have failed to present a credible plan to repay this and to press "genic" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
"They haven't said anything about what they're going to do," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do this and they've let them go."
"The significant announcements are made only after the choice, who will always win them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Work requires that schools, hospitals and the police be preserved before future cuts, other than in the proposals of conservatives, who see their deficits faster and faster.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money won by tax increases and expenditure stops is used to cover expenditure for the next year, not to reduce deficits, and argue that the plans are "on sand".
The policy editor of BBC, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements - such as the inflation adjustment in some disabled people in April next – would put the money back on the vote because it could simply be recovered in the next year.
The work needs to provide extra assistance when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler State"
Although the ministers have not provided any details about 2011, economists say that the pressure on public expenditure will only be brought in by medium-term.
The recognised tax investigation institute said that the number of the treasurer would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly also in the fields of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only eases pain later," said his leader Robert Chote.
"The significant announcements are made only after the election, who has always won them," added Roger Bootle, an economic consultant at the company's audit.
"This was just the high report of the preamble. The markets recognized it."
FBI research "Takes of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported US citizens because of the suspicion of extremist relations in Pakistan.
The men were arrested during an accident at a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandshab province, sharing the American message in Pakistan from the BBC.
The FBI said it will be examined whether the same men were reported missing last month in the United States state of Virginia.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said they were also looking for information about men.
Three of them should be a pagan descent, one is an Egyptian origin and the other has an Yemeni background.
"If they are U.S. citizens, of course we are very interested in the charges they are accused and under what circumstances they are arrested," said speaker Ian Kelly.
The FBI speaker Katherine Schweit said that the authorities were informed about the arrests and were in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identity and the purpose of their stay there if it is indeed the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani message in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had previously been interested in the house and that there were no complaints against the arrested men.
The news agency Reuters reported that Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton could comment on the findings, but she said that the United States must "co-operate with Afghanistan and Pakistan in order to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism, which still recruits and trains people".
The five students were reported missing by your families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty sentenced "Miss need" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as it was in the past 20 years.
The report details "Missuse pattern" by the regime, both before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was shot and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran showed previous criticism of its human rights balance.
Official positions said such criticism was politically motivated.
After President Mahmud Ahmadined's election, thousands of people were arrested and killed in Iran, leading to the largest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Thousands of convicted prisoners and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC-Teharian Correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, some of the allegations of abuse were acknowledged and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak strike.
But since there has been no tolerance from the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False spirit"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old IT student Ibrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of "work with Facebook networks" and protesting against election results.
"They hit me more often in the face," he quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes in my eyes, in my neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a wrong attitude and became, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, shares Amnesty with him.
The wounded presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured in August in prison and raped by others.
The Iranian authorities lied to the claims of rape, but they said that abuses had occurred.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained with 75 others for more than eight weeks in a concentration camp in Kahrizak.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had established a committee to investigate the disturbances after the election and the Government's reactions, but Amnesty, the mandate and the power of these bodies were unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees were not published.
The group said that at least 90 people were arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a sign into a battleground in Bristol.
The skiers of this park event included 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
On the top of the Hangs in Brandon Hill Park there was a short spring chance at the beginning of a 100-metre long Hangs.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said that there was a beautiful look from the hipple of the hang, but it was also very beautiful.
It's a great view with all the lights of the city below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some right talents."
Prices were paid for the best pieces of art or tricks performed on the hang.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will be left to dry.
Still her and us.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Switzerland's electors voted for a mining ban and the concern about the alleged Islamicization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a thorough and well-advised report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe's most declared secularized societies — and integrated.
Some readers will be amazed by this new book for the last work of the author: "Why don't the French love no headlines" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and well-arguing study of a conflict that has been shared and occupied by the country over the past decade and is still taking effect today.
Bowen's new book offers a more comprehensive and cooler spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France but what really happens in the area.
He spent months in Moscow, schools and institutes, which now provide between 5 and 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen called "Islamic spaces".
He's a good listener, he's having discussions between teachers and students about the issues that bother them most.
Whether to marry a Muslim in a mosque or a Rathaus (or both)
Whether young Muslims should be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it possible for a Muslim to use a censored banking system to get a mortgage?
These are seemingly proficient matters, he claims that those who make up everyday life are totally contrary to the political dramas that the media are dealing with.
The author recognises a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name, perhaps with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim teacher born in Switzerland and academic.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim and on the other hand a good citizen of a modern secular society.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
Conservatives are mysteriously opposed to the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists interviewed by Bowen are mostly alone with their Salafi objects – supporters of the Puritan Sunni Islam, which is connected with Saudi Arabia – today show a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
However, an agreement requires a provision and adoption on both sides.
He asks how French political decision-makers (and intellectual elites, which are so tolerant of the separation of the Church and State) really feel obliged to feel pluralism.
He points out that Muslims may experience worse treatment as Catholics, Protestants and Jews who, on the other hand, had to do their historic compromise with secular republicism.
Rather, he recognizes a "increasing of values" as a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book you're happy to say "Yes, but not yet".
The Unfailing Look of the World
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice that she signs smells at alarming speed and takes life with which she can survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have taken place in the modern open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their source.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws a natural history of the icon of the north, the icebar.
Embarrassed in the complicated history and policy of Walfang, he describes the long tradition of architects who have proved themselves to be on the ice bars.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an icebrow as a 14-year-old footfish to the sea, who fought only with the gunball of his Muskete, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bear who were arrested when they collapsed behind the bodies of their recently murdered mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 ice pellets in a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically own a millionth of the area of life of a wild altimer. The climate is rare: the ice bar in Singapore has been completely green with algae growing in its long hair.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often goes back to the threat posed by the hunters for the survival of the species.
Despite the ban in Norway, America and Russia, the construction in Greenland and Canada continues to use bicycles in helicopters and motorcycles from powerful powered currents to carry their luggage.
Ironically, the ice will remain in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the New Scientist magazine, offers a clear and encouraging description of the science of the Arctic and a packaged view of how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can properly explain the speed of change.
But this is not a lack of explanations.
The pioneer journeys by Fridtjoff Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries left the reconnaissance of the package for the first time.
Undersea boats in the Cold War measure the variety of freedoms in the process.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and large-scale delivery of mesh sands on icebergs, but many still will be reached by unscathed people who camp outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the own, changing world of the flow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater springs that are combined in freezing.
But, starting from the bar on ice to the microscopic small wonders in ice, all are at risk if the summer is forgotten, which is calculated between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... we could be."
Seafarers were among the 6,000 who landed at Arlington border
The super-free De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single yard on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other seafarers, who took the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Fridge Court in Arlington, to taste the funeral, the day was a trip to the men and women in their foot steps.
In a few months, from where we are always returned, we could be that, Robinson said about the missing soldiers.
If we were, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers gathered on Saturday morning to lay boundaries on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Friedhof.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred tombers at the Peace Court in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who undertake this journey every year, stop in different cities along the way to conduct events dedicated to the military and the victims of terrorism.
The workcesters also founded a joint organization, Wreaths Cross America, which has also extended the event to other countries.
In this year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 border crossings on the shores of the Arlington Friedhof, in the fields of the Pentagon, on the shores of the Fayetteville National Airport in Arkansas, on the Battery Park in New York, and on the United Airlines Airport 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation spent over $150,000 for the purchase and transport of the border for the second time.
Charlene Hunt, 70, from Westminster said that she had taken the trip to Arlington in mind to her husband, a lost professional soldier.
Although her husband is not finished in Arlington, dog said, this is her way to give back something that sacrificed.
She said that this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family farm.
Packed in hot clothes, the volunteers traveled across the extended grasslands and hills of the restroom.
The volunteers had older dignitaries from World Wars 1 and 2 and the Vietnam War as a target because they are not visited as often as the new diggers are, so the organizers.
The vote was happy, children played, and couples held their hands while they wore the fresh velvet to the gravestones.
Each round kranz was dark green with a small red blade that was attached to the upper part.
The section 60, which is near and where mainly veterans of war are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost silent.
The United Service Organizations spent 1,000 borders to make this section beautiful, but the dwindling voices of the current wars filled this area.
Individual wines were open, other meanings and families and friends held together in the east air.
Some of the names collected in stone appear, while others are down to small black-white square cards that were sealed for those who were stuck in the wet rock, whose gravestones have not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who spent their son's nightingales before her son's grave.
It is 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the Marine Frontier Interoficer David Shane Spicer, who died in July in the battle.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I'm not anymore for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractor of the U.S. Government of Cuban Authorities
The Cuban government has established a contracting official of the US government, the mobile phone and notebook computer sold in the country, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor who has not been identified so far is working for Development Alternatives Inc. with a seat in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers such as USAID, the US Development Authority and the World Bank.
Consular officers of the United States of America's interest in Havana are trying to gain access to prison, which was held on 5 December.
The special charges have not yet been published, although, according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested for almost everything under the charge of "dangerousness".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, are at risk of arrest.
Governmental enemy graphics and statements are considered to be serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, which is introduced by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who describes more often how she and her husband are followed and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to accept prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tensions between the Communist government of the Castro brother in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a "long" approach to improving relations on the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday evening.
The new US policy emphasizes that the United States will be rewarded if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desired products in a country where the average value of a government employee is 15 dollars per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, which is usually used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a day's wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government stations, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to register their names.
Access to many websites is limited.
The arrest of an American is rare in Cuba.
Most of the few US citizens in Cuba who are in prison are sitting because of crimes such as drug abuse behind bars, says Gloria Berbena, the press spokesman for the US interest in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide further information on the arrest.
The arrests and the arrests are clearly false.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, who recently published a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba" on the establishment of Raul Castro as the leader of the country that replaced the older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the accused would be arrested, tried and arrested very often within one day.
He said that every solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often has a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving together for more dialogue.
Pakistan government representatives cover plans to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities discovered allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers and said they hoped that this could help to detect an extensive network of terrorists who seek the Internet for radicalized young men.
They said that they were looking for an unexpected revolt, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had made it final, because one of them had given comments on terrorist attacks on the YouTube website.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal village, which is the home of Al-Qaida and its terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's Secret Service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince Al-Qaida leaders that men are not part of a CIA movement to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were arrested for days in the eastern city of Sargoha, far away from the barren mountains in the north-west, which have become a terrorist airport.
They were seen as part of a hidden operation.
They were therefore rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government officer said that the men were not discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to access Al-Qaida camps when they were taken by the Pakistani criminal authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI - underlines the decisive role of employers in identifying future terrorists and possibly even more important in deciding who is reliable.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US Secret Service has made it more urgent to submit human assets items within Al-Qaida.
The organizers of the organization act as sponsors who do not allow those who do not leave their commitment to the Holy War to be serious enough and who may be the spy.
American Power Master recruits will be subjected to a special test by A Kaida, said analysts.
However, because of their potential access to US targets and their promotional value, they are also considered inappropriate attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the largest analyst of the NEFA Foundation with seating in the United States, said that in recent years terrorist groups have also become much more cautious about whom they have allowed access, as US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to lock someone in these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have followed? Kohlmann said.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators demand in Copenhagen Climate- "Action"
Ten thousand demonstrators marched here on Saturday through the streets and demanded by the contractors at the Bella Congress centre of the city to deal with colder traffic in climate protection.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, although the police estimates were higher than about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists burned small explosive bodies near some government buildings in the city.
One day, when the UN's climate negotiations were not going on, thousands of tourists were traveling through the city, where there was no planet B in English and one in Spanish, which declared "The Earth says "genug".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travel to Peru, the country of her mother's birth, made them aware of what heartbreaking problems the country has to face because of the already devastating effects of climate change.
This is part of the reason why I have decided to take part in the great demonstration - to continue the word and appeal to world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's no easy task, but it has to be done now and there's no way out.
The police stopped the demonstrators from getting close to the Bella center and said they had arrested 19 people, mostly because they were either masked or carrying bags.
According to Danish law these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to an observer who did not want to be mentioned, since he is involved in climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing wore several explosive bodies near the Copenhagen main channel, where there are several ministries.
They were burning near the building, he said and added that they started as light rockets, but then they were followed by "a few great explosions".
In the center of the convention, people gathered in front of television screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest did not appear to have reached the awareness of the chief executives, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate manager.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he said in English, "That's something I didn't even know."
Then he went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is large, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would damage or help.
It shows the concentration of the broad public and various sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that it disturbs the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show a hearty race curve
The witness to mathematics last week was welcome news for public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the country's schools, the highest services are shown to have been made by the fourth and eighth graders over the past two years as cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is included in the latest national assessment of education progress (NAEP) is the heartbreaking performance gap between Afro-American and white students, both at local and national levels.
The average number of white black clasps from Washington D. C. has increased in the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), which has only increased by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Afro-American octopus remained on the same ground, and he fell to a statistically reliable point from 245 to 244.
The average number of white students was not included in the test data, as the sample level was not large enough.
The picture about a six-year period is also not encouraging.
The club, which separated the white and black fourth classer in 2003, when the first NAEP was found in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points that children have achieved in both groups has increased in this time span, the difference with now 58 points has nearly decreased.
Some teachers in the district last week expressed their concern that the results which were celebrated by Mr. Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were promoted to most of the white students who are already active children.
This means that we have raised the overall assessment by the treatment of those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of D.C. Voice, a joint group who is involved in the equality of education in Washington D.C..
I don't jump for a span of two or three points up and down, said the Democratic Washington City Council member, Khome R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton Primary School.
Brown, a more frequent critic of the Rhee management style, said that the message of the testing points is that the city's middle schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs that I respect.
What concerns me, however, is that we do not have to use the time and energy that we have to use for our secondary school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
For example, some teachers are asked to use a new lecture plan, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper secondary and secondary schools, which did not master the basic skills of the school at the beginning of their school course, and which are significantly behind their parallel class cameras.
Daily mathematics, a learning plan, which is based on the children's garden to the sixth class of games and life-long experiences, was brought to Washington under the former leading school inspector Clifford Janey and some of the NEP progress reported last week will be written.
I believe that we must continue to work to bring the best measures to the students at the level of notation, said Rhee.
Others say that the NEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and further provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which are few in order to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, researching city test results.
The conventional medicine is aimed at improving its resources and management reforms to schools located in the worst areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could have a political impact which would work against this important agenda.
The weak point is of course, as in other urban school inspectors, that they try to keep the white and black middle.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the urban districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for the completion of the performance course is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington to compete with the Charter Schools.
You have to increase your school year to about 200 days to have the power to change, Janey, who, with his teacher's work last year, said that he came to an agreement over 185 days a year, which he considered "a milestone" on the way to a larger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than for the future
The trip bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a sound pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises and shines a moment in view of the white sails, the steel capsand and the yellow race.
Gracielas parents have almost finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently Graciela, who was buried in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Her attitude and that of the other eight-class group that studied the Gettysburgsburg, where teaching costs $38.690 per year, were rather the respectable visitors than the enthusiastic students of the future.
"Yes! I will be here soon!" called Graciela, who wanted to study medicine when the leader announced that they now belonged to the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said sadly when she was told the low school professor-to-student relationship.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th which the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully accepted the intended message: The question is not whether you are going to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who do not end up or become pregnant as teenagers, but there are also hundreds of thousands who receive college education that is necessary to get up in the middle.
In fact, one of five of these "second generation" of Hispano-Americans excludes the college – which is a remarkable achievement, since many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce.
Those who are looking for powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for the school and a desire to succeed them.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of confidence in American schools.
But consultation programmes also play a large role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to get to college, especially if these efforts continue for a long time.
If you consider poor income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them with their journey through the system, then a single measure will not at some time solve the problem, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied Spanish students.
We need to think about setting up a support network for these children from school to high school.
The Federal Programme, which had funded Gracielas College tour, is an excellent example.
It is known as GEAR UP - one time high school - and makes more than $300 million a year available for local school systems to start college preparatory programs that start when low-income students are in high school and continue until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, more than 60% of whom have attended college.
Iraq's Ministry of Oil concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to bring more large oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure in two auctions completed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Oil Ministry show that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renewal of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been achieved through war and economic action for decades.
American companies were able to sell only shares in two of the 10 hidden fields.
Seven American companies had paid for their participation in the second auction which began on Friday.
The only company that has issued a bid has attracted the cuts.
Two U.S. companies were able to conclude contracts for fields which were enlarged in June.
The refined representatives of American olive oil at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry were surprised by the analysts.
Finally, after six years of war, Iraq has opened its doors and instead of US companies, Asian and European companies have introduced the way, says Ruba Husari, the publisher of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns that were still highlighted by mass-coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability by the withdrawal of the U.S. military has probably stopped American oil companies, say analysts have said to engage more heavily in Iraq, which has the world's largest proven raw materials reserves.
In some cases, US firms were optimistic because competitors, particularly the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and higher risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon Mobile and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Larger US companies, such as Chevron and ConcoPhillips, dealing with the Iraqi Oil Ministry, and in recent years with the Technical Council, have gone empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gasprom were the main players in two of these weekly contracts.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages to contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the speaker of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to become one of the greatest of the world's economy and a technology.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure itself with its partners and will fulfil its obligations against Iraq.
Offers were then made to the selected companies, which were then compared with the price per barrel of oil that the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the cost of each field beyond the current level.
Top planner of Al Kaida publicly killed in Pakistan
In an apparent US rocket attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan this week, a top user planner of Al-Qaida was to be killed, reported representatives of the US-Terrorist fight on Friday.
This would be, if it were confirmed, the second deadly attack on a high responsibility of the terrorist organization in this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities of the region, were to be killed by a number of rockets that hit her vehicle near the city of Miran Shah on Tuesday.
Other authorities reported that the rockets were fired by a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan's illegal ethnic group.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, said an official representative of a Pakistani civilian secret service from Miran Shah per telephone.
Local residents who are in doubt to belong to the militia fled to the scene and quickly took everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US counter-terrorism provided uncertain evidence that Somalia belonged to the dead.
Somalia was described as the leading military planner of Al-Qaida, leading the operations of terrorist groups outside Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in protests all over the world, noted a leading officer who wanted to remain anonymous and pointed to the heavy nature of US air raids on Pakistani soil.
Taking its central role as a given included planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from Al-Qaida's top leaders and put them into operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second US official said that Somalia was rapidly rising in the Al-Qaida hierarchy and provided better links to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this does not at all reduce the risk he posed for us and our allies.
If his death had been confirmed, Somalia would have been the second leading al-Qaida or Taliban leader who had been killed since September as a similar attack by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a military group in the tribal area and three other topakists.
Since the summer, the time of the attacks by the CIA's drones has gone back from an average of six operations per month to two pages, according to a summary of the Long War Journal.
The return can depend on improved tactics of terrorist groups taking steps to reduce their vulnerability and kill informants who are still in the dark, the page reported.
Head of UN Ambassador to Kabul will be returned
UNO's leading envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would be returned from his office in March, which would end a serial office time which would have been beaten by allegations of widespread corruption at the Afghan presidential election supported by UNO.
Once the Obama government has decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concern that the US military withdrawal schedule, which would start in 18 months, could allow other NATO governments to withdraw their combat forces.
We need to speed up the development of Afghan security forces and thereby send the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military authorities to increase the number of international civilian aid to help with the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not undermine his office but only one of his family's agreements reached in March 2008 to remain in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the message to UNO-
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now continuing to have time to take care of a replacement.
What I said was that he'd better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month vacuum between the walk of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban started looking for a replacement.
The UN representatives say he has taken into account the Swedish-Italian-speaking-Mistura staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously conducted UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, charged him in September to prefer President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and to exchange evidence of massive voter abuse.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the charges of Galbraith - which were burned - have undoubtedly added damage to the mission because there is already a great deal of creativity in relation to international integration in the election.
Edie said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the actions of the US-led combat forces in Afghanistan.
He also stressed that UN leadership would allow his successor to appoint more personnel from the United States and other Western countries that would contribute to the Afghan mission and said that this would strengthen their confidence that their money would be used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the circumstances of the UN configuration had undermined his ability to bring back people.
The UN rules are designed so that since May, he said, only one person could set up.
This is catastrophic and must not go on like this.
US Minister of Defence Gates: Iran has to take additional sanctions
Minister of Defence Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world power will soon be subjected to "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he has not participated in talks about his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and took the view of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good options for choosing, he said in response to a soldier's question about the probability of such a development.
"One of the things that lies in my soul is if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years which is the inevitability of the war itself."
The Obama government draws up a sanctions package, which aims at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average.
He said that "a package of positive and negative reasons" is necessary "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected by nuclear weapons", because "their people are not aware" will suffer under sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion from the White House speaker Robert Gibbs, the US government has joined European top-level politicians in warning that Iran must consider the "trusted" consequences if it does not meet the requirements of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Authority.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should be won only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume its talks on limiting its nuclear programme and that it would forget to a large part of its storage stock of sufficient uranium in exchange for an urgent need for nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US Government has insisted on this type of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
Since then, however, Iran seems to have left negotiations on the provisional agreement -- in part, experts have said that Iran's leadership is unique as to whether it should be committed against the United States.
That Iran has simply allowed the international community to stand up to some of the proposals which they had already agreed to in early October, it has openly said that the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, has brought together in a way and in a way that it has never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama has set the time limit for Iran to respond to these proposals before other options, including those called by Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once "pressure sanctions".
In an opinion delivered in New York, the Iranian representative at the United Nations condemned what it called on Thursday "foundless and unfunded claims" by a number of security members to the Iranian atoms and said they were ready to continue the negotiations with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a suitable long-term solution".
Gates, who was supposed to return to Washington on the last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before meeting with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and because of the distribution of public revenue.
Gates forced both sides to reduce the conflict potential in order to prevent delays in the US plans to reduce the U.S. troops force by the end of August from 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to ease the Kurdish concern about the leading group withdrawal. US representatives quoted Gates, who spoke to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government, said: "We will get your security, well-being and autonomy within a united Iraq.
We won't leave you."
A Change in Courses in Older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that they thought "Mother Earth is too late to keep children" and "A baby more means a grave".
These lessons have taught them so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who, by the low birth rate and the elderly population in this summer, began suddenly to change the course and encourage young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: "No case".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child there is nothing left, Wang said, 31, a personal leader with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single-child policy in China, two generations of notorious, neglected single children, who are known as "little emperors", are experiencing a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate is 1.8 children per pair compared to 6 at the time when this policy is in force, the UNO says:
Division for Population Questions, while the number of population groups aged 60 years and older in 2020 is 16.7 per cent of the population is expected to rise to 31.1 per cent by 2050. This is far above the global average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is stronger in many coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
In the last year, 60-year-olds and older people have avoided almost 22 percent of the reported residents of Shanghai, while birth rates are below a child per pair.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Planning and Family Commission, said that couples in reliable old-age babies need to "help to reduce the ratio of older population and reduce the labour gap in the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old as -- but not as rich -- as industrial countries like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A step-by-step break
In 1978, the Constitution of the country imposed on it, China's one-child policy must have been the most controversial one ever introduced by the ruling Communist Party.
Couples who are confused about these policies must count with enormous financial penalties -- up to their three-year term in some regions -- and with discrimination at their workplace.
China's representatives have written this policy that the critical condemnation of natural resources could be avoided, with which human rights abuses have been condemned in the implementation of the policy.
In rural regions some officials who have already had a child have been forced to drive away.
In addition, many couples had been able to conduct sex-selective operations, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards one child policy.
In 2004, they adopted more exceptions to the rule - including citizens, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both married and single children were married - and the tone of many hard-hearted slogans was reduced in 2007.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Peking University Institute of Population Research, said that government representatives had recently discussed radical changes, for example, allowing couples to have two children where a partner is a single child.
Shanghai was the first Chinese city to start an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Plakettes, which taught families to have only one child, were replaced almost overnight by directives, which described in detail who comes for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent city employees and volunteers for family planning to search for couples at home and to pass information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The response was not just encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Satisfying Response
Although officials from a rural village in the outlying areas of Shanghai said that a rise in the applications of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign did not notice any change in the urban areas.
In the municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, only four to five applications are still submitted every month.
The number of births expected for 2010 in the city despite the campaign will still be around 165 000 -- something higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, Chairman of the Family Planning Committee of the Shanghai Community Caolu, said that financial considerations are likely to be the main reason why many people no longer want children.
They want to give their first one the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that was also legally allowed.
But they, like many Chinese, own only a small amount of health and life insurance from the government.
Without a social network, they would say that this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West falsely consider the one-child policy to be a human rights issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we're robbed of the opportunity to have more than a child.
But the problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their teeth.
Wang, the personal leader, said that she wanted only one child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to be everyone concerned about us.
We are not used to caring for others and do not want this to happen."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unbrowsed.
For parents from the middle class with double careers, which reduces the birth rate, he said, it turns out to be successful and must be selfish for it.
The age group of today's 20-39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they wanted no life for themselves, he said.
A single child, he also said, sets enormous demands at the time of the parents.
A mother must give her social life at least for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life plan -- "If the child is 9 months old, you've got to have a lifetime for the best schools."
Most of his friends are ready to do this once, Chen said but not twice.
Our generation is the first one who has achieved a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UNO Group develops Emission Reduction Plan
The UN-supported climate conference -- which has so far been marked by wild spots and mutual allegations -- has again focused on the publication of a document on Friday, which has marked a huge drop in greenhouse gas for the next 40 years, while industry efforts in the near future have to bear the greatest burdens.
The text which could provide the basis for a definitive political agreement on greenhouse gas management has shown the remaining obstacles as well as the way forward.
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiations which would take time, as the next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will come to Copenhagen.
The text, formulated by a UN working group itself created for this purpose, goes beyond the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries in order to master global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a palette of options for key issues, including how industrial and large coastal countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the global temperature limit should be for political decision-makers.
The process will be given a great flexibility, says John Coequyt, Chief Representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has drawn up the six-page document, has compiled an 180-page long negotiating text to put it at the centre, which the leading UNO climate protection representative Yvo de Boer has referred to as "the great whole".
It shows the basis for a possible agreement in which the industry would reduce its emissions by 25 to 45 per cent by 2020 compared to the 1990 limit, while developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent at the same time.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Community has also given talks on Friday through its commitment to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to support better countries in adapting to the impact of climate change - from the master of overcrowding and doors to the prevention of desertification.
The Friday, however, brought together the same fire works that had been determined in the last week.
U.S. climate officer Todd Starn has rejected formulations requiring binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries compared with voluntary reductions for larger coastal countries if these are not financed by industry.
This train announced that the Obama government is driving a tougher line with China than the Bush government's representative not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the rise and action of larger developing countries, such as stars, who also claimed that the text was not far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Starn delivered his opinion one hour after the Chinese Foreign Minister He Yafei said that it was either the leading American climate operator's lack of "the wisdom" or it was "the most irresponsible" by him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help financially to master global warming.
Because the future economic orientation of the great world powers is at stake, both within industry and between industry and developing countries have emerged in Brussels.
The current fight is related to the salvation of individual economies as well as to the salvation of the planet, where China and the United States are empowered by their respective obligations, while weaker countries claimed that the two thousand more influential countries would ignore the need for scientific action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers should combat those who should bear the costs of braking the greenhouse gas emissions, since even the countries concerned have gone too far, to impose more aggressively on countries with very high greenhouse gas costs for their actions.
This is clearly a game where new economic governance is being developed, such as Ulate, who is also active as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most strongly affected by the effects of climate change have indicated that they would continue to fight a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that talks will be conducted in the best case to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States with 43 Member States presented a 24-page draft contract in early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who is leading international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of small island states "uses political pressure throughout the political process," partly because they are now united and demand measures from the developing countries, such as China and India.
The talks brought new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open issues had to be clarified before the arrival of the Heads of Government in order to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister of State, raise their aircraft and rush through the streets of the Bella Centre to meet behind closed doors and press conferences to hide the diamonds that will be negotiated during the next week.
The pure size of the assembly -- 13,000 people go to the convention centre every day, and guitar-responsive activists are conducting night shows where they make themselves fun over the countries that they have sold and sold their opinion, and contracts are hand-handled instead of e-mailed -- is already a challenge.
Intensity is based solely on: Almost all the important ministers are here now and since Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We're going to Oberlaga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Global Policy of the Organisation Conservation International.
The weights are coming.
Britain's first 225 km/h fast train defines the new moon feeling
In the morning, at 5 p.m., a bridge will pass through the darkness to announce an access road that represents a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed flight in the country will be reached at Ashfort, Kent on its way to London St. Pancras 225 km/h and will return 93 km in 38 minutes.
At Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, the Lady Kelly Holmes will then be on board the first Javalin Pendler Service from London.
He hopes that the new United Kingdom service will finally connect to an international rail network faster, reliable trains and will connect the great areas of the Mediterranean, North and Scotland to London.
The abandoned province could become viable pendler cities, reduced working hours would be radically reduced and the change in aircraft and vehicle would reduce national carbon emissions and noise on the streets.
In theory, the three great parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British funds needed to build a new national rail network, which could still carry the brakes at the British high-speed skis.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January, which is to present a feasibility study to the government, will report on 30 December.
This will provide a detailed map of the next level of the high-speed rail network.
The new road line, which is to connect London to the West Midlands, will be carried out with a space of five metres in urban areas and places where the effects on the environment are affected.
In the free area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final route.
HS2 should also create three options for a larger north-east leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will react in the morning.
The preferred option is an Y-shaped route which would lead to a single high-speed route in the West Midlands.
The route would be divided into or near Birmingham and would lead a distance west of the Peninsula to Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction of Nordosten to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle up to Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option," said one railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced by 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first half-way that would not be opened before 2025 would allow passengers to return the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today's one hour.
The design gave trainers the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h by which the British rail network would be Europe's fastest.
The first route was designed so that 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 persons could drive.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation on the London-Birmingham street every hour.
This would also mean that in London there would be a need for an end station that could be completed at the 20,000 passengers per hour.
In view of the space constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing railway station will be built to withstand the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston has this potential.
Lord Adonis will be informed whether this plan should be continued or not, but the longer-term public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after Parliament's elections.
But even if he moves the wheel, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains had to change from the high-speed routes to existing rail routes in northern Birmingham, which would continue to be between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This applies as a decisive turning point in order to ensure a change from the aircraft to the train, a direction for the rail revolution.
Tax rates come for mortgage for 75,000 pounds of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the lead member of the Conservatives, has taken into account the tax rate of thousands of dollars per year for the costs of an orange which he has been building in his home of his choice.
The prison speaker of the party, who was degraded by David Cameron because he complained that sub-home members had to live "from magic reasonings", has raised his hypothesis of 75,000 pounds to allow himself to build an oak wood factory at his second house in Rutland.
He had to take into account the additional interest income of the taxpayer, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The sub-house officials accepted the applications at the time and were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducted a review of the expenses of the sub-house members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could have been "not yet clean or understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest sub-home members, owns a double house in a village in his electoral circle Rutland and Melton.
In nearby houses, a purchase price of almost a million pounds (1.1 million euros) has been reached.
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, an underhouse control site, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden called "Orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors describe him as a "clause for entertainment".
Duncan was also not invited by the Committee for Standards and Privileges during a recent examination of its previous mortgage contracts to take an increased interest rate.
The Committee shall be free of charge within the last month following an examination of its expenditure in accordance with the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security of a mortgage over 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his election hall, which he had purchased a year before his election as a member of Parliament.
This week's published documents show that Duncan has recovered about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a mortgage by March.
In April, its claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS-Hypothec has not changed during this period, which is due to the total increase in the financing of the loan of 75.000 euros (€85.000).
The normal non-stop RBS hypotechnics declined from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March of this year, where it is still present.
The latest documents published from the basement show that Duncan continued to apply his address to 1.250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month in May.
Duncan lost his post as the opposition leader of the basement in September, after a undercover reporter filmed him after he said after the release scandal that members of Parliament would live "of the worst rationale".
"In essence, it means working for the state that you have to live with magic reasoning and are treated like S*****e."
He said: "I have spent my money for my gardens and have demanded a great deal of it to be measured by what is in it.
And I could have demanded all the damn sum, but I didn't."
The member of Parliament, a millionaire from his former career as an oil dealer, was first arrested for his expenses in May when it became clear that he had demanded thousands of dollars for his garden before he had declared with the Fees Office that "this could be considered a superfluous requirement".
As a protester in Duncan's racer, an activist buried a hole in the form of a punctuation after being known to have demanded about 4,000 pounds over three years (EUR 4,500).
When he was asked last night about the high mortgage, Duncan said: "It was both from the Fees Office and from Legg to the value rise."
He added: "There is no debate on gaps and overlaps or a violation of the rules or the like.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is acceptable and everything.
It couldn't even be cleaner and clearer."
All your fellow believers come to admire Brighton's beach hut-advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group, which focuses on spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their halls for each December with Christmas leaders as a topic.
The event started on 1 December and visitors were allowed to watch the newest huts every day from 17:30 to 18:30 at a free swimming pool and traditional Mince pizzas, with dry fruits filled with dried vegetables.
The selected Christmas songs so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The First Noël", where the wedding decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honored spiritist of the Chichester diocese and director of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we expect people as a church to come to a rare old building? I think the church should go to the people and celebrate exciting festivals.
The idea of the beach hut-advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends during the evenings.
Brighton is such a great creative and living place and we try to express it through our spirituality."
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide and Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have taken several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands of people, are marching in the cold of the Danish capital, at the end of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to an end to Friday, which could take effect from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the increasing mobilization in the world contributes to the climate, as these demonstrations give rise to the high "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen.
The events in the Danish capital were soon after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, knocked out windows with plastic stones and doors, established a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-absorbing police officers have suddenly and unhindered, attacked.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your assessment, are mainly members of "the Black Blocks", of these extremely violent splitter groups that have already been established at Nato Sumit in Strasbourg, East France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has established the conditions under which hundreds of military supporters were "undistinctly" criticised, and stressed that about a hundred of you "were still in the streets on Saturday evening," despite extreme colds with hands and seating.
The more peaceful course has been taken by Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators have kept about 500 meters away from the building without attempting to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers for a night with candlelight, under the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators are angry with buses and trains from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Korean people, as well as some Africans, were present.
About 3,000 people, most of you with blue skyscrapers, have performed a first exercise in Copenhagen in the morning, since you have followed the call of the friends of the earth to form "blue times" for "climate justice".
Today we go to the streets to ask for a recovery of the ecological debt in favour of the south , Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue this way and tell ourselves: we have time, I mean Angelique Kidjo, a singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that can be flown, where water runs, as was never the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, based on the adoption of the UN Agreement in 1992, the movement of the Globalisation Critics has led to environmental organisations.
European Commissioner José Bové, designed by the Globalisation Critics, announced that he had come to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific area, where there are many islands that are particularly threatened by warming, has given the Committee to the demonstration.
According to the organizers in Australia, about 50,000 people went on the streets.
In Manila there were hundreds of people, mostly students who are marchin' in red and have hit Bandanas, where you have glorified solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, as well as in Canada, there were a few hundred demonstrators to demand an energy approach against climate change.
In France, the demonstration organized by the network "350" has collected hundreds of people, namely Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West), and Lyon (East).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has chosen its presidents, Georgia declares that it is a strike here.
On Saturday, Abkhazia has chosen its presidents, which took place more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist geographical area as its own, Tbilisi declared the "Strey".
About 131,000 people were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgia War of August 2008 for control over the South Ossetian region, another Georgian sessionist area, which was recognised by Russia.
The election sites have closed at 17 hours GMT.
The electoral participation was approximately 58 % some hours before the election was concluded, according to the Abkhazia Election Commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced on Saturday night.
The five candidates, including the so-called President, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia which condemns the election.
These choices are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, told his press spokesman, Manana Manjgaldze, that Abkhazia is now under Russian total control.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world is part of Georgia, which is legally occupied by Russia.
After it separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, where thousands of people die, Abkhazia would like to prove through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who chose to choose a choice in a choice hall which was located in a school in the capital of Soukhumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees before the entrance.
The question of Russian Dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large images of which Bagapch on the side of the Russian President and Head of Government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are found everywhere in this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, who is in the east of the country, the district chief Beslan Archba has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he has said at a small festival, as an expression of Moscow's support, in particular with regard to the decision, of Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, responded and raised a glass of Woodka.
On the other hand, the opposition, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticised the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as those that left the control of the railway in Abkhazia Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus a vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieve this limit value, a second selection cycle must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos World, floods in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people have demonstrated around the world to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen climate conference, where the police, at any time ready to use, have established an important demonstration.
Thirty-one thousand people reported police, hundreds of thousands said to the organizers in the second half of the Danish capital, who received delegates from 193 countries seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train headed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators have been held about 500 meters away from the center and have not tried to enter.
A stage was built to welcome the scheduled speakers for a night with candlelight, attended by former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train was over, a group of demonstrators, who were completely dressed in black and armed with backstones and brakes, started to hit the discs, established a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-unsanitary police officers have rushed into you immediately and have suddenly attacked you by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police announced that between 600 and 700 people were arrested and explained that it was mainly about members of the Black Blocks, these extremely violent splitter groups that were already known as Nato Sumit in Strasbourg, East France, in April.
In the meantime, a police officer was arrested by some twenty persons in an accident. Four vehicles burned near a busy house.
"We have the extreme groups in the grip," stated the speaker of the police, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces circled in the air.
Most demonstrators who traveled by train or with their own vehicle from Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Korean, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the blue rain forest, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should be "Blue Seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we go to the street to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't tell us anymore: We still have time," says the singer Angelique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that flow, there are running water, through which man can run, which was never before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was called into force in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the Globalisation Against Environmental Protection Organizations was initiated.
The French Members of the European Parliament and Globalisation critic José Bové said against AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no more difference today between the fight against earthquake and the fight for another world."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christiansen or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson who are turning to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific space in which many islands are especially vulnerable to earthquakes has given rise to demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, about 50,000 people went on the street.
In Manila, several hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed red with Bandanas, before the city administration of the capital of the Philippines for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people joined in demonstrations organized by the "Net of 350" in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
A number of people gathered in Geneva.
The fields of geography and history go according to Chatel strengthened by the reform of the Lycées.
National Minister of Education Luc Chatel stated in an interview that appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du Dimanche" that the poor were encouraged by the reform of the schools of lycées, even if they are not mandatoryly informed in the 12th school year.
"The students of the Première (11th year of school) now have all four hours and the same program," said Mr. Chatel.
For the Minister, "we must overcome this quality," for he says that "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in large and large parts a concentration "the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) cannot be a scientific sub-profile," he continued. "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who have been involved in the lack of historical and geographical education in the terminals on technical lycees."
On Saturday, an IFOP question appeared in Humanité that almost seven out of ten French (69%) were critical of the state project of strengthening compulsory education in history and geography in the terminal S (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also lacked this project, as well as the left and some representatives of rights.
The Minister replied, however, that there was no question regarding a restriction on the philosophy of the S Terminal Program.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) had called for a protest against the project on Tuesday, which they felt was due to the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that at the beginning of the year, at Master 2 (M2) they were subject to a professional qualification test and at the end of the year of an authorisation test at which their teaching skills were tested.
In addition, they conduct practice during the year in M2 and then teach a year before the students as teachers in practice.
He went on to say: "If you add all the practice offered before the performance test, you will get more hours you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the Minister stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "cause that does not exist in the education of people."
He confirmed again that he wanted to create the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normal Superiore"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the use on the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change", had to deal with at the School Normal Superiors in Rue d'Ulm in Paris on Saturday morning.
As a journalist of the AFP, peacenobel Presbyterian Jean Jouzel opened the first "Ernest" conference, at which experts spent 15 minutes each with filmed contributions to the public.
One would like to take a look at how people are reached and how they feel, to learn more, Edward Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, at the end of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the names the students have given the fish in the school base.
"Among the experts, about the twenty discussion participants were selected, even after their charisma," he said.
"To climate warming you can speak for hours. The core objectives can also be set in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke only with the help of Folien.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in hope that the audience would agree that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos produced by these conferences will be found online on the school's side from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will then be held every two months.
Payment delay : hot prison terms, planned actions
The work of the criminal service officers has called on a general day of action on Friday to ensure that the premiums and overtime paid from budgetary reasons to January are transferred before Christmas.
The 2nd cooperation of the criminal prosecutors ("FO-Pénitentiaire") requested employees who did not have any services to demonstrate on the day before the trial tomorrow and to block them in order to pay attention to "the depth of what belongs to them".
The 3rd Cooperation of the Criminal Service ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "unify to a strong mobilisation in the various prisons" to which the non-payment of the overhours, night attacks and Sunday and holiday attacks in December will be burned as "cool and unacceptable".
The first cooperation of the criminal officers, the autonomous federal criminal union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and jealousy."
The leadership of the criminal justice system and the Ministry of Justice stated that the overhours were very busy in 2009 and not all were in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining requirements will be met in January.
As told by the Ministry of Justice last night, Michele Alliot-Marie has sent a letter to the staff of the criminal officers ensuring that the payment is made in the next month.
"I am very well aware of the staff's efforts to keep our criminal justice system functionally and modernise," the Justice Minister shares in this letter.
"I have indicated the leadership of the criminal action plan to take immediate action to prevent such a situation that has been caused by the lack of appreciation of the hours of the attack from continuing in the future," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
Therefore, the December salary falls worse than for the lead staff, who are benefiting from higher service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA for which "budgetary pressures" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the Interregional Cooperation FO in Marseille urges itself to "all assemblies and meetings" until new instructions are issued.
"The staff will not go to work on Sundays and holidays if the hours of October are still not paid in December. This is also true for their overtime," says the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"In a time when we are being given more tasks without more staff being appointed, the attempt to secure the staff's money is more than inadequate," says Bordeaux's CGT network.
As a result, the situation is not the same in all regions. Some are less affected than others.
However, it is illegal in any case, the Secretary-General of UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama is the view he distributes Christmas more gifts than he gets himself.
American President Barack Obama, who was first spent Christmas with his family in the White House, announced at the TV Talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he would always share better gifts than he would have.
On a special mission that was broadcast on the ABC Channel on Sunday evening, the President and his wife Michelle gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrative home.
Even Bo, the little four-year-old partner of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo", confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog also receives a present.
Michelle Obama has shown her husband's claims about the quality of the gift. "I have made you a beautiful gift last year," she says to the president.
"So please," he replied sculptically and pointed to the first Lady pearl chain: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour show in an atmosphere of unrest with the famous television moderator, Barack Obama had so much support during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they had enjoyed as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bike with ten legs and also a basketball ball that his father, whom he had seen very rarely, had brought to Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father visited us on Christmas nights and brought me a basketball," said the President.
"Before long I realized that I had this ball from him."
The first Lady remembered her side at her doll house.
"I didn't know how to order the furniture in a house, so I put it all on the wall instead of grouping it around the door. But I loved this little doll house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reopened, RTL confirms that he was transferred to an art team
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles because of significant "damages" after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was moved into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was reopened on the night of Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors "Injurys as a result of an operation of a band discontinuance", which he had performed in Paris on 26 November, so his production company in Paris, which added that these injuries had required a new operation.
However, the production company of the singer wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and shared that a new medical opinion would be available at least 48 hours later.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tournament of the singer, however, Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma to avoid "saches and complications".
Only 48 hours later, however, there was a little more certainty about the patient’s condition when he opened his eyes, adding RTL.
At the request of the AFP there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "out of certain sources" has been placed after its first operation in Paris "no" .
The Rocker was operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a band disco.
The surgery planned several days ago was carried out by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well - known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday for comments against RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday's operation, the singer was delivered on Monday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles because of a follow-up infection.
The singer Eddie Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, was against RTL on Thursday of the view that his friend just went through a "deep valley". However, he assured that he needed "no worry" to make the rock musicians, since this was "a good fighter".
"He had called me before his departure to Los Angeles. I told him it was a mistake to put himself in a plane after such an operation for twelve hours," said Eddie Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "well responds to antibiotics" and that "the infection is affected".
Mr. Camus also stated that he had spoken with Laeticia, the woman of the singer, and he had not given any special assurance.
However, the concern about the singer’s health was growing ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he was injured on his jacket.
Two months later, the general surprise was that Johnny Hallyday had a "small dermkrab-OP", which led to a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer took up his long "Tour 66" as a departure tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been explicitly commented. Fans and journalists have not concluded that the singer had a lot to move on the stage.
In mid-November, the people around him had to claim a re-entry into the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: The first place for Bousquet over its love distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-way medal winner at the 2009 Swimming Environment Championships, has held an international title on his favorite distance, 50m freestyle, on the Euro-2009 short train in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethanes were allowed, there were only three world records, while a real record stream was expected.
One record was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m levels of the Lords.
Bousquet, who wanted to capture the world record at 50m freestyle, holds its record in large beak (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in the swimming pool, 50m-freestyle, the 28-year-old franchise was claimed in 20.53 S. in a final with ten skimmers at the start (usually eight are) - a premium at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but it was not possible to break the world record (20.30).
"You can believe more and more, and in the present case I have said, if the world record is in my scope, I will try it."
How Bousquet started almost all Swimmers in polyurethane rings which have been banned since 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epos in Istanbul, which began in 1999 during the same competition.
The use of the combination has not been paid at the end of this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two world masters in the fields of this summer in Rome and world record.
The young Swimmer has not been able to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77) yet he has spent himself with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danes Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I haven't given everything this time.
I knew I couldn't make a world record today, but I have defended my title and fulfilled my mission."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Beedermann said.
USA : record record at Zola at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman record plate, calculated at the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated on Thursday at $1.5 million over its value, says the artist Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the third century B.C.E. and has always been valued with $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on which "four scenes of the dionysos are shown in a sophisticated architecture decoration, surrounded by satyrs and backing figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice-President for the expansion of Roman and Egyptian antiquities at Sotheby's, on Tuesday against the AFP.
It was sold in hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is certainly what most buyers have so far offered," said Sotheby's speaker, Dan Abernethy against the AFP.
The discovery of this purchase of the marble piece by Emile Zola is far back.
The plate was almost 300 years old in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family at home, and then it was filled with pieces for the French actor Cécile Sorel, who was used in her Paris hotel bathroom and at Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshall Petain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
In the search for Louvre's database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of an "Erbes von Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Therèse Raquin" and the Fresco "Rougon-Macquat".
Zelayas Travel test from Honduras Direction Mexico has been destroyed
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the ruling Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on domestic soil as no longer agreed upon, after which the Portuguese Government had rejected this initiative as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation last night with President Zelaya, everything seems to mean that there is only one way to carry out this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, said.
According to the immigration authority, the aircraft submitted by the Mexican Government which was landed in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transfer by Mr Zelayas was returned to its destination.
The Portuguese Government wanted Mr. Zelaya to "develop" and to seek political asylum for him abroad.
The President-in-Office, however, let this go because he wanted to return to Mexico as a congratulating Head of State.
The Portuguese regime "has had a new failure by wanting me to move on my costs (...), they wanted me to give up," said Mr. Zelaya against Radio Globo on Thursday, where he has been reporting frequently since the beginning of the political crisis that has been taking place in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here good and happy for ten years, here I have my guitars, added the upset president who had fled two and a half months ago to the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa under attack.
The Mexican message has presented us with a petition for guidance which we cannot accept, however, because it did not include asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of Interior of the Portuguese Government, explained against the Honduran radio HRN.
I'm not looking for asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the channel TV, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible trip from Honduras, he had underlined, would only be the president of the Honduran people.
The rumors about a visit by Mr. Zelayas had mobilized the supporters of the injured president, who had listened to the Brazilian message and gathered around it, where the local military had strengthened his use.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the Portuguese Government.
This, in his view, reveals the marginal character of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had challenged Venezuelan socialist President Hugo Chavez on 28 June, was seized on the day of his public inquiry into the preparation of his re-election against the Council of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
He returned from his exile in Costa Rica on 21 September and had fled to Brazil.
If he leaves this, he will be arrested for his high-ranking office, where he is charged with justice, then the Portuguese Government.
The Portuguese President, Roberto Micheletti, was able to organize a presidential election on 29 November to cancel Mr Zelaya.
In the course of the contested election, Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States, however, by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later the Congress had voted massively against Mr. Zelayas' return to the office until his mandate was completed on 27 January.
Wall Street in the rise, the US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Thursday with an increase in the number of U.S. trade balance figures from a short-term holding of the United States shares and its partners: the Dow Jones has increased by 0.67%, Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at source closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq once again dominated by technology from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended Index Standard & Poor's 500 was added by 0.58 % (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There are good news from various economic sectors, Judge Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotic under the premise that the market focuses only on "half-glass", so she measured it.
According to Peter Cardillo by Avalon Partners, investors are primarily fixed on the numbers of US trade balance, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6% by 32.9 billion in October compared with September.
In contrast, the analysts had calculated a deficit growth.
Both imports and exports have been added.
The big news is the increase in the overall volume of trade, particularly in the export of goods, reflecting the economic growth of the United States' main trading partners, Christopher Cornell commented by the Company Research Economy.com.
In contrast, unemployment reports in the United States have increased in the last week against all expectations and have now reached the state of 474,000 applications.
However, for the last four weeks, the average value of new job seekers was "falling at the end of the year", Scott Marcoüller of Wells Fargo Advisors stressed.
The obligation market has fallen.
The profitability of government loans for 10 years is 3,482 % compared to 3,432 % of the service provider, and the profitability of loans for 30 years is 4,492 % compared to 4,408 % of the previous night.
Cuba: Hundreds of prominent participants "women in Weiss" from
Some hundreds, with Cuban power on Thursday, married couples assembled for the purpose of the World Law Day in Havana have been excommunicated by political prisoners, as well as by other clients, which has resulted in the temporary adoption of a good thousands of dissidents.
For the forty "women in Weiss", married or related political prisoners, were fired on an open street by party members of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were at the Fussmarsch in the center of the capital in order to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Saldner!", "The road belongs to the revolutionaries!", "It lives Fidel and Raul!" the authorized partyers scandalized the dissidents with their pride.
The last were escorted by civilians who appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "women in Weiss" had taken place last night in Havana, where it came neither to victims nor to prisoners.
In the port area of Vedado, however, a dozen dissidents who also took part in the demonstration on Thursday in the face of the International Human Rights Day were temporarily arrested by civilian police, confirmed by AFP.
According to this journalist, the police have forced dissidents displaced by the government under violence to enter civilian vehicles.
The temporary arrest of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As advocates of Sakharov's 2005 prizes by the European Parliament, the "women in Weiss" have an unacceptable mark for the "request for the release of all political prisoners", whose number, according to the dissident list of about 200 people, is organized, Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda has been sentenced to 20 years in prison.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of which up to the date 53 are located behind bars.
The Cuban authorities feel the opponents of the regime as "Soldner" or "Agents" in the service of the declared Erzfend, the United States.
One thing is that the Cuban TV replaced the report on demonstration events that took place on Thursday between military pro-government fighters and "controversials".
Cuba, led by a Party of the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of opinion.
Hemorrhaging kills eight-year-olds with the knife and left 5 wounded in Clicky-la-garenne
A two-month-old gunman killed an eight-year-old man in the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Houts-de-Sine) and wounded five others on Friday against midnight.
According to the first statement of the inquiry, 28-year-old attackers had wounded the eight-year-olds for an unexplained reason in or before an apothecary on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two months, and this, according to police reports, was in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, was responsible for the police union Alliance in the hospital for the consequences of his injuries.
In or before the same apothecary, he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the three-siggers, has been attacked and injured.
The first two victims were taken seriously into the hospital, where the eight-year-old died.
The other victim is in danger of being subjected to life-threatening life-threatening bodies following police sources.
The pregnant woman has become pregnant as a result of the events and should have been hospitalized by a police source after being in shock.
The armed man who appears to be following police reports of alcohol or drug influence should also be on the road, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He had hurt two other passengers, apparently coincidences: a three-year-old and a four-year-old, later on from both of them.
The scenario stayed in the dark at night.
He was armed with two fishing measles, which he crossed behind the back, declared before Arnaud Pressé, a member of the trade union Alliance of the area of the skin-de-sein.
Several passengers, including young people, should, according to the AFP's reports, have tried to release their hearts.
I saw a guy in the triangles with a green west.
Three young people trying to get involved.
They didn't create it because the guy was well built, reported Alberto, a waiter of a nearby bar.
A cord fell on him, he added, among other things, a city police officer who broke his arm.
Still at the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of house number 61, two city police officers, including her predecessor, tried to arrest the armed man and were beaten with knives, so police data.
The event took place in one of Clichy-la-garennes, where there are a number of businesses.
The passengers have come to me to tell me there's an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I brought her in first-aid position and noticed a clumsy wind in the stomach area, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old apothecary, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about three-year-old, was injured by cut wounds.
The use of the State police has finally taken over the man who did not carry any papers.
The government of Nanterre has commissioned the district report of the Criminal Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) with the case statement.
The washing machine has been hospitalized on Thursday evening.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been brought to justice.
A police source does not conclude that it is being delivered into a nervous facility.
According to another police source, six police officers had to arrest him at the police station in Clichy, where he was executed.
He is "in a state of over-rearing" as "all spiritual suspects of this kind, in which the forces are released during the Father's presence".
USA: Polish Law requires re-establishment of criminal proceedings
The law lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has asked again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to bring down the punishment against his agents who are currently in his residence in Switzerland because of a court hearing over 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, director of the "Pianist", has made serious procedural errors in the second district of California in 1977 before three judges of the Court of Appeal.
I would like to refer to the position of finerless, said Mr Hummel, before he added that the behaviour of Dr. Laurence Rittenband "was allowed to run down the back at the time of the negotiations with the case".
According to him, the - among the dead - the Richter Rittenband, before his trial, had discussed with him a state attorney who should have told him that Roman Polanski deserved a funeral -- which represented a serious procedural error.
This discussion was featured in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: followed and desired), by the question-based state attorney David Wells.
Finally, at the end of September, M. Wells had explained that the authors of the documentary film had "approached".
Mr Hummel asked the Court to initiate a process which would allow him to provide evidence for his argument.
On the other hand, the complaint has repeated the evidence already presented in the first instance, i.e. that it cannot be taken seriously into account if Roman Polanski does not appear before the Court.
The 76-year-old director was expelled from the United States in 1978, even before he announced his sentence for "unlawful sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He hasn't been traveling to the United States since then.
The deputy state attorney of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to support the negotiations".
Would you like to spread the message in this regard and even though not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other allegations that flight is an opportunity? Mrs Asama asks.
According to your opinion, "the filmmaker asks the court for a case and takes into account his authority".
One of the three judges – who now has 90 days time to make their decision – even stressed that "there are still other refugee alternatives".
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also once again demanded the abolition of the criminal procedure.
She reminded her client that it would no longer be possible for her client to be affected by any repeat of the Polanski case and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was right.
Twenty-three years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on the basis of an American port order.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to a possible delivery to the house arrest in his chalet in Gstad.
Wall Street will be bridged by the rise of the dollar and shut down without a course.
New Yorker Börse closed on Friday without a course, and even in a market that was better than expected in the United States and an increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63%, while Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
In view of the final figures available at the end of this period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The extended Index Standard & Poor's 500 is around 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106,41 points.
"Truly, the market is quite quiet," said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains very limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators, "which have helped to improve the market view on the stability of economic recovery", noted analyst Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, so it was already two months behind each other and far more than expected.
The confidence of American consumers has continued to improve significantly in December, although at 73.4 versus 67.4 last month, according to the University of Michigan Index survey.
However, the indexes were broken down by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has achieved the highest position against the euro for two months, by which ''the sectors affected by the economic situation will be pushed down," Owen Fitzpatrick, German Bank, said.
The technological values have lost something on the ground.
The obligation market has returned.
The interest rate over 10 years increased by 3,540 % on Wednesday evening by 3,482 % and the loan by 4,497 % on Wednesday night by more than 30 years.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month round through South Africa, the 112 candidates for Miss World's title will cross the last hall on Saturday to realize their dream: To be chosen for the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch it in front of a billion television.
During this great beauty fair, which is held for the second time in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already added their ticket to the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were escorted to Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model.
This was a real piece of entertainment.
Beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn were just extraordinary.
I've seen a lot of things and made every lot of experiences!' said Ms. Sierra Leone with great enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will take place on Saturday, from 17 a.m. to 15 a.m. in mid-European times, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a better country to transfer my crown.
This experience was just fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, stressing Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For young Russin, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovering of "emerging landscapes".
After a month Galas, trials, encounters with the press and Safari, the misses are now focusing on the competition.
Inderin Pooja Chopra hopes to take part in the steps of Priyanka Chopra, which was selected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai, who was selected in 1994 and became both Bollywoodstars.
It is of course the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about looking.
We're messengers from our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India joins with a broad smile.
This 59th edition with music and dance will then be underlined by the organizers.
The candidates define in traditional ways and do not forget in the bathroom.
The presentation is presented by a television moderator, Angela Chow, from the former South African beauty office, Michelle McLean, and a representative of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is wise to receive the world with a little overcrowded heart and pride, as assurances Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, have made a Safari, visiting the famous Township in Soweto, but this time it costs the bike and the local kitchen.
However, it was quite unusual to meet with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand.
Not usually for a head of state, noted Ms. Sierra Leone.
However, your most beautiful memory is undoubtedly the release in Kapstadt (South West) to the football championship in June 2010, a kind of country to buy something more for this event.
I'm trafficked with people I could probably never approach otherwise.
I'll be back with security for the 2010 World Championship. Miss Italy, Alice Tacichi, likes a deal.
The news of Johnny Hallyday is according to his son David "very positive"
The news to Johnny Hallyday are "very positive", David assured his son on Friday when he arrived at the airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who has been there for a few days in the hospital.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's running very well, David Hallyday of the press said when he got out of the plane, where he arrived shortly after 13 local time (21 MEZ) from Paris.
The son of the singer, who was impressed, assured him that he would be "faster" in the Cedars-Sinaï hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was introduced to Paris on Monday because of a bacterial infection following an operation on a band discotheque on November 26.
The singer "has been placed in Los Angeles this night in an artificial coma to alleviate his severe pain and to perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles to an artificial coma where he was transferred to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up to a band disc operation.
The singer had to undergo surgery again from midnight on Thursday night because of the changes caused by the last seizure.
His wife, Laeticia, participated in a school event in the French Gymnasium of Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade went to school, a photographer of the AFP was found.
The head of the department for orthopaedic and traumatic surgery at the Hospital Pitié-Salpètriere, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The manufacturer has seriously charged the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who performed the song at the International Clinic of the Park Monceau in Paris on November 26.
We were told he set up the purest masker.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were fully equipped, Mr. Camus said.
I heard that perhaps a court procedure would be initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday is "too fast and this has been done with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I called this doctor personally, who assured me that he viewed this trip as totally unproblemable, but I was very surprised because I had already had two band disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced at RTL that the singer seemed to have left the hospital after the operation "without Dringage, without All".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in the art environment.
He had the actor Marie Trintignant, who operated a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuily-sur-Seen, where he practiced at this time.
In 2007, he also operated by actor Charlotte Gainsburg to rescind a hematom after brain bleeding.
However, he is also a doctor with a suspicious call who has already been sentenced several times because of mismanaged operations and not to forget, due to tax delays and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Chamber of Doctors, has called him "a man without scratch" who has been "regular" before the Chamber's president and is "all other than recommended."
After a few days of the skiing Dr. Stéphane Delajoux released a statement on his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This stated that the intervention would be "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would be "normal".
The operation "did not take any blood before it and therefore did not require any drawage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have taken place since last summer, seems to be a question.
It is quite clear from the hand that it is too close for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), said Mr. Camus.
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) party will be energetic and urges the party Nouveau Centre to no longer use its seal
The party association, which is monitored by François Bayrou's MoDem Party, has responded strongly to a survey of the victory, first founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, by the President of the party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and urges him to use this victory no longer under trial.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, since he is of the opinion that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had reached his left hand.
The Defence Minister, whose partner is UMP, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
As a result of his efforts, he had received the support of the Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now with NC), who claimed the ownership of the UDF brand, since he first applied for this brand in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propieté industriale".
However, the business place of François Bayrous's friends monitored the party association UDF and made it clear that they were not suitable and set a deadline for not using this seal and transfer the property rights of the brand.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would suggest your political movement, the UDF seal + acquisition+, the party association wrote in one of 19 of the 24 officers signed letters, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Zentristic Alliance.
You may also have believed that you had the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, Slogans+ of today's UDF+, on their political material as well as on your website.
As you know, you have no access to the use of this seal, declared the UDF's business site and asked the NC party "to immediately remove the name UDF from all material as well as from (her) website".
In addition, it was asked by Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property rights of the brand to their legal claim rights".
If you refuse this, we will raise a complaint against you to pay attention to the Law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In her letter, she emphasizes that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978 and recalls that Morin and his friends "have won the election" in 2007 to create a competitive movement, as others have already done in 2002 to create the party "UMP".
The Nouveau Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF seal (Union pour la democracité française).
They also recall that the last UDF 2007 Congress approved the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a business site to protect "the material and moral interests" of the movement based on Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
What Hervé de Charette wants, the business continues, "where he has been asking for the name of the brand, no longer has been a member of the UDF for three years" but the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and misleading way from the lack of the interpretation of the UDF acronym to do this for himself.
Continue to think that this invisibility is the best way to turn into a punishment, and ironize the NC's strategy: "It seems to us, however, in politics as well as in life, to make ourselves a name instead of trying to come from anonymity by resorting to a dishonest way to a name that has no legal basis."
Case Liliane Bedencourt : François-Marie Banier is convicted of being abused by weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to evaluate the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether he has used a weak moment of the eight-year-olds to facilitate a part of his ability as the daughter of the Millionaire Liliane Bettencourt.
On 15 and 16 April 2010, the 62-year-old photographer who is known for his photo will have to be charged with a fine of not more than three years and a fine of EUR 375.000 because of his lack of justice.
This decision means that there will actually be a process in this case which is worthy of the Saga of one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter are pregnant and at the same time have the wheels of the L'Oréal cosmetics.
However, the 15th Trial Chamber also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, jointly performed by three doctors.
The Erbin and Chief Activist of L'Oréal have so far refused to undergo such an investigation, in particular not under the conditions laid down by the government of Nanterre.
The doctors appointed on Friday should still submit a report before 10 March 2010 in which you clearly know whether and at what time Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she'll be doing this research.
I'll talk to her, the lawyer from Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kijeman, said after the trial.
As far as Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner is concerned, he is very satisfied with the decision of the Court.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady who needs to be protected, he confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has filed a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artists and accused him of using her mother's weakness for years in order to alleviate a billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt had always objected to being manipulated by the photographers she viewed as a long-term friend.
Although the court had to check the admissibility of the complaint filed by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the plaintiffs of lawyers led to a large family retreat on Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt appealed to three of his clients to letters sent to her notar (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she had lost the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
Françoise has never been able to speak again since her marriage."
The government administration of Nanterre is again of the opinion that the complainant had no right to respond, especially since a presidential judge has rejected his application in the last days to initiate a judicial procedure against his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is completely legal, is not protected and has no precedent.
No one has the right to act in their place," confirmed the representative of the State Administration, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court has now decided to issue a judgment after the procedure for the authorisation of Mr Bettencourt-Meyers has been carried out.
The manager revolution or the end of the strategic morning statement?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French company has been our struggle for the development of economic intelligence ...
For over a decade, the management of large companies in relation to its employees, the position of vis-à-vis the consumer in front of the marketing revolution said: "values" for the staff is the best thing to do with consumer products designed by the technicians in the work.
By putting the customer at the centre of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies for the conquest of the markets in place ... although the authoritarian test products separate factors Customer preferences are to be re-connected regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demolition.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tops of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative effect on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of F&Eund, which is even more decisive than those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economice = economic intelligence) calls for "proactive action by all parties involved (...) and a future-oriented approach"; it calls for the staff to take an approach that fully contradicts the instructions of the Authority.
This is why we call for a business revolution that would result in placing employees at the centre of the company's investments equally entitled to the customers.
The very conditional use of internal questions
Are the internal questions of opinion, how has the questionnaire, the orange, exposed its beneficiaries, addressed this revolution in relation to the management practice?
I was scared, I'm sorry.
First of all, because I was able to determine that the whole addition, in view of a new situation after many reasons, finally reaches out to do so, first of all, what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power proportions takes over the importance of its own failure.
Finally, because most driving forces have a very simple idea of human behavior.
Progress from the great engineering schools is their interpretation of psychology mechanically.
It takes by intellectual comfort the old behaviorist theory, which was recently reactivated by the American "Neurosciences" and was largely spread by research institutions and the media.
So and by suggesting that it is possible to engage the "Hebel" (sic) for the engagement of employees, a current Le Figaro.fr survey by Ipsos reinforces the leadership forces in a position to a mechanical control system that is not suitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, a necessary revolutionary revolution for the free functioning of modern companies presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists of incorporating a basic protocol in any interpretation or practice of control: for the recipient, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to realize part of its dreams, its dignity and its purposes.
Currently, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take this concept of the motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a given Doxa that allows them to appreciate what it offers them to achieve their purpose in life.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, companies can control, predict and prevent their "social performance" driving forces and re-place their human resources management at the right place.
They thus create a productive soil that is useful for the agreed development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The words of Oslo: the "righteous war" brings Obama Lob from the right
On Friday, American rights welcomed Barack Obama's speech last night in Oslo and was pleased that the 2009 Peace Nobel Prize protected the concept of "just war" against the enemy of the United States.
The conservatives who missed the award to Obama on 9 October appealed this time to the president's speech, such as the former vice-president candidate Sarah Palin in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, explained Palin, the face of the right flight of the Republican party in the newspaper USA Today and added that she herself had brought into the language the subject of a "sometimes" war in her own published memoirs.
The war is of course the last of which I think Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, they say.
Obama, who fought two wars by his predecessor George W. Bush, fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of violence on Thursday in Oslo; one way and one way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the opinion that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former President of the House of Representatives welcomed the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, this speech has appeared as historically, Ginrich, who was asked in the "The Takeway" radio station.
The previous rapporteur, who was considered by some as potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said he was pleased to see a "President of the Left" who reminded members of the Nobel Committee that "they could not be free and could not afford a price for peace if the use of violence did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former author of George W. Bush and mid-time editor at Washington Post, Obama has kept "a very American talk".
In addition, as a cosmopolitan, he has "always done it", he has spoken "as an American president", as he pointed out that Europeans "live as if they didn't create themselves and don't do much for their protection," says Gerson.
Among the few, unconfirmed rights, former UN messenger John Bolton, a falk of Ára Bush, described on the website of the National Review Online as "long, high-end and inspirationless".
On the left hand of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the return to the fighting forces.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, the massacrer can easily justify the innocent, he warns.
However, the press on the appropriate links continues to be praised by the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still the view that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, named the interview itself for a speaker like him who is known for his talent as "Memory work".
The speech in Oslo "supplys a run-up plan to control international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", says the California daily newspaper.
The New York Times is the view that Obama "advertised the necessary discourse" and named his speech as "dark and exemplary at the same time".
Driver: Three Marathons for an agreement that ensures care for Christmas
After a three-week negotiations Marathon, the trade unions of the road band and the TLF - the only organization of workers that remained until the end - ended on Friday to an agreement that ends the strike order and the devastating heavy supply pass to Christmas.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, the State Secretary for Transport Dominique Bussereau welcomed the agreement which was signed on Wednesday after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiations broke out early in the morning in hopes that the agreement would be signed early on the afternoon.
And although the three employees (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the conference.
However, it took more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 until the end of the agreement and only at 18:00 was signed.
The conflict "would have added much damage to the company" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holiday at the end of the year," says Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in pay for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest pay groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages therefore rises from €8.72 to €9.06.
"That's not very much, but we just started small," said Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now indicated not to block the supply centres anymore.
"But it is likely that there will always be some adversaries who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
The TLF President Philippe Grillot spoke of "good agreement", although it was "hard to make these increases in international competition".
As a result, the increase is at EUR 170 per month for the lower and between EUR 100 and EUR 120 for the high pay groups.
"This agreement is based on a healthy human understanding and respect for the employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), where Thierry Customs (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement".
In this regard, Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke of "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3 % and the maintenance of the overall road transport agency in the first half of 2010, which will in particular enable it to address the 13-month maintenance and modernisation of tariff contracts.
Mr Busssereau recalled that "the reduction in the costs for employers of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the Government to the draft legislation of the adjusted funds for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on Friday night.
The government requires "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to be applied first to the companies associated with this organisation and then to be extended by the Minister of Labour for the whole profession.
This will be "in the shortest time" of the case, assured Bussereau.
The opposition of employees can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR link pointed to a "trafficking trade" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to pay part of the carbon tax".
The State Secretary for Transport urges us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but not to disturb the Gans-Esser on the next Christmas evenings, the Unostra regrets.
For the Association of Otre, the agreement "in the next 12 months, small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry will be able to experience a great deal".
Line RER A: disturbances on this weekend, incompatibility with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the RER A line, the largest fast-track network in France for the Paris and Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, during a meeting on Friday, the second day between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (independent Paris passenger transport management), will continue to wait for the strike with their demands for payment.
At this important Christmas shopping week, no trains were available between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central route (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central route was only one of four trains ready for use.
The connection to the SNCF train was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, which forced passengers to move.
The shopping cart Galeries Lafayette, which counts every day 200,000 customers, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect large businesses with traffic techniques".
The RER A line runs through the Paris Balling Room from West to East.
The street section of the RATP connects the places Saint-German-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of the two trains traveled planned to the main road time, and almost none during the long journey.
As already on Thursday there was no public toilet on the roads, as the inhabitants of Île-de-France had settled in the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less than otherwise, especially because of the lack of Gymnasians.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nkwana, engineer (29), stated that he would "resurrection a few hours earlier to come to work at the moment".
The SNCF, which had planned to take care of the passengers by staff and order forces, showed that it had not been in the Saint-Lazare train station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Hout came or went from the Saint-Lazare train station to ensure access to the Metros there.
On Saturday and Sunday, major meetings of the strikers took place again, while the results were reviewed, which had taken place after the meeting with the lead point on Friday as "required".
The RER business manager proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for line RER A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers etc.
However, this is not what drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (South), they demand a long-distance payoff.
The CGT was impressed that the RATP itself put its own proposals for pay and stressed that the lead point "was not able to solve a problem while this was possible for the distancers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting was planned for "extensive testing of working conditions" for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend driver".
On Monday, about 150 drivers sought the release of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the driving point which until date allowed every discussion during the strike, and a meeting followed by an improvement in the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand itself after an announcement by Usa and Independents on the RER B line.
The associations require an increase of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South and Independents), and they also regret the deterioration of working conditions on this route, which are on the way to millions of passengers per day.
The drivers of the RER line, which have over years of professional experience, relate to a gross amount of EUR 2,200 to 2,700 and a fine of EUR 600 to 650 for skiing services and Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish Constitutional Court dissolved the pro-Curdian Party. Decision with severe consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the resolution of the country's pro-Curdian main party; a decision followed by a decision on demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision makes it extremely difficult for the government to work hard to reach the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the 25 years of conflict.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it became a "city of activities which are detrimental to the independence of the State and its divisible unit," said President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kilic four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would be made unanimously by 11 judges, where a majority of seven votes would be required to hold the resolution, and he pointed out that 37 of the party's leadership forces, including President Ahmed Turk and MP Aysel Tugluk, have been excluded for the duration of five years from the political case.
Furthermore, the judge announced the suspension of parliamentary immunity, the Turkish and the Tugluk, and the confiscating of the party's interests.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (from 550).
The chairpersons appeared before the ruling that Parliamentarians would prefer to leave the Parliament rather than take part-time parliamentarians.
In 2007, the decision was followed by a procedure initiated by the Federal Court of Justice of the Turkish Republic Abdurahman Yalcinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "indications" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) which will be considered by Ankara and many other countries as terrorist organisations.
A number of observers are the view that the DTP is the legal window of the PKK rebels.
The party ensures "no connection" to the PKK, however, refuses to appoint them as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The judgment of the Constitutional Court is the function of the Government between the aim of opposing the Kurdish Community and proposing a number of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to allow the support of the PKK to be extended by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirmed that a resolution could lead to a re-examination of tensions in South-East Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against PKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to contact with the police during the past weeks.
Since the Court's announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of DTP's spaces in the millions of Diyarbakir city in the south, mostly inhabited by Kurden.
When the demonstrants began to shoot Molowcocktails and stones, the order forces set in.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
According to the judgment, Turkey stated that the decision of the Court would "increase further confusion".
"Turkey can't explain this question ( Kurdish, etc.) under the ban of a party," he said.
The Government, consisting of a party that has been committed by the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose principle against the conclusion of the parties.
This doesn't solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedoes of the democratic opening promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously stick to a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK became known as an attack on which seven soldiers arrived in northern Turkey three days ago. It was one of the most brutal attacks of the past month.
The use of snow may occur
A really cool winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to get rid of the citizens, says the FES's Winter Service Leader.
However, so that his staff can test and control the entire vehicle technology.
It could be the first time on the weekend according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this regard, the FES is following a specific plan.
As soon as there is a flat ceiling in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A routes will be taken off with large motor vehicles, Braubburger explains.
This includes the main traffic and transit routes such as the new road and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also firewalls, ÖPNV routes, pedestrian areas and tracks with cases such as the Atselberg Street.
The FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometres should be rounded up for maximum three hours with a fatty salt that is better attached.
The FES therefore starts at three o'clock in the evening, "so that the roads are free until the traffic begins".
It'll be hard if it's only 7:30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service director, "because then nobody's ready to take the train place".
Only then, if it does not cut again, are supply and exit routes, including the Council-Beil Street, on the line.
The last priority has side and side roads.
There will be complaints, white Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning, the people of the FES are on their way, driving points and overhangs.
In any way, the FES can't be worried.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps the bridges in front of us from 22 to 4.30 hours, says Braubuer.
As it gives on this quick glazing, it is as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the current goes down.
If necessary, this will also be called by the police.
The Wages of Dinosaur
Tawa hallae appeared like many other flimsy dinosaurs: The two meters long and 1,50 meters big animal loved on two strong back legs, had a long wound with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with wheelchairs and a long jaw.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it wouldn't have been special.
However, Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, Sterling Nesbitt reported from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived some 215 million years ago in modern New Mexico, which was then located in a dry zone of the supercontinent of Panghea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window for early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbit says.
It shows us much about the relationships, the expansion and characteristics of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began with a recording on the Ghost Ranch in North New Mexico.
Sometimes we have found a dozen dinosaur bones on a day, which is for example for crew crews from the Trias, team member Randall Irmis reports from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
In the course of the excavating, they brought together the rest of the total of five individuals.
Found confirmed theories about Dino breakfast history
The name "Tawa" comes from the Sunset of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an extraordinary fund: "Dinosauri fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, most of which only one piece is found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share enthusiastism.
This fund is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current theory, dinosaurs were first born some 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are incomplete, which is why the order of this ur-dinos is mostly disputed.
The experts are therefore discussing, for example, when the Ecstasians emerged in their three main developmental lines: the frescoeding theropodes, which were later known as the tyrannous rex, the velociraptor, and also the birds known as the "long-lived" sauropodens and their relatives, and the plants emerging from Ornithischia (vogelbeken saurier), which were members of the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is an original therapist.
He shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, Nesbitt says.
In the ruins of Tawa hallae, researchers found, for example, references to airbags, as well as the trails of the therapists, the birds.
Thanks to the air jacket, the smell of birds is more efficient than that of the mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the grape juice were also partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive thermopode with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the associated line of the huge sauropodens later included also airbags and light-building knots, this useful innovation was probably already the common process of both groups.
At least three migration waves to North America
Since the most well - known dinosaurs have lived in South America for the first time, researchers believe that the Ecs were born there for the first time.
As a result, the three development lines were separated early and spread out from South America over all parts of the world, which were still a single country mass of overcontinent Panghea.
The fact is that the team, together with Tawa, had the rest of the other two, did not find particularly closely related therapists.
The three cannot stem from a common immigration procedure, the researchers argue.
We believe there are at least three migration wells in North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-founder of the science study.
There are also objections for freedom.
Another older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in Poland today, says the Bonner Paláontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be a distorted picture because in South America many primitive dino fossils have just been obtained, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
As the dinosaurs were created to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the Reptilinism to the ruling agricultural animals of the earth age, it is still justified.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their living room with many other reptiles, for example with the practice of present-day crocodiles and flyguarantee and many other species.
At the end of the Trias, dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the linkage between the Trias to the Jura border ended.
Success History Does Not Go On Forever
There are two hypotheticals to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that would eventually survive the dinosaurs, but the other reptiles would not.
Or the dinosaurs were better suited so they could win the competition from the field.
In any case, success history did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite attack on a group of animals that had also developed in the Trias and since then completed a squattenase: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to São Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors of the University of Toronto are at the University of Cambridge, the Uni Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
Dozens from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police space of the occupied casino of Frankfurt Goethe University is killing waves around the world.
278 professors and teachers of Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarity with the protesting students at Campus Westend.
In a statement in German and English, "missible" they wrote the police service carried out by the Bureau.
Uni President Werner Müller-Estler had left room for buildings occupied by students and doctors in the education area last week, as walls and works of art were covered.
Five students were injured.
The charges, which the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organised teaching events by students and teachers by a police command".
The space is an "non-acceptable entry" into the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism is "the delegitization and criminalization of the protest" and link to its content.
The Bureau rejected the necessary discussion.
The doctors require the immediate establishment of criminal proceedings.
Most of the owners did not support the damage, that is.
Protest legitimately justified
The young people of the Verdi Association and the German Association are also solidarity with the students.
The protest is a more legitimate expression of growing concern about its own future, says green-land youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen's Ministry of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the leadership of the Unipresitor and the police.
We are grateful to the Vice-President.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in Wiesbaden's day.
We have understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, as is the CDU-Landday Officer Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition groups saw SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls to the front to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Links).
Instead of contrasting with the arguments and demands of the students, there was room.
The link has submitted an application which calls on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police service.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years it has been considered a secret city for Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a strictly guarded place for secret research in the Soviet Union.
Today the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the Moscow centre, is known as "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production sites for micro and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogras had contacted Frankfurter Sciences Centre Riedberg - with the Union institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Centre for Innovation (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday now Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for Single Cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow vice-president, Juri Rosljak and President Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd, led the Russian delegation to sign for Frankfurt plans Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It's a continuous scientific exchange.
But it's also about economic relations.
Companies of the FIZ will be able to catch up on the growing Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies want to undertake contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of significant Russian research institutions and companies.
This includes the Moscow Institute for Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronics.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Plant City" for Russian research.
Selenograd (meanly translated "Grennstadt") received his name from the government of the hillland in which the research facilities are located.
Stuttgart Bremsklotz
The size of Stuttgart 21 cannot be sufficiently high.
For the sponsors of the project it is bad and simply "the new heart of Europe".
That's right. S21 is much more than the depth of a railway station, more than a monster construction project, which will be destroyed by the city of Baden-Württemberg Country Capital for a decade in an inexhaustible construction camp.
Stuttgart 21 was created from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headway ports with bridges that end in the city were then considered to be a traffic-technical fossil of the 19th century, which acted as the brake keys of modern rail traffic, since it took quite a lot of time to turn vans from behind.
Just drive, hold on, keep going - so go.
And that's why the main roads should be destroyed: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a railway station located about half of the trans-European rail disciplines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - which is why the slogan of "Lord Europe".
S21 is now actually under way, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have found that it is almost impossible in the Hessian and Bavarian capital to implement the deeper understanding.
However, there are no problems with driving and driving since there are modern trains with driving vehicles and driving cars at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 is now being launched in addition to the ICE newline to Ulm.
It has been carried out by national and municipal policymakers.
The road is also affected by the risks of the largest single infrastructure project in the Republic of the taxpayer and not of the state companies.
The project can be justified in a number of ways.
There is a new city area, which - you believe the computer-generated graphs of the planner - are equipped with lots of greens.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The railway station and the road construction have been designed for the traffic of people, which has been written by a man - typically 80 years of age - a huge growth.
At that time there was no competition for the ticketer.
Modern transport policy must, however, firstly, strengthen freight transport because transport on the rail is much more environmentally friendly than per Lkw on the road.
However, the new strain does not work because of severe increases in quality training.
It's even more serious that S21 is indirectly tanning many other railway projects.
Good six billion euros should be prohibited in Switzerland.
That's the official number.
Experts hold ten to 15 billion for realistic.
It is established that in the next decade the money will be missing at other nodes and angles in the network.
All six major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of the good 180 km long route through the Rhinetal.
Since 1987 it has been built on the road in time-period timer.
It would be urgent to press right here on the tube.
But S21 will work as a brake lock.
The rail line will be at the top of the bottle for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
The Government shall verify the court of the airport
The Government of the Netherlands has opened on Wednesday on whether it will be reviewed against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) for the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP Coalition has commissioned experts to review the VGH section of more than 400 pages legally, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel on this day had written grounds that the country should re-regulate the night flight ban in the case of the construction of the planned Northwest Land Railway in Frankfurt Airport.
The permit of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as provided by the Government of the country, is not to be agreed with the legal protection of the population before nighttime.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it is against the Court of Auditors.
The opposition criticised this resignation and urged the government to reject a review at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD Group Chief Torsten Schäfer-Güffer called for CDU and FDP to return to their pre-selective agreements to a night flight ban. Otherwise, it would be considered "wordbreak".
It's fucking hard if one can keep his word, Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in play on the FDP election log "We hold the word".
Minister Posch showed back the draft of the Säfer-Gümbel, which the government is trying to get to their night flights with "Justice and Trickserei" yet.
A precise legal test requires their time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a more secure decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, the statements of his group on the night flight ban have never been made.
U.S. Banks to pay back Help
The crisis-protected U.S. large banks are breaking down their state bonds.
The Bank of America has paid the aid from the Tarp Banking Fund at a total of $45 billion (good 30 billion).
And the Citigroup also plans to return State aid after a report by the US Ambassador CNBC.
The institutions therefore want to remove the restrictions which have been imposed with the adoption of the money – such as the limitation of the payment of managerboni and the fixing of higher fees.
The Bank of America had been well-equipped with 19 billion dollars of fresh money from investors.
The rest of the sum was taken out of its own box, which was, inter alia, well filled by the sale of spare parts.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis expressed his gratitude to the American taxpayer on Wednesday: the money prizes have helped over a very difficult time.
The cash house had risen to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to make money on the capital market to be freed from its obligations to the State.
Already on Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce about 20 billion dollars of heavy capital, reported CNBC on circuits.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to go out.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Quick Select
Then everything went faster than you thought.
Almost two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had forced the former chief editor Nicholas Brander from the office, the sender may present a successor.
Last night the Gremium wanted to vote for the staff.
As a favorite, Peter Frey, director of the ZDF headquarters studio in Berlin.
However, there was no official confirmation from the sender in order not to prejudge the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role in not further harming ZDF-intent Marcus Schachter, and this proposal should not be carried out by the Governing Council.
Frey, treasurer candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members.
The results of the vote were not yet established at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schacher and his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years was divided into the Administrative Council.
Only seven members spoke out for Brander, seven voted against him. Branders Abwahl was a severe subterranean, but an expected one.
Because the majority of the Union in the board of directors had already signaled weeks before the election, not wanting to confirm Brander in the office.
He organized the opposition against the Chief Editor of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that, under Brander, ZDF's communications had been lost to injecting quotas, he left another office of the head of the high-ranking editor.
Until recently before the election there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF has been suspended.
Finally, even 35 national lawmakers had joined in the debate, who considered the past as constitutionally constitutional.
It doesn't have anything to do with it.
Personal
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogical and Romantic.
Then he worked at the South West Funk and at the Frankfurt Roundshaw.
In 1983 Frey changed to ZDF, first to today's journal.
Follow-up stations: 1988 to 1990 of the Chief Editor's Personal Referendum; 1991/92 Correspondent in Washington; until 1998 Director and Moderator of the "Morgen magazine"; until 2001 ZDF Head of External Policy; since the Head of the ZDF Capital Studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the Abwahl Brenders, who was still elected by the media magazine to the journalist of the year on Wednesday.
Kochs Rederpart of the Governing Council, President Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF Treaty so that staff proposals of the intention cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, an increase of party politicians from the supervisory branches of the ZDF has also been made by Beck.
Branders' prospective successor Peter Frey had recommended to the Board of Directors with a clear shock - by strongly criticising the Gremium immediately after the Brander Abbahl.
Thanks to this strong journalist independence, he was able to nominate both his faceless shoulders for the posts of the chief editor and the board of directors, without any suspicion of having a participant in the office.
Frey is listed in the partyarithmetics without the left-handed.
The study will be completed
Partly for the students: After one year of education, the Minister of Culture of the Countries finally joined on Thursday: at a meeting of the Minister of Culture and Higher Education Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
The students should be able in the future to manage their studies as well.
In each case they agreed to reduce the test load: In principle, each study module should only end with a single test.
In addition, the work load of the students should be checked and "a realistic and representative measure".
Policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to more flexible design of common structural standards for Bachelor and Master Studies.
In addition, different national arrangements should not be provided.
Lower tests
Since the beginning of students' protests in June, the Minister of Culture and Uni Rectors have taken the floor of the best student's ability to speak.
Now it was first filled with a specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Board decided to partially reduce the number of tests: "Every module usually concludes with only one test", in a 30-page paper which should re-regulate the approval of students.
With the "significant reduction of the test load", the Accreditation Board President, Reinhold Grimm, stated that a "frequency development content which significantly affected the studyability" should be offered.
In addition, the "studyability" should be "the decisive criterion" for design in the future.
Modules such as content should be "extremely checked" if "unnecessary consents of students when selecting the
It would prevent events."
The students had "Required to get toys to enable and promote their own initiatives".
The rules should be valid for the authorisation, but also for the verification of existing studies.
These must be "recredited" every five years – however, this means that it will take up to 2015 until all studies have been checked.
It is up to ten accreditation agencies which are in charge of the accreditation Council by the countries.
The Ministers of Culture had called on the countries in October "with pressure" to influence agencies that dustfills are not too large and the testing regime is not too strict.
In certain German countries universities and universities have already agreed with the ministries of the country on appropriate measures.
As a single country so far, Rheinland-Pfalz said additional resources for the further development of the Bologna process.
In particular, higher education and training programmes should be set up in the form of money, and study advice and audit and foreign agencies should be strengthened.
Countries and universities want to use 10 million euros for this.
In early 2010, the Government wanted to introduce a novel of the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
Only one test should be required for the conclusion of a study model.
The study design should be more flexible, as well as the recognition of performance evidence at other universities and facilitate access to the master.
By the end of the coming year, all studies in the country should be checked on their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and opposition had again challenged the study conditions in the country.
In addition to Lob there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal President of the Juso High School Groups asked that the development of education policy should no longer take place "in closed doors" by ministers and higher education sectors in the future.
At least after the course of education, students should now also "intervene a word".
The future academics received support from the President of the High School Rector Conference (HRK), Margaret Wintermantel: "We need students' experiences," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Culture Ministers, with which the HRK advises on a joint reform paper.
In general, the Bonner's decisions did not go far enough: it calls for a legal claim that allows each graduate with a Bachelor's conclusion to have access to a further master's study.
On the other hand, the countries need to ensure that there are sufficient master courses available for today's generation of Bachelor students tomorrow, with the best study conditions available, as GEW member Andreas Keller.
The countries must clearly set up more doctors.
However, the Minister of Culture did not hesitate to offer free access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering in Germany and out there is almost no control... "the initial line of a myth of the Lyrics Werner Sulner, in which the experience of a dissident who has won freedom but has also lost his language space.
In 1951, Werner Søllner, who was born in the Romanian Banat, first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's bookstore, before he moved to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurter poetic lectures at Goethe University, and has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Moison Tower in Frankfurt since 2002.
He took care of the past Tuesday at a meeting in Munich, where he went on to "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of its security acts".
Søllner is clearly assured and loyal to a statement in which he made his work as an IM for the Romanian Secret Service Security.
Together with some of the participants, Søllner had received the German language price in 1989.
The application tests had begun badly, first in 1971.
I'm, close to Süllner, "so someone who didn't threaten to take care of the security test."
The Lyriker Werner Selner is IM Walter.
At the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its unambiguous literary representation with the mechanisms of dictatorial governance, the literature chain, and in particular the community of German authors coming from Romania, will be affected by a case which will make known the reasons and the subjection of a political system, which will be based on monitoring and inspection.
Werner Søllner is so far from being known, not only father, but also victim.
In his Security Act, IM Walter has played a role, said after the opinion of Søllner of the literature scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter on him.
He's got him in all difficult points for him at the time, Markel.
It would be a moral necessity for him to make this observation.
The same statement was unexpected in form and before this publication, however, it is not surprising that the identity of an ex-dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not known.
If Germany had been a comfortable reserve for safety tips, Herta Müller had already written in July, after reading its own document, 914 pages.
In some cases, the people concerned may be confused and may also have known which name is hidden behind the cover names Sorin, Voicu and Walter too.
Unlike in this country, the treatment of behind the security surveillance teams is still very widespread among the very professional perspectives of the Stasi acts.
A systematic explanation has been pursued and hampered in recent years.
One of the Birthler authorities of the National Council for the Establishment of the Security Acts (CNSAS) was founded only in 1999, but the issue of the Acts had been rather slow.
Since 2005, there has been a law governing the administration of the acts.
Since the influence of former security members in Romania is still very high, an interview was conducted after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which an former chief of security from Temesvar resigned from the prize winner.
She's got a psychosis, and finally she's been heard once.
The infamity of power here meant that it was absolutely unsatisfying in the form of freedom of opinion.
Certain issues are related to the case of Saltner, as often as related to minor debts.
The particular reaction of the audience to Søllner's knowledge can hope that the continuation of this chapter will be better determined by knowledge rather than by education and shame.
For the generation of Herta Müller's work, which was opposed to the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Addendum to the Championships League
It seemed as if there were just an adrenalined outdoor servicer from a very nice Christmas party on which a sports artist Goodies had shared when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange-coloured plastic sheet of the equipment, went up one quarter after midnight into a re-enacted C-class.
The man with the brand-new glass was allowed to run away because of the other foreign city.
Otherwise he could also drive himself - alcohol was not in the game at all, and before luck was exactly less than 55 years of age.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow's work goes on.
Or just let it go.
In the words of the first three days before Switzerland's commitment: "We have reached the end", i.e. in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we cannot hide from success: There will be a brutal struggle against the decline."
The "very important task" is before Sunday.
Then it is appropriate to resume the king's performance in Mainz on the Liga All Day.
And the weaknesses clearly revealed after the quick three doors through Marica (5), the grass (8) and the Pogrebnyak (11).
Resolution
The final final of the Champions League (Hinsplay 16./17. + 23/24 February/ Back Games 9./10. + 16/17. March) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy over the full-fledged condition of the Babel successor remained.
Not only in the common health care provider who had entrusted the unsecured Stuttgart profession with confidence in self-confidence, readiness and joy of play.
I went to the players and told them that they should think about their strengths, and had kept them, to be more courageous, explained the very sound success recipe, which under therapy Babble had no further effect.
He discovered a certain magic, gave Babel-worder Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in the football, sometimes things that you wouldn't have been able to do."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a weekend break of injury thanks to his dynamics as well as the best player on the spot, tried to describe the established "phenomam" with the speech "fresh wind" and the way the new one worked: "There is a man who needs discipline and discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
Under Babylon it was apparently lacking in this.
The VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warned sports president Horst Heldt
However, the VfB Stuttgart needs more than ever.
Like Gross, players and managers were also encouraged to overestimate the victory against a completely weakened and completely overwhelmed turnout of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow four days later in Liverkusen at 0:4 the bad awakening had made Khedira think.
And sports president Horst Heldt said that while one seasonal goal was achieved, the other was still in further distance.
We're not over the mountain yet.
That Heldt was not celebrated on his 40th birthday, even after the first home page three months after the festival, was on the events of the weekend, which were released in the form of a television interview immediately before the start of the game by Torhüter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that the others make and not the Jens, Heldt told the harsh criticism of Lehmanns.
He had challenged the board of directors' weaknesses and had decided to change the train on pressure of pubertin fans.
Also that his free day was spent after games, Lehmann was regarded as a sign of lack of sovereignty and disadvantage.
Lehmann's statements were "deduced from pure egoism", Heldt called back and announced consequences for the final man.
They may not be friends for life anymore, both forty-two years old.
However, they agreed with everyone else that without the work done by the rejected training team, it would not have been possible to have the gamerical and combative strong idea.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large part of success", said Heldt and Lehmann unisano - and also the man agreed with the plastics.
WM-Fight in heavy weight
Today's Duell in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson Worldmeister Vitali Klitschko used words and gestures again.
After 12 hard rounds, however, the Ukrainians defended his heavyweight title after the WBC version.
The judgment of the Court of Justice came out unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains World Master in heavy weight.
The 38-year-old champion after the WBC version won the US-American Kevin Johnson on Saturday night in Bern unanimously on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
The Ukrainians were already two world masters of the WBO and WBC allies.
Sorry about the K.o. that everyone's expected didn't regret.
Klitschko built his balance on 39 victories in 41 professional battles, twice he had to pay for injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first floor in the 24th fight.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Berner Arena, the 2,02 meters large Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
The 11 centimetre smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko-Ára before the duel, however, has always avoided the defeats of the Lord of the World, so Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights to a decisive end.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get through the rounds.
Although he practiced Klitschko with words and gestures, his attacks were only rare.
At the same time, he was the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went on with Klitschko about the full distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had provided for some grapes before the battle in the Swiss capital.
He betrayed Klitschko as "hapsy zombie", which "can't be right".
At the pool, the champion then volunteered on Friday to get Johnson out of the nose to "be able to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth battle after his return on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years, he had killed the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and returned to "his" WBC-Gyrtel which he had to give up before battle.
In this year he won the title of Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
In this fight I've only suffered a stroke and am physically very well in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is World Master of the WBO and IBF.
The WBA bridge, however, is led by British David Haye, who was able to detonate the 2,13 meters of the great Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had earlier launched a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September in the summer.
It seems that its promotion company is now planning the fight against Klitschko in London Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin has called Minister of Defence Guttenberg a liar for false information about the customer's business.
SPD and links require clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following the recent findings on Kunduz's air strike, the opposition Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor to Guttenberg (CSU) submitted a known shift.
The minister said about the deadly bombing on two tank trains from September "seriously the truth," Green Group chief Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD news post "Dayview".
It's called landmine: he lied.
The order to kill was given under the rules of the International Protection Corps for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had read to Mr Guttenberg said Trittin.
On Friday it was known that the attack was not only about destroying the released cargo, but also about killing two Taliban leaders.
According to the Nato investigation report, U.S. Air strike required by German Customer Commander Oberst Klein was either killed or injured up to 142 people.
Greens, SPDs and Links asked the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to immediately exit before the Federal Day and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to explain whether a strategy of the intended murder is part of the federal government's Afghan policy - and whether Chancellor, Federal War and News Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green College Renate Künast called for.
Government speaker Ulrich Wilhelm showed the criticism back.
The Canzleramt had no influence on the concrete use of the German Navy in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there was also doubt in the presentation of the Ministry on the basis of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have been correct and fully informed of the background of the tank cluster attack.
Officially, they had denied the existence of the Nato reports and kept the Minister sensitive details.
However, from the environment of the two top officials, it was reported that they had even referred to several reports by the Ministry of Defence, including a second document of the ordering Colonel Klein and a field report.
If they should have prayed in a letter to clarify the matter, the "Frankfuter General Sunday" reports.
He didn't get an answer until he got it.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not object and pointed out that this would be explained in the committee of examinations of the Bundesday which wanted to be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see in the state of alert images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental diseases and drug abuse, the boundaries between imagination and reality are disappearing.
As long as it happens in bed, it's all right.
If we are sitting in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can unmistakably present the wildest ideas and fantasy images.
However, those who experience traumatic conditions in their growth, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, usually in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addicts, at least as specializing.
However, such images and voices do not occur only in mental illness or in drug use.
The same neuronal processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, however, ensure that the boundaries between dreams, waves and reality disappear.
Dreamingly changed moods can occur in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case of Wahn.
Even if solutions and effects vary, the visions of the mystical Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shammanic withdrawal conditions, psychosis and similar processes can be traced.
Hallustion or urinary disorders occur when the weight of the neuronal fats of the brain - all in front of dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is eliminated and the interaction of different parts of the brain is interrupted.
Difficulty Hallinizations and fatigued thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The force no longer has power over him
The relationship between wine and dreams has been in the hands of philosophers and physicians since the Antique.
Aristotle considered Hallustions to be a form of sleep in the wake of the state of wake, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great similarity of iresene with dreams", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, customs training, mental exchanges of such a kind".
It is Herbst 2001, when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and quiet.
The force of gravity has no power over him no more, he floats at the room deck.
He's going to miss a meeting.
Behind him flew devillike designs with bluetose, dirty frescoes, toothbrushing.
They hunt him, they beat him with heavy, flimsy sticks, they beat him against the walls, he sucks the pain in the whole body.
Sound, bad sounds draw from walls and radio.
He can no longer raise them to the voices of mending and politifying him.
Henning T. takes two cables out of the stereo system, writes them into a sledge and connects them to a hole on the deck.
He climbs up on a voicespeaker and sits around his neck.
Springt.
The Schlings are gonna be okay.
That'll be a lesson for you, the voices cry in a noise-cracking choir, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today, Henning T. 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years, the first nearly 20 years.
It was dissolved by LSD.
His diagnosis causes schizophrenic paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the worst fear and deep confusion, he says.
The dry images are funny reality
About one percent of the population gets sick at least once in life in schizophrenia, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the most frequent post-depressive disease.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those concerned can no longer distinguish between the internal and external world, which can lead to overcrowding, size, relationship or persecution.
Especially widespread is the voice voice - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Not only are optical Hallusions rare, too.
The power involved is no longer important, the brain can no longer filter disruptive signals, the consciousness is overwhelmed by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the keys to a stream of ideas and fantasy that generate deeper consciousness stories.
The reality perception in psychosis is subjective, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Oberazt of the Clinic for General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University.
The schizophrenic is at the centre of the story, everything has a focus on it.
At the same time he plays a passive role, he becomes, like in the dream, overcome by the stories and cannot actively draw them.
Schizophrene therefore often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality equality is most not possible for them, the raw images are funny reality, excluding awakening.
Once in life to experience a hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the emotional and spatial structure of the reality that is taken into account in the psychosis remains basically achieved."
The worthy thoughts and hallucinations were in reality, and the promotion of the experience was in the real framework.
Why exactly does our brain caprioles still stand in front of us?
Exceptions can lead to short-term loss of reality, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
It seems to be genetic adjustment to schizophrenia, but twinning studies have shown that genes are not the only factors.
Researchers believe that there are minimal brain damages involved.
We suspect that neuronal resection of the brain will be interrupted in an early stage of development by a virus disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explains Fuchs.
But there remains a clue as to how the neuronal system's disorder is going to occur, which will not even manifest itself over many years.
Environmental impacts also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for a psychosis when the device is available.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also release psychosis as they penetrate the transmission system.
If our brain is hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer under their homeizations and turn off their medications to get them out of other money for drugs to get what to get, says Professor Erich Kasten, Lübecker.
Whether images are taken as acceptable or uncomfortable is often just a question of the position.
Casten has been collecting reports about Hallinizations and frauds for ten years, and last year he has evaluated his results in the book "The Real World in Our Head".
Hallinizations include the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also many other disorders.
These include mental disorders such as Borderline or depression, such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s disease and damage syndrome.
Surprisingly, hallucinated under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people.
Hallizations, such as boxes, are composed of memory content that are normally kept.
They occur when hinareals, in which sensory perceptions are processed, are overactive or are too low-pressure; when our brain is hot or if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can solve this condition just like brain damage or psychosis.
But also travel, stress, love room or other mental exclusions.
In recent studies up to a third of the respondents had at least once had a hallucination in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visiting the Gymnasium.
A very normal girl, actually.
Unless the pictures and voices were there.
In the break it can occur that a young man with long, dark hair is attracted to it.
When he is answered, the students are surprised to see it - no one else sees or hears these boys.
They keep the sweetest girl for a tense day-to-day room, but Sarah K. doesn't dream she knows.
She's awake, she's hearing and she's seeing these guys, just like she's hearing the girl in the bank next to her.
It can even smell its presence, at least for a moment.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boys.
When I'm mad, she sometimes asks herself.
But she knows that this young man and the other images are not real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are most amusing
Often, the images are also a burden.
If she sits in the classroom, she can't follow the teaching material at times because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just presenting a new fellow student, while explaining mathematical equations for all other hearing and visible.
At night, the appearances are most amusing.
When she is waiting in her dark room on the bed, which is too rare to come too late, she can often not discern whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the frescoes or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she'll break the designs.
Parents and friends tell nothing about what they'd think they'd be crazy.
Herbst 2009. Sarah K. is today 20 years old.
In the past year, she has survived the a Abitur and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallizations stopped.
Since she's been in contact with the psychologist's box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Wahn is also an art work of confusion
If a person is socially isolated or suffering from a travel trip, he is likely to have after a lot of homework, says Casten.
I suspect that the brain is then underemployed and is itself responsible for its maintenance.
Sarah K., a single child, as a little girl feared other children, often played alone.
She began her homework exercises when she learned with 13 that the man she called Papa, since she can think of, is not her loyal father.
Since visual and acoustic halls are active in the same areas of the brain, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult to distinguish images and reality such as Sarah K.
Hallinizations are also images that allow brains to develop, which is why they seem so real."
Nightly dreamed images also serve as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of health are not basically different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, mental health is able to recognize their trauma as unrealistic.
Casten therefore recommends that his patients also appreciate the Hallustions as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
In our highly conscious world, Immigrants experience is unfortunately pathology, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief of the Hospital for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, suffering disease, but it also generates positive, creatives - car is also an art work of confusion.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the so-called ioniroide experience, a particular form of mood change.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed Quasi dreams that hold the experience for real and that can't be separated from the state of growth in the neighborhood.
Ioniroide consciousness occurs in trauma or disease-related extremes, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor impairment in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by self-loss and world loss, perhaps by sustained, complete mobility ability, he replaces the life-threatening reality by a own, imaginary world that is linked to reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border status between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to deal with a situation in reality, there is a world change, but the reality is being presented in imagination.
An intense form of feeling and feeling in a situation that allows us humans to create their own, does not suffer in a state of unconsciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
The Turkish art historian Peter Cornelius Clausen also describes his one-year-old experiences in his book "Development" as a rescue action of the souls.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness begins following a heart attack operation with subsequent heart transplants on trips, while his body is judged at the intensive movement station.
Cloassen is born into a self-created world, visiting foreign times and places: He lives as a bedridden man, old man, on board a train station, a robot is waiting for his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under the adligens that produce the extracts from blood.
He is driven by a Greek on the motorcycle in his home country, surfs with his hospital bed in the heart of the Alps and meets a Korean Mafioso.
He's going to the full picture of the event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These internal journeys vary considerably from one dream to another.
Dream is another state, he describes his life.
On the contrary, I am aware of the memories of mental travel even after years and in additional details.
More clear and intense than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience spreads the horizon of our other world experiences, says Psychiater Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, show Oneiroide, Psychosis, Hallinizations and Drug Abuse, how disturbing our internal images of external reality are also in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarized by the psychological box, "can lead to a transformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be very touching.

Burda
Children should be 27 years old
The new vice president Callen is a solution: Long-termly, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told the SPIEGEL.
Holding is also expected to be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The seller Hubert Burda sees his company for a long time in the hands of his children.
Both children are 27 years old and have the firm's desire to join the company, says the 69-year-old SPIEGEL.
The details of this are carefully set out.
The question whether they are also active in the company is this.
The question is whether they are in a position to do so.
7500 employees cannot be placed in custody of their children if they are not competent enough.
This also affects the children and the company.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he had withdrawn from the president since January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Callen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Callen has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burda since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, the treasurery area was responsible for the company's assets and, after the divorce of Jürgen Höfer, also those for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, there is no family member at the top of the list.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died some years ago.
The name of Callen also means "10, 15 years to exceed", says Burda.
Holding should also be 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
Looking at the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family companies are not safe before the study: "This is always about families who are caught up in a capital search that has been fully reflected and thought they could rise to a very large player.
My strategy was not that.
He had "no world power dreams," Burda said.
I do not see myself as the political president of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play 'Time' in the world, these people have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
This is at least what El Corte Ingles has done, which recently opened a cargo shop with a area of more than 1000 m2m in Callao (Madrid), where everything is only about body care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you can find other companies, such as Hedonai, who provide for a leisure with laser; Spaxion, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the Frisaire Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitine with its natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food supply that thrives through its tea house with more than 130 different tea varieties.
A relaxing massage together with your partner and at the same time having a fantastic view of the capital, or for two hours rent the relaxation area to put your own "beauty party" with eight friends on your feet and then relax in the Whirlpool or with massages and a glass champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities that Spaxion offers.
The total area is 250 m2 which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydro therapy.
For example, for the kavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating areas.
The fitness studio also has this kind of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who care about the customer's training units and provide them with a complete personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touchscreen that is located against the devices.
Then show you various videos how you can properly perform your training units.
The director of the fitness studio ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and heating) are fully enough to train the muscles.
If you want to take care of your body once you have trained your body, the company Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments for re-emergence of hair, glanze and health for your hair are offered in a custom way.
Innovation and exclusion seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the city, which is always open from 10.00 a.m. to 22.00 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse Decolletes
Christmas is getting closer and therefore it is again a good opportunity to copy the appearance of stars and to get their tights in our dress.
The form of the Decolletés, which is very important for the promotion of the silhouette, is one of the points to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen a very complicated decolleté. From it you can only open it.
Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
The company Endesa has created the "LIVE Office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (introduction logistics) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car into the city and reach agreements on mobility by administration, coordination, subsidization, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is to be developed to support the electric car and the opinions and measures of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to move forward the means of transport in the future.
3 "Electric cities"
Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to speed up the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the autonomous Community of Catholics.
These activities involve, inter alia, activities related to energy and in particular their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative at which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in European standardisation groups and maintains a whole range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a direction of peace" for the car sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, is the Spanish car industry, which is the country's largest exporter, a "horizontal of peace".
In the submission of the 2009 Economic Report by the Presidents of the Government, Zapatero recalled once again the comments of the Government on the support of the automotive sector during the Government's year.
"Without the car industry's competitiveness plan, we had today a panorama of neglect and neglect of some of our main production works," said the President.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the car manufacturers, even in Spain in the future in a highly competitive industry, we can see a quiet horizon for the future of this industry, which is our major export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall Automotive Industry (PIA), has provided EUR 800 million for 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which have again provided more than EUR 3 billion for investment.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlines the Government's efforts to address the demand, in line with the 2000E plan, which will be applied in cooperation with the autonomous communities and car manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government , this plan allows for reducing emissions from new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6 % to the average, resulting in a "strong increase" in authorisations rising by 40 % in November.
On 20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
In Madrid the first edition of the international classic car fair is held, a exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of motors.
This event will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in Babellón de Crystal of Casa de Campo in Madrid.
In this case, 200 square metres of exhibition will be provided by domestic and foreign exhibitors.
This includes not only classical motorcycles and vehicles, but also all just memorable items related to the world of motors at the ClassicAuto Madrid.
In this way you can find exhibitors on the exhibition accessories, spare parts, components, material accessories, accessories, publications, miniaturuturatos, etc.
Hundreds of articles from the world of classic motors that are attracted by collectors and lovers.
Among the companies participating in this event are Classicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restorations; Cupe-Françoiso Pueche, sales and restoration of cars, specialising in Mercedes Benz.
Availability tests in the field of surface

It shall also be carried out in a self-adhesive race track in the area of the exhibition area with classic cars and motorcycles.
Mazda3 i Stop: Environmentally competitive sport
Mazda wants to prove that sport is compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda has recently introduced the automatic stop and take-off system of the engine, which is based on the name i-stop, but currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of Mazda 3 comes up with its good notes in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its payoff behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
At the front seats it can be found that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good behaviour.
In addition, the game of the left-hand wheel is excellent.
In further consideration of the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the armature board, it can be found that Mazda is red and blue with a variety of buttons and buttons in the above-mentioned colors, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us in part of the Honda Civics style.
It can therefore be said without further saying that both the Mazda 3, as well as the Civic, both Japanese models, are of the importance of the German car, especially of the Volkswagen Golf, which wants to overcome all.
The airway of these two Japanese compact vehicles offers more than any suitable comfort, so that four adults can drive more easily with the car.
For all of this there is an enchanted and well-formed coffee room.
The stop and start system is available only for the 2 litre of petrol engine with 150 PS and a 6-wheel drive.
This engine is a real pleasure. It is built up by its fineness, by its low noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who don't drive many kilometers a year should take into account this i-stop with petrol engine because of its gross comfort in driving and its low consumption, even if in Mazda, above all the diesel models are most sold.
With regard to equipment, the so-called sportive model chosen for the test is a specialty because it has a significantly higher number of elements from the series equipment.
The series equipment consists mainly of the driver switch (RVM), which will trigger the dead angle, but also the handling elements for the traction and stability, the speed system, the light-sensitive interior, the board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, the Bluetooth and the damaged 17-inch flow.
In addition, this version also includes, if it is not yet available, the premium package, which contains additional 1,500 euros: in addition to the additional elements, the Learnable Bixenon scanners and the audio system BOSE with CD-loader.
Error
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact vehicles in his class.
He is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, because of his driving behaviour and the diversity of equipment.
Moreover, those who do not return many kilometers per year can also buy the i-stop version that is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
The only negative of this model, however, is its slightly higher price, which is between €21.770 for the model Luxury and €23.270 for the tested model sportive.
As a contrast to this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us every day on the new highest train pass.
A premium with a lot of glamour
L. A. rotates the red carpet of sensitivity for Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the "Nine" premiums, the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, were more so. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as always, decided for a dark "Lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your e-mails, without having an opportunity to see certain attachments or surf the Internet.
It has enjoyed its five-minute break when it chose Time magazine to one of the products of the year.
It is more unlikely to see the tragedy, but the idea of itself is especially for young people of interest.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs only very little and has a very expensive flatrate, for example only half the price of an iPhone flatrate.
After seeing the success of the company, there have been two new devices on the market: one which is only meant for Twitter, the other with a live free data service, in contrast to Peek, where you have to pay a six-fold higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this discovery and therefore its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, however, has prepared a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming for Europe as a whole.
Those who travel with a smartphone around the world already know what it means to hide all the data in order to be able to read its email once you have crossed the country border or if you have doubts about looking for a Café with WIFI (or a connection opportunity with background).
The idea of rooming with flatrate is incredible and should actually be possible for a long time.
It has already been agreed that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign maintenance, but after my experience you need a doctoral title in physics and a good glasses to read all the prints.
The repeated criticisms by the European Commission regarding the difficult roaming tariffs for Europe as a whole are almost always ignored.
Throughout your own country, you have always been afraid to read his e-mails and to do so with the right.
That a small device such as FonPeek (but it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have Wifi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariffs means that the telephone providers need to think slowly, but safely and start taking different options into account how they can use their data network.
Childle is another good example of this, in its prices the download of books and other online requests is included.
No veins and no hooks.
This is an online device and you pay for it only once, i.e. when buying, not a month for a month.
And that's exactly what I'm expecting one day from FonPeek, a shopping opportunity with long-term Internet access as the Peek already offers in the United States.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my e-mails with the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for consumers.
It would be interesting, however, to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish colour of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already at Barack Obama's office as president of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this colour and has chosen the same color again to accompany him at his second most important moment in his life: the award of the peace Nobel Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama had very similar models on both occasions: although it was almost the same color - a bright green -, the clothing was made from three parts - clothing, jacket and coat from the same substance, and she wore something gravely attached or a necklace.
It is even so far that at first sight it seemed that the first Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress at more than one occasion.
However, the two garments differ very much in the fabric from which they are made.
At the administration, she wore a dress from top and in Oslo a set from sample.
The accessories were also different: for the first time, green shoes with semi-trailers and for the second time, they were an unusual model, but gold colors.
The hair was also different every time: the hair was raised up as hair cranial at this occasion, when the previous one opened the hair.
75% of working mothers have problems at work due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially in younger women who want children.
This results in cooperation with CSIC in the study "Fruitability and career of women in Spain" carried out by the Institute for Women.
The question of women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of women employed see their career opportunities in the labour market as a result of their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are serious differences between the decision to establish a family and the number of children, whether or not women are working or not and whether or not they are employed.
Those who do not do any other work outside the house, work only half a day or have no fixed employment contracts will be more mothers and more children.
On the contrary, women with a firm attitude, especially in the public area, are divided into families and mothers and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age with a fixed employment receive their first child on average only 3.7 years after combining, an increase of 4.1 years for women with stable employment, which they have used longer to achieve and which they have combined and the first child have achieved very much later.
Furthermore, the nature of work also has a profound impact on motherhood, although less than the calendar on reception preparation," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account at the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the age is so high at the time of marriage and the first child, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be established in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, after having only the primary education or higher education, were on average with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time mother.
In addition, there is another difference between women, according to their level of education.
While women with primary marriage are already married before their first marriage and have their first child, it makes women with a middle or high school degree quite different here and only seek a marriage and then get their first child, Delgado says.
Diane Kruger is worth it too
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name: Diane Kruger.
The next year, the German actor will be the image of various products of the brand and also the popular talk "Why you are worth it."
The main producer of "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant players at international level, will become another famous figure such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before you were the last to join this exclusive club, the players were supposed to be Evangeline Lilly ("lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millionaire").
In the case of men, the cosmetic company also has only exceptional messengers: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy's") and Matthew Fox (schools of Evangeline in "Lost").
The price allocation of the British fashion industry
The British have an important role to play in the model world.
Your top representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
At this point they all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, which was selected as the best model of this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, photos of Fernando Vicente) to the three series of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and in some cases also in real life).
He does not use predictable and frightening genes (curricular biography, life and work), but seeks to find a match for the moving heart of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent spart neither on cracks nor lighting.
While this book is a delicious reading experience, it is also a moving challenge to read and read again and again.
Here are some cuts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost conscious drive, just as I have always felt, without words to find: the joy in contrast with the inevitable fate, the moral and the innocence of God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nhilist, allegorical Christ, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, had, between power and ignorance, with a surrounding poetic humor, without any sense like the bullets that had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was accompanied by this woman with a suffering that lasted for thirty years by being thrown into her bed, in whose flesh the emotions were united by the joys of grapes, a spiritual privilege, which meant to come into heaven on the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris by Sylvia Beach in 1922. It is one of the 8,000 peaks in the world literature, and one has to climb up to the north, on the wall, where the best mountain climbers try again."
About William Faulkner: "There was a comedian cause.
Sometimes he said about himself that he would be the heir of a good owner of the tomb and again he said that he would be the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were inspired by a certain large bee."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took on the bold step that was taken from a bridge from that personality from Munich so that his echo to the night of the 20th century would go deep into his literary form and manner. This he did on a journey where he himself fled and with a speech full of violence before the Würmers.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she fell down and prayed: my God, my God, I beg you to do everything in your power so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are these verses from Spencer: 'the sleep after the effort,/the wind of the port,/the peace after the war,/after a satirical life is found to fall to death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her pack she had always had her depression.
The husband took it very seriously when she told him that Edward VII was spying on them between the Azaleen or singing the birds in Greek.
It is not known any other case where the man was so patient and loved in a neurotic, whose literary talent was still much bigger than his foolishness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to blow Joyce up in Baroja?
What did Benet mean when he didn't bring Baroja into the arms of Faulkner?
What did Cela do to destroy the soul of this man so that he could rely on this potest?'
Severe Aggression
My 70-year-old mother went through our town area of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age survived you and our dog, our dog is a mixture that we have taken out of the animal home and weighs just six kilos, and then from here on they lost two feet and hurt him hard.
Our equipment cannot even be understood in words, as it is incomprehensible to us, since the spaspas should be against a small and helpless animal, which of course was executed on the line.
This is what happens when a woman who went through a pleasant space arrives when she wants to justify these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a driver attacks a dog, he may also do the same with a woman, a child, an older lord or perhaps even anyone who is weaker than he is himself.
The event took place in a normal quiet urban district about five hours after noon on a very ordinary day of service.
The dog's been there all day.
Of course, we have replaced advertising in a nearby police station, but we have serious doubts whether this is going to bring about something at all and to prevent any advantages from beginning, we just want to make it clear that the good criminals were Spain.
Our equipment on the story has moved us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what these young people have to do in order to find a fair attack on an helpless animal, an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good training and respect have remained with animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvil together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially in younger motor vehicles, as both companies have today known.
This initiative will therefore focus on the importance of helm use, as it is ultimately about the only element of protection that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motor accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to transport safety, which "is much more than just the design and manufacture of products that are always safer" and further confirmed that it also contributes to the achievement of a step closer each day with other actions of educational and informational nature.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on the bike run under Slogan 'To be be or not to be' will be distributed in a first phase poster to over 500 bike workshops to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that transport safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and that is why it is always committed as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles to see that one of its main objectives must be the development of safer products.
The sale of small trucks continues to increase
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally begins to see something light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles allowed in Spain in November mean an increase of 12.6% in relation to 2008 and, more importantly, they are therefore the first increase after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, resulting in the figures submitted by the Afac manufacturer and the Ganvam car dealer.
However, these good figures are to be enjoyed with great caution at the time, since the reference data cited for comparison from November 2008 were a particularly bad year with a decline of 60 % over the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total authorisations for this 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous business year.
Since January, 95.853 vehicles have been sold in total, but all vehicles from which the small transporter market consists include: trailers of passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small vehicles and light trucks/cars.
Furthermore, there are still the same weather clouds in the sky, which most of the demand for co-financing, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private persons, the bulk of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises that operate in almost 100 % of all cases with a third-financing.
This must include other factors such as the rise in unemployment rates or the growth of the poor economy.
With this panorama and in contrast to passenger cars, financial support has helped to buy a vehicle from the plan 2000E.
However, this plan is not only for private individuals, but also for self-employed and small enterprises, if they are a small carrier up to 3.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions which cannot exceed 160 grams per kilometre of dangerous goods, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam had recalled that it is absolutely necessary from the state to adjust a special focus on these small loads as well as, of course, on industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The Autohandlers' Association for 2010 is a similar year as it was just last year for which it accounts for 19 % of sales losses (in the case of passenger cars and land vehicles).
Support for brake handles in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case in the ABS anti-block brake system and as it is now taking place with the stability control of ESP, aid systems for brakes must be provided in European cars if necessary.
In fact, they are already obliged to carry out all new authorised passenger cars and light passenger cars for the remaining vehicles, a driving deadline was set for the remaining vehicles until the end of February 2011.
The adoption by the European Union is aimed at improving the protection of feeders, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many accidents due to their working methods.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exercise more pressure on brakes in the case of a critical brake manoeuvre, which is recognised by the system under the brake strength of the driver.
However, this system does not exercise this pressure until the end.
According to a survey commissioned by the component manufacturer for forest vehicles, a third of the drivers developed in an accident in front of the assembly were no longer able to board the brake pedal and half of them had not been completely exhausted.
Up to 1.100 accidents
On the other hand, the brake aid takes maximum force into the brake system and thus reduces brake time and therefore the brake distance that a car returns when braking.
According to a study by the EU, up to 1,100 fatal accidents caused by pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars with this type of emergency assistance were equipped.
There would be even fewer accidents - it is estimated that every four accidents with personal injuries could be prevented - as soon as the so-called smart emergency systems are popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (over radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time carrying on an easy pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts to this, the system will help him to increase pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the combination is inevitable, the brake assistant shall exercise the maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors moves the plan for Opel until January
While the presence of the Opel work in Figueruelela (Zaragoza) has already been announced by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will be started in the first week of April, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the side concerned is already in line with each point of the plan.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which is first submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there is work, will be transmitted by the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM will ensure that a decision on the sale of Saab will be taken in the next days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American car manufacturer so that this is as soon as possible a decision.
GM has to contact some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also wanted to buy Volvo, but won the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports car, which has been recognizable by the Russian Converg group.
If none of these buyers were to enter into an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to leave Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, shall also be maintained.
At the tax of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewellery, the engineers used the S box as the basis and really made it easier for him to make it about 80 kilos, which now brings only 1.275 kilos.
In order to create something like this, they refused for the first time to automatically fold the roof replaced by a cell switch with manual motion so that it was only 21 kilo; thanks to the aluminium pipes used in this model, such as the GT3 "loss" 15 more; by removing the air conditioning again; and by reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos were reduced; by building sports backquet seats again 12 times and five times with the light 19-inch flights.
Then, too, six kilos of less than six kilos of the CDR-30 audio system were added to the missing kilo through the exchange of noise from the substance.
Although it is also available with the double-coupling operation PDK, the test was performed with a vehicle with 6-normal hand movements, mainly on the smaller country routes of California, on mountain slopes that were actually very curved.
In his driving behaviour, he can only be given the notes without a tadder.
However, the decrease in his weight has not led him to do so unless he would now be so sure of the punishment.
It is the opposite of the case: for a long time we have no longer tried such a small and light model, but at the same time there is also a sense of serious security in the curves, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low pace in the time required, until we give him the orders, to melt, to recover and then to get everything out of his engine again ...
He's doing everything he's told. The car's doing everything we're doing to him with our hands on the chain, thanks to his link, which's just as communicative as well.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxers with 320 PS (10 more than the box S) has been released and you can still raise it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise which has already been used for the first time in Panama.
The acceleration capacity is disproportionately brutal, whether it comes out of the stage or when it comes back.
The federations are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the landtacks on which we were working with the boxer Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car was well mastered by the fighters.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole street; and this, although we found some of these curves ice in the morning and roll across the morning.
In short, you can say that it's an ultralight car, a car with which you have an uncharted ride pass, how it might otherwise be more rare and it fits much more than just a small improvement of the boxer Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost EUR 70.831.

The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Cocoon Cosmetic Line and an opportunity starlet at the fashion scenes of 'maison', presenting her evil face with the same intensity as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
The Baskonia itself gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many prominent players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electrica and thus comes to the first place within his group after the brutal performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was eight times the best of his team (29 at the evaluation).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant cases of Herrmann, Olison, Huertas or Micov by a severe dose of use and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end of their victory.
The great encounters out of the perimeter with 16 rated triangles contribute to their final victory.
The game started with the lead of the blues that originally sat on the top of the display table.
Since the first four men from Vitoria had already come out of the perimeter, it could already be noted that they had come to the game field with well-heated gloves.
It was English and Teletovic, who were primarily responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was almost different, only that the men from Álva decided for an inner game of Barac and for the game of Eliahu, who was received on his return to the men with pfifen and applaus, which is his home to build up their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to make the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minimum six" evaluation of splitter has already been received that this would not be the best night of the Brazilians.
Nevertheless, the game was not yet decided, despite the great advantage of the break, and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians once again that they did not win everyone in their field, and thanks to the ever-increasing "hand of Elijah" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pinini strongly contribute to turning the "Gelben" around the grid (50-49).

The team of Ivanovic, injured but everything other than death, had to prepare a couple of matches with security to get back to air and suddenly came to one of them the guns of Mirza Teletovic, which, with the support of English and Ribas, made it possible for the visitors to look beautiful again at the showboard (54-67) at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
In the last quarter the Alaveans were bloated and English and San Emerio (60-75) had already announced that they would not allow anyone to take back the victory they had earned in the first three minutes.
However, Pinini and Eidson, who did not do their best and tried to give their team back three points from the line (70-77).
Despite this, and although splitter was set up because of fouls from the place, the team of Ivanovic did not wake up, and while the Israelites were still up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered the stars
Unicaja lost his voice in Greece against Olympics and had to appear in Eurolagic Group B, which was marked by the events of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), particularly in the domestic game, which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Málaga team had neither fear nor fear of the vote in the Hall of Peace nor of friendship nor of the opposition men who may be one of Europe's strongest and possess a lot of money.
Thanks to their offered game in the first quarter, the Andalusians had to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive trifles, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, mixed the guests with 12-18 in 9 minutes.
Olympias was surprised by the intensity of especially unicaja, even if the local team with an interplay between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schordsanitis created that the display table at 13 minutes 22-20 showed its best interests, the minute in which it would come almost to strike between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and were both disqualified for reasons.
The Greek team finally started to become hot and its over-heated on two players, while the departure of the English Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three major errors caused by Carlos Jiménez at Unicaja.
Among her players in the inner field and the Lithuanian player Linas Kleizas, with his three-phase, she increased her advantage in the 19th minute at 44-32.
A Job could not be created
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks on the crew of Olympias, who, despite his 19 losses, showed up and even made it possible to compare the difference between the game released in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27 minutes, which once again led within the group to weaken.
Unicaja tried to get rid of the many losses and the separation of Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many consequences for the Unicaja in the 31st minute, thanks to the federation and the three times of Cook and the use of Lewis, there was hope again at 66-57.
However, it was really impossible because the Olympics, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimetres within the corrugated area, was not to be brake.
Croatian Captain Nikola Vujcic created it at 37 minutes to increase corb difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to fight and the leadership had to be performed by Olympias.
How much should you earn on account of your Facebook profile?
The users of Facebook can now learn what they should earn because of their profile, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most of its real estate ads, job offers and cars in Spain.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the user's holders with more than 150,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. The users have a form on Facebook available in which they can enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city where they work.
Already one week after the application was first available, the search engine found out that the Spanish worker "felt badly paid" in the average explained in a press release for the product Trovit Responsible Albert Ribera.
The Spaniards are the most paid according to the data available by their search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross amount of Euro 45.226 and a French 31.059, in contrast to the EUR 24,000 worth a Spanish.
As a result, Lkw has an annual net amount of EUR 34,247 in England, EUR 25,751 in France and EUR 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is the net of a customer with 11,592 euros per year; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most wanted places on the Internet in the last three months are a driver, half-days and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in her message in Tegucigalpa.
The President appointed by the Bureau shall leave the diplomatic representative no later than 27 January 2010 when his mandate is officially issued.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian message in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV broadcaster Globo that "Mel" claimed that before that date he had to leave the message he had found since 21 September Asyl.
"He is convinced that he must go on 27 January, because his mission is going on this day and he must look for a new accommodation."
The sender also quoted the ex-Presidents who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the deadline: "It is my position to go as soon as possible with the return of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the election on 29 November (where Porfirio Lobo was awarded as a winner), Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Brazilian message until January.
However, he tried to get a flight to Brazil this week.
This, however, led to the refusal of Zelayas to recognize the status of an asylum seeker who wanted to force the "de facto" government under the chairmanship of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the most exciting days since last spring, when the inflation of the assets was the leading vote on the markets, the market has again returned to uncertainty, which is no wonder, since this is its natural state, in an environment where the maker makes decisions about a future of nature.
The argument used for the stabilization of the markets was to accompany the debt with the direct purchase of assets and to allow the liquidity indirectly free hand to interest that moves around the zero to buy assets in this way.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are as well finished and, without putting into question their heterodox liquidity policy, start to throw some sand into circulation as the ECB has not already done with its annual increase next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox assumptions and we will be witness to a change in risk premiums.
The flows of crops and the differences between the companies increase again, even if they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to understand the private risks and the debt again increased.
Once again, quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferred destination of investors, which will lead to an increase in the differences between the eurozone countries in Germany.
Spain has so far been nearly affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new review following the review of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not cause the defenders of the moral risk to weaken who have once again tried to raise awareness of what they had caused, as they had undermined the devastating effects of limiting credit to the loss of jobs if they had actually claimed a new day of gratitude.
However, what is happening in Dubai indicates a ethnic war between the Emirians in order to restore power in the Emirites and development in Greece has already been predicted.
A government that avoids public debt, elections and a new government that draws the same strain.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It does not make any sense that Ecofin Hungary will save the beginning of the year from non-compliance with its foreign payments and will therefore no longer fulfil its obligations to a euro Member State.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into account the need for extraordinary measures in order to maintain the stability of public funds.
Yes, we are looking forward to an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some overdrafts, which would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt are increased at the same rate as the European corporate bonds.
However, if the European differences were to be reduced and the Spanish would continue to increase, it would be a special Spanish risk.
The standard & Poor's is a farce. While the abovementioned indicators force a large part of the market research institutions to anticipate their scenarios for recovery and to adjust their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, which again comes with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all these warnings do not promise long life.
Renewed it all seemed to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "precautionary" has been said.

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, will take the initiative yesterday before the Sub-Committee of Parliament, where the Spanish energy supply strategy will be discussed in the next two decades.
After his event, on which the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, followed, Galán of the press gave some points about what he had circulated to the Sub-Committee behind closed doors.
According to the president of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest EUR 50 billion by 2020 further from this date to 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the necessary investments would run not to 60 billion but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that it should no longer invest in an increase in energy production capacity but in distribution networks and international connections.
Since 2020, the question will change and the performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to start carbon dioxide and, of course, renewable energy.
In this case, it appears that more 18,000 MWs are needed, under the condition of course by other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft legislation for a sustainable economy which has just been adopted by the government, on a line with what his company has demanded, did not mean, in any case, to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
His opinion was that "it has been a long time since one has made this point, despite a few "ones" opinions, as the President of Iberdrola called it.
As it is, Galán believes that decisions on investments should now be taken, even if they are long-term, because it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework will need to be created to take them into account.
Ferrovial gets the "Handling" from Aer Lingus on ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, Swiss Swiss sport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for the package service at ten European airports to which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The Agreement, to which no numbers have been notified so far, shall be concluded for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castilien-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for smart infrastructures.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million to 2012, 50 % of which are derived from railways.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to examine the energy efficiency on roads and airports.
Akiona competes with Huchtif and Bouygues about its first car construction in Australia
Actiona is fighting for the approval of its first road in Australia, a market on which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction for which it is being done is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about EUR 1,047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German Supreme are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for actiona to establish itself as a construction company and car operators in the country.
The city administration wants to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration of public-private cooperation (PPP) had decided to move the project under a business plan set up by Ernst & Young, the management is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and construction management.
Expected in May, the estimated investments amounted to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), including in the last phase three consortiums, mainly from European farmers.
The group named Transcity is introduced by Akiona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second one is located in Italy, one of the best specialists for deep construction.
The Consortium Northern Direct, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructures and the French construction team Bouygues.
The third and last Consortium, which is in the single election, is called LBRJV, composed of the capital of the Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Huchtif, which belongs to ACS), also owned by the local Baulderstone (in the possession of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in the public building.
The Australian infrastructure market promises strong construction and privatizations, however, to overcome a debt that is valid, since it is only through the purchase of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by the so-called high-tech or billing companies in addition to Asian references and which has to be followed by Spanish builders.
Even ACS has obtained access to this market only by its participation of 30% at high level, owner of the said Leighton.
Millions of Active
Actiona attaches great importance to this geographical area for the industry in which it is already well known for its activity as energy supplier and in the shipping industry.
Among other assets, it already has its large windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies to build and manage Adelaide's disposal facility with a budget of 700 million.
It is now intended to consolidate itself in these two areas and to use these synergies in order to gain access to the dual construction and infrastructure.
The underground bridge, supported by the city's infrastructure office in Brisbane and maintained by Northern Link (Northern Customs), has the purpose of connecting the West Road in Toowong with the surrounding train in Kelvin Grove (see map) to a length of 5 km through tunnel. This is the major tsunami taking place to reduce traffic on the coast of Brisbane.
The road plan issued by the city administration provides for the delivery for summer 2010 and the start of the construction work in December next year.
Even if these bridges are to be opened for transport in the last few months of 2014, it is clear that construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
He has two track tracks in each direction, an electronic wall system and a complex detonation system.
The government of Queensland is involved in funding with 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million).
For high school, Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia owes to the High Commissioner, who signed a contract with the Government last night of 154 million contracts.
The ACS partner will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with glass fiber cable through its domestic subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create fast Internet access for 400,000 people and will work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the building project of King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction has not yet begun and has received 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke about building and managing two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment is EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has bought over its subsidiary Alpine, which has built a tunnel over 2.1 km long for a bus in Slovenia over the sum of EUR 64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after it received the aid for the construction of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take place over 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore gets advertising from Renfe
Renfe has written the advertising and marketing services for the next two years by Sra. Rushmore Agency on a sum of about three million euros per year, shared with the railway company.
This contract also provides for two extensions of each 12 months. Ms. Rushmore was elected from among 16 agencies who presented himself to this race-based competition, from which 4 came to the round, among them TBWA, which was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be commissioned with the design and production of the campaigns.
More than 63 million for France Télécom because of the lack of competition.
France Télécom, the regulatory authority for competition in France, has imposed over EUR 63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions in the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in the case of fixed networks and telephones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and trust programmes for consumers at the regulatory level.
Together with this penalty, the former French monopol and state companies have collected more than EUR 560 million for the purposes of their competition since 1994.
The punishment imposed yesterday was even increased because the authorities waiting for the competition are of the opinion that France Télécom has committed similar damage in the past and therefore has become rescinded again.
Application trade
On the other hand, the French company’s subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application website for increased revenue from businesses that do not benefit from telephone connections.
In principle, this website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 for this site to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the League Championships has been introduced by Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476.4 million.
Since its birth in 1992, the Champions League has developed a source of income for the football club.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million since, bringing them the third and fifth places of the football clubs that have earned most of the money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The UEFA's League to win does not only bring peace with itself. It is also one of the main sources of engagement of the major associations.
According to the UEFA, up to EUR 5,362.5 million has been allocated to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) participating in this event since its establishment in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The Women's Club is in third place in Europe, which has earned most of the money by its participation and the only one who has won the trophie three times alongside the AC Mailland.
The famous Catalan master and last winner of the previous European Cup in 1992 is the fifth place.
The lists include Manchester United and Bayern München, two men who also took part in most of the money by participating in the last Champoins League.
And that's even though they've lost them against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that were able to earn money through the Championships, although it has more titles than all others (five, in contrast to four both Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure used by UEFA.
In this business year, the organization, whose president Michel Platini has entered, accounts for 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA represents 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualification round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who fought for a participation obtained 3.8 million by their blob presence, plus the 550,000 euros for each game they fight.
There is also another bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for one undistributed (400,000 per mansion). The clubs that have come to the end receive three million each; the four that have come to the quarter finals are 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, in contrast to the second, 5.2 million.
So a football club will reach at least 7.1 million and no more than 31.2 million on fixed revenue.
Barça once again earned his victory at the European Supercup in August 2.5 million.
However, the variable payments for the 337.8 million are still available.
This money shall be paid in proportion to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is the first and has 4 assigned places.
Over the last year, the master receives 40% of the assigned money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% of the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed according to the number of games they play during this year's release.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group has provided details yesterday on the purchase of shares with which it wants to acquire an upper limit between 25 and 29.9 % of Sos's capital.
A percentage which does not force them to make a public statement (opa) due to the number of shares.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share paid for 10 years and with a interest rate of 1 % per year due to this change.
Yesterday the Sos shares of EUR 1,85 were closed, so Nueva Rumasa assessed the company 18 % below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of EUR 1,50 reflects the real rating of Sos again.
The offer is related to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group from Jeréz gives the shareholders a 15-day period to share their interest in the sale of their shares.
CMMV ensured that it was not informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateas confirmed that it had been contacted by the Authority.
At a conclusion, the payment would run to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos further structured his business management.
In an attempt to stay on the edge of possible purchases and the legal frameworks of his former manager, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar have announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit.
A decision to make for the first woman who has a high position in the food business.
It is a new position which directly supports the chairperson of the group.
This is all other than freedom from Polishism because the company has been developed into a legal war because of the suspicion of re-integration of more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
In view of Salazar's credit yesterday, former consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) attended the national meeting and confirmed that they had approved the distribution of 212 million without their destination.
CNMV approves the public exclusion of Paterina submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Coalition Commission (CNMV) approved the public exemption for Federico Paterina submitted by the investment company Mer on 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it had accepted this statement after it had been shown that the conditions under the law are respected and therefore the content of the declaration submitted, following the amendments made on 2 December, can be considered as "inadequate".
CMMV also announced that this offer aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares by Federico Paterina at the price of 7,65 euros per share, which is again 8,95 % of the company's capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 euros in the shares admitted to Madrid and Bilbao.
It was also reported that 5,592.778 million shares have been fixed which cannot be transferred until the end of the term and their price has been fixed by Federico Paterina in accordance with the laws.
New vehicle monitoring programmes
In these days of aliens and accidents, the KFZ workshops are not only worthy.
Every day thousands of vehicles developed into an accident will be admitted to the workshops where a customer must assess the damages and costs of repair.
No single accident is the same and the calculation of costs for parts and hours of work can be a long-term and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and hours of work, may take up to two or three hours.
On the contrary, with the support of the latest information tools, it is a question of minutes
That is why almost 100 % of the customers use these types of systems.
The service and application providers shall collect the information they receive from manufacturers to process them and provide them to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American Solera Group, is the market leader; 80% of all views are created with their products.
The two other companies competing with the tool market for monitoring and drafting a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturer is everything other than simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, director of sales of Audadex, 63 manufacturers and importers are co-operated, each of which provides information in a different format.
Furthermore, the amount of data to be processed will continue to be greater until the point is that in the last five years, more versions, variants and motorizations have come into the market than in the entire fifteen years.
As soon as a new car arrives on the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is an important task because each of the thousands of vehicles must be catalogued and given its price.
In addition, each model creates an "intellectual" graphics image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If there is a lot of sold model, the work can be completed within a week if the procedure is slow.
If it is a less expensive car it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audadex has 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain with full information.
Among the exclusive models, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In view of the vehicle park on the road, it is over 99 %.
For the purposes of carrying out documentation and the production of databases, Audadex has eight (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) distributed centres and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than a hundred technicians working there at the same time with three screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Each month they collect 2.5 million data and their customers get updates every second day.
The development of this huge flow of information allows companies to use them in different ways and to offer different products.
The most common use is the use of repair and maintenance facilities, but there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the error or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of the vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audadex offers this offer not in Spain, but in the United States.
The review of the products offered by the auditax can easily provide an overview of the type of support they provide to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, where the star of AudaPlus products is a standard solution to detect accidents for the viewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the costs for the parts, it includes the repair times or the loading prices estimated by the manufacturer.
This tool will be paid for every use, i.e. for every consideration.
The most expensive is for customers who rarely use it up to 10 times a month, i.e. 5,75 euros per month.
On the contrary, each insurance company, which manufactures thousands of items, negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products like AudaVIN, you can identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it was operated by the assembly band only on the basis of the vehicle number.
AudaGlass works with the vehicle ships, and AudaSubasta is a service for the service market on the Internet with which you can offer for vehicles that have been declared a total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or for the purpose of obtaining information about the differences by brand and model.
For example, you can examine how many models of a certain car brand were needed in the workplace due to panic or how many of them were developed in a certain period of time in a severe accident.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computertools.
It is distributed among other Gt estimates, which is also intended for viewers and provides the same type of digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Ensa Group, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions to monitor damages, panic or vehicle expectations.
The GT guide for opinions is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 customers and 53 insurance companies.
In the last three years, its business volume has increased by 20% per year and sales of EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of the last year, they began to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.

Enlargement of accidents on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline Group bought a platform on the Internet for the sale of motor vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85 % of the company's capital, which could increase to the rest of the next year by 15 %.
The purpose of this purchase was to provide its customers with more services and promotion, with the possibility of accessing a vast international market.
This care and shopping service is exclusively used by industry professionals such as insurance companies, buyers, car rental companies, workshops, parking spaces and car dealers who must be registered before their activities.
This platform was established in Germany in 1996 and managed over 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of which alone in Germany.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 buyers.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and every day 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose vehicle number has been registered may no longer be on the track, but it may be used as spare parts.
Cars with historical value may be allowed again, even if they have been registered after difficult authorities.
Cost of the proposed workplace in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company ensures that the user receives a cost proposal in only four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, creation and creation of a cost proposal.
The smooth handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, in particular to convince older professionals who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computers.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 land vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 small carriers and 44 trucks.
Of course you need a computer with Internet connection for use.
After the repair model has been identified using the vehicle number, a graph of the model will appear and then the required replacement part will be selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for hours of work, prices or discounts and can then express the cost proposal and forward it to his customers.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool for observing AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that there are no estimated working hours on the workshop.
The cost of use for this tool shall be EUR 350 per year, an amount which the customer can pay without further payment.
In time, the company works to provide these images in three-dimensional format.
It's an innovation that waits for the auto mechanics for a long time, since you can choose a door with her, for example, and then turn the image completely to look at the inside.
