Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will take part in Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and to be the fourth American President of the history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The diploma, medal and check of $1.4 million will be awarded to it among others for its exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife, Michelle, will be landing in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and will have a program to take care of.
He will first attend the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who elected him in October among 172 persons and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple's planning then plans an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will find its sum in the afternoon at a solar ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
He will be the fourth President of the United States to receive it, but only the third will be awarded the price at the Committee's own initiative.
The White House reported on Obama's speech about the war in Afghanistan at the time of the award.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he is aware that he is receiving this prize as a president who is leading a war in two countries at present.
It reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of its critics will forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check of ten million Swedish crowns (about EUR 1.1 million).
He is concerned about giving to charity works, but he has not yet made concrete decisions.
His program then took him and his wife to a bank including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the Head of Government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather rescinded at this price at the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, that he felt that he did not deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for him alone, but for all who defend the same values as him.
From the announcement, he stated that it would be a "invitation to act" for him.
A defender of the accused nature of singing
The Litomérice Police accused the president of the Litomérice Nature Association of the Association.
Several times in the last year he called for several construction canteen procedures and demanded the money of the investors for his personal benefit in exchange for his call's retirement, Alena Romová, a spokesman for the police in Lithuania.
The president of the Litomerica Nature Protection Society is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and is at risk of imprisonment for up to three years.
The three sides of waste are not in perfume in Brno
In Prague the whole world can pick up its packs of drinks, while in the villages of Moravia in the South you fall on triangular branches on every street corner.
What about Brno?
There, you should take a few minutes before you find the proper legs.
I don't mean we wouldn't pick up all the waste in Brno.
But I have the impression that the municipal councillors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is at the age of three of the wastes not only because citizens can only pick paper, wine and PVC, but especially in view of the number of bees devoted to these wastes.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle into the city center?
It's all science, which requires more time and energy than steel nerves.
The only place I found for the moment is the place of Moravia in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't want me, but I don't think so.
Without talking about the fact that in other districts of the city this is no more synecure.
So to finish, many of my friends don't get their losses.
By the way.
That makes them a little bit more likely to get to the bottom.
I don't care about them.
After a party, I proposed to throw out some glass bottles and PVC.
Unless I've seen any color street Kounicova.
Fortunately I found the right place by going to take the tram.
That's what I said. The wastes were going on.
It's after all the center of Brno, who's supposed to represent the best city, right?!
It is likely that the environment and a supposed aesthetics are not too interested in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy in the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city all over the country, instead of buying some additional bars and offering three more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am happy to have been able to comfort my impression with official statistics after I have spent some time on the Internet.
According to ECO-KOM company data, Brno is really the worst in all the South Moravia region.
Paroubek's budget has resulted from pensions and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or officials may lack the money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for the interests of the State or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of the next year, says finance minister Edward Janato.
When social-democrats and communists imposed an increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will make loans for sensitive expenses, retirements or sick leave. "It is only to solve the problems later, landmine," Janato said.
It is necessary to know that the interest paid on money is much higher and that it will have to be repaid sooner or later.
The state really doesn't have the choice to know where to get the money.
If he does not reduce his social or expenditure, he will have to increase his taxes.
To all those on the left has now increased: the pumps, the institutes, the farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and have no fear for their retirement or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a larger state settlement - next year it will therefore not be missing 163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janato, debt will thus increase faster and with it, the cost of interest.
The State will need money to pay for it and it will no longer be sufficient to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficiency package.
It will also lack five billion to complete the construction of roads and roads because of the transfer of money to several electoral groups.
This is mainly due to already decided and planned cuts which are not possible to change projects to possibly reduce costs.
As long as you keep them, that's not free and no more.
This means delay or stop 30 large songs, and the removal of European funds is also dangerous, according to the maintenance of Karel Hanselka, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD proposed a solution to the very appropriate financial deficit - it will be able in the ČEZ dividends (electric energy supplier and distributor), which the State has most and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the number of dividends is never certain and that it is no case of an unfunded pot.
In the last year, it is 18 billion that have been navigated from the ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of environmental damage, to supplement pension accounts or to reserve for the reform of the pensions to be prepared.
In addition, this assumption increases the actual budget deficit of 5.7 per cent of GDP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer caravan.
The budget for various damages to the victims of communism and crime, including the housing of the Spanish people, has reduced to nearly three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, says Janato.
The Minister will then have to save from the department or, at the worst, touch the government's budget reserve.
There is also a lack of hundreds of millions in the State cache project of a value of two billion, which must be able to monitor online what each administration's expenditure is.
The first stage will start in January.
If the Minister of Finance had no money, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would have taken place, warned Janato.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans will consider a mobile phone that will allow the user to pass from one operating system to another by pressing one button.
The projects that were revealed seemed promising.
It's just a button and you're going from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely what the U.S. company VMware aims to do, which focuses primarily on the development of computer virtualization software.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can change between them, you can distinguish them in personnel and professional
Both will work at the same time, according to Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware company in an interview for computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of the last year and was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones does not depend on fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, from a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a Nokia N800 modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, which was simultaneously running the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is on a large scale.
The VMware company is currently working with European and US operators to test virtualisation on smartphones, and customers should have access to current devices in 2012.
The mountain snowfall tracks the hotels
The desert trails don't have any problem with the remounters.
The lack of snow removes people to book their stay on ski in hotels and pensions.
Thus, it is always possible to rent free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our website.
Internet offers are available, asking for prices but are not obliged to book for the moment.
And if they call us, they'll ask for everything immediately if there's snow or mud in Noël," Martin Jandura said, exploiting the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, it is better not to hesitate to book.
If it is given priority to the economies and the quality of the accommodation is only followed, then we can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler's hotels offer only one week's stay for the New Year.
I think they're gonna try to please them for a while, but they'll also retire and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura said.
The Intours du Vrchlabí tourism agency also offers free beds for all winter periods.
Christmas week is the most interesting thing for the moment, it's not completely sold.
It's still free, we say, half the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared a few Christmas days in the last minute less expensive," said Ingtours' director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí Tourism Agency may also propose the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The fourteenth days of February are still going well, the remaining winter stays are averaged.
This year, the interest in winter accommodation was negatively affected by the fact that there is not always snow in Krkonoše.
People expect her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter on the snowless mountain.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete," Schiefert thinks.
On the contrary, the occupation of the Hotel Horizont in Pec po Snězkou is slightly higher than last year.
We've got at least five percent improvement.
There are some last places for the New Year as well as Christmas.
There is a great interest during Janvier's holidays in Poland and February's well-selling also," Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec, reports.
The hotel Omnia near the central parking area of Jánské Lázné is also full of four to twenty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain alive in Noël in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already had six percent of employment at present.
February is a little lower for the moment, but as the snow falls, the interest for the residents in the Krkonoše will certainly be greater, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
However, the hotels in Krkonoše do not have to expect more snow.
Tomorrow it will be more expensive and if there are precipitations, they should be snowy in the mountain.
However, the time should then be short, reports Jirí Jakubský of Hradec station of the Czech hydrometric Institute.
United States: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It also becomes comical, the acidic effort with which Barack Obama, the head of wisdom, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan issue, which he would consider very simple.
When he was about to let his doctrine breathe so warmly, he realized that he had copied it to the carbon paper since the Iraqi Bush scenario three years ago.
Not happy to use in the text even several times the expression "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: "A new path ahead"
At the same time, he personally criticised Bush's idea of sending new strengths into an Iraq consumed by civil war as being "inresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which included the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only possible and possible success in that the newspapers are not currently talking about all of Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, that is, objectively speaking, left his successor a much more favourable final situation than we could expect.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will be played
These are again the campaign commanders who asked him for an increase in the military contingent, including the Afghan operation commander, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the reticences of the White House despite subordination practices.
He asked 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The President has been exhausted for three months, but in the absence of a better option, at least 10 000 soldiers have been shot.
It has succeeded in extracting the promise of 5,000 additional Europeans, even if it was about 10,000 from the beginning.
What solves most of the problems in all Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw Afghanistan's weapons 18 months ago and end all this process three years ago. All Obama's doctrine raises more questions that it does not provide.
Many doubt the fact that an increase in half will bring the same results as progress in Iraq.
Despite recent fratricidal wars, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders respect the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the exact opposite - we cannot rely on anyone and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, which are used to change day-to-day leadership according to their schedule.
Political institutions, although officially established, will only be able to spread ethnic patriotism from behind.
It is only complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups, given the lack of clarity about the reports, which are still complex by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "state soon to act", which is the basic objective of the operation, does not seem very real.
The temporary horizon of Obama's strategy makes its volunteerism perplex.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only made it worse and is currently on the side of the chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be persuaded that the little soldiers sent into the bull of the war for their "promptly return home" will bring a real miracle there.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is simply irresponsible because the Taliban will consider it to be the wrong attitude of the American deficit.
The latest NATO summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in the military operations in Afghanistan was negative.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their voters what security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically changing the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no effect on Iranians, Americans will face the very difficult issue of a solution to the problem by resorting to military force.
For example, it will have to be answered at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victory retreat of Afghan troops.
However, each such solution will lead to a dramatic return to the Afghan situation.
The only Russian for Obama is the fact that it remains for three years until the presidential elections and therefore it remains long enough to plan on a new strategy, where it would appear to be a total fisco.
Goldman Sachs bank managers will no longer receive cash premiums
The high-ranking employees of the Goldman Sachs American Bank will no longer receive premiums in species.
The company announced it to respond to strong criticisms about its wage practices.
The group of 30 key leaders will receive actions instead of money, which they will not be able to repay five years ago.
Actions may be withdrawn from the leaders if they take too much risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus puts himself in the head of the effort to reliev the rewards with long-term performances in Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the global sense he has to take, said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The concern is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank has become the target of criticism after nearly $17 billion has been set aside for premiums over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the financial crisis under way, the strong banking sector has become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced Wednesday that it had a single rate of 50 per cent of the bankers' bonus of over 25,000 books.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have received Nobel Prizes in all areas where physics is banned
These are five women, a number of record women who have today received Nobel Prizes in technical and literary disciplines in Stockholm from King Charles XVI Gustave of Sweden.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German novelist Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received with their compatriot Jack Szostak the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemical price was directed to the Israeli Ada Jonathan with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz to clarify the structure and function of the ribisomas
The last laureate received the Nobel Prize for Economics, American Elinor Ostrom and his partner Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have to do this year was physical.
This price has been given today to Charles Kao scientists for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith and Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently based on all digital cameras, fax or astronomical planets.
Each graduate received the diploma, Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the financial reward.
It reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category. (about EUR 1.1 million)
If one of them has several laureates, they will share the reward with each other.
The very expected Nobel Peace Prize has already been delivered this afternoon to US President Barack Obama in Oslo in Norway.
In his speech, he recognized the nature of his reward because it was only at the beginning of his course and that he was also the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In the discharge of his policy, he added that in some cases war is essential to achieve peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janato intends to disband. Klaus invited him to Château
President Václav Klaus will be received by Minister of Finance Edward Janato on Friday morning, who will give his seat to the government of the fact that he disagrees with the budget of the State for the next year as he was voted by the House of Representatives
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps Janato's position at the office will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticises the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which increases the crisis in public finances.
This is the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat who reported on the meeting.
Janato then wants to discuss his work with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion korons that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the House of Deputies approved the left-wing proposals on cash transfers and increased staff salaries, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government rejected the proposals made by democratic social groups because they were going to increase budget deficits indirectly.
For this reason, a violent disagreement was born between the left, the Government, Klaus and the right of the other party, which raised the future of the Fischer office which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Greens Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by the MEPs, removes the package of economic measures taken by the Government of Fischer and which, according to it, must end the state's membership.
Klaus, who can ratify the State budget law but who has nothing to do with it, said today in a small lunch of discussions with entrepreneurs, that politicians have long ignored the "serious problem" of "unreprehensible deficit" of public finances.
Now there is no favourable solution, he says.
Only a strong government could bring about an improvement if it could rely on a wider political party consensus, according to the President.
The President of ODS Mirek Topolánek indicated that the budget was in progress and that the Government should return to its future existence.
The vice-president of ODS Petr Nečas told the ČTK that the idea of an administrative office supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Verts does not function explicitly anymore.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer qualified for such words of "dramatic verdits".
The head of the ČSSD Jirí Paroubek responded to Topolánek, saying that the deficit of the budget prepared for this year by the former Government of Topolánek is disappearing and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Already Wednesday, the ČSSD has successfully approved the ratification of the state budget for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood movie
Despite criticism of the fact that major roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that Hollywood Invictus - Invaincu’s new film will present many things to the world about the country, its battles and its winners.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an American actor awarded to Oscars, drew the film on Nelson Mandela's life, infactable against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it's a Mandela of forty-one years old who asked him to take her to the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to take you in, I should be able to see you personally..
The aged actor of sixty-two years who was rewarded with a prize for his role in the Million Dollar Baby of Clint Eastwood drama in the middle of the box, for example, incarnate the leader of a movement against slavery became himself a slave, a powerful president of the United States, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never anyone alive and as important as Mandela is.
The former South African State man has been imprisoned for 27 years for his work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invasive and is the title of an English author's poem William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of Nelson Mandela's joint efforts and of the captain of the South African Rugby team François to unify the country. The president of Mandela has recently chosen to know that his country remains and is still divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He is forced to be able to unite his people by sport and decides to join the rugby players who are among the outsiders at the world level.
The South African team will complete its progress in Cape d'Ivoire in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela's story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose than to play this role so as to bring it closer to reality," Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was to talk like him.
The actor stated that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to dinner with him, to be in college before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to close his hand.
I realized that when I close your hand, I recover from your energy, she passed out and I had the impression of knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the François Pienaar film, the captain of a national team of rugby in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the middle of the rugby.
To him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I sounded at the door of the house, he opened up to me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, "I've got a lot bigger air in the film."
Despite the differences between actors and real models, Invictus, under the direction of Eastwood, received positive opinions and even ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety newspaper summarized his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very good film."
In film evaluations on the Rottentotoes.com site, Invictus received 76 percent of positive ratings.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is resolved: the Russians were testing a fuse
We have been able to observe a strange phenomenon of foreign origin unknown above Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence recognized that it had tested an intercontinental intercontinental ballistic fuse not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a mistake and the "Bulava" kind of mission, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually became the cover of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence in the fusada tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the pilot flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't get involved, or she fell into total flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "missile that doesn't fly"
A Missile who doesn't want to but who shines
This 13th test was normally conducted at the beginning.
It's only at the end of the flight that there's been any damage to the device again.
It's obviously the engine of the third floor of the vehicle that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" was involved in the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij that sailed on the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be just fuelled by a ship in motion and amplified
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by a flying object that was not clearly identified was probably by a defective "Bulava".
The rest of the time, the Norwegians have no doubt that it is a Russian fuse.
The generals argue that this time, we can't say absolutely wrong.
The first two floors of the fortress were resistant and the avalanche hit only the third.
In the previous cases, motorists were aware of first-stage failures.
Although none of the test launchs have been carried out without delay, the Department of Defence's management considers that only six out of thirty errors have been made.
This success rate of almost 50 per cent therefore completes the generals of optimism and they maintain that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and will carry even ten hypersonic nuclear knots of a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetissov signed a contract of one year with the CSKA Moscow for 51 years.
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again appear in a professional match at 51 years of age.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will give his team of the Moscow CSKA in need and will probably have his entry in the game of Friday against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who completed his career in 1998 at the age of forty, is the president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trained regularly and agreed to help the team.
We still have to fix some details on the form, say the coach of the Sergey Nyemtchinov club, quoted by the AP agency.
It was not specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will concern only one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the event of his return to the ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and received 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The oldest of the famous band of Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union, he won twice the gold at the Olympics, seven World Championships, he won Canada Cup as well as the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected the tributes in NHL where he twice held Stanley Cup.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the so-called hockey Temple.
Hyundai has heard the unions and cancels all additional hours
The management of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional hours.
This is just because of the frequent additional hours that trade unions have declared a state of emergency Monday.
Peter Vaník of Hyundai has confirmed it.
However, the management wants to continue to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday that is still working this year.
We cannot give up on our production plan, it is essential that additional additional hours were proposed on Saturday, 19 December, knowing that there were two teams, Vaněk said.
The Sedmićka.cz site indicated that the company has offered 400 Czech royalties to employees who would be part of the Saudi team.
It will also be assigned after the day worked on November 28.
The company, according to Vaník, decided to change how to motivate its employees in exchange for additional hours.
Whether they receive the supplement for more hours, or they can leave the replacement on 28 December and thus extend their final annual holidays indicated by Vanék.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for the costs of transport and breakfast.
In view of the fact that the additional hours were the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and claims of trade unions as employees who had suddenly ceased production last week, the management decided immediately to cancel all additional hours for December, Vaník said.
Up to the last week, the car industry's employees were forced to work almost every day for two additional hours in addition to their eight hours.
The unions shall cancel the strike status after signature of the agreement.
The next negotiations between driving the car industry and trade unions must take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader Petr Kucharí stated Wednesday that they were ready to terminate the strike status if they agreed on their claims and signature of a common document.
The situation in the factory ended on Wednesday, when nearly 400 employees were unexpectedly arrested because of an increasing number of hours.
They also protested against the bad conditions of pay and alleged fraud.
The management defended the fact that employees had to work additionally to meet the requirements for car production.
In the announcement of Monday's strike, trade unions also requested that employees who ceased production should not be subjected to any sanctions.
The unions ask the company to reduce the time spent in additional hours at least.
In addition, they want a payment of 5 000 korons this year (209 € about) for them.
The car plant Hyundai de Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started production in series last year in November.
It has produced around 80,000 vehicles up to September of this year, having a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on the HIV virus "sustainable" as well
A team of Czech and German scientists tested new combinations that could slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main benefit of the improved substance is that it also applies to viruses that have already developed immunity to medicines.
This reality, in some cases, takes the above view of the fact that the combination does not affect the current variants of the virus as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the present time.
Nevertheless, it is possible to radically extend the life of patients through a combination of medicines that prevent the HIV virus from multiplying in the body.
However, their consumption leads to a number of side effects.
In addition, the repression of this multiplication has resulted in the development of what is called resistant viruses where medicines no longer have any effect.
The work of the experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the virus resistance.
They have shown that substances called metallocarbons act on the protein responsible for multiplying the HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are a collection of butter, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all medicines used so far and is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
Researchers are trying to find new "improved" substances on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their links to the proteins of the virus.
The metallocarbons have a unique tridimensional structure: two layers of multiple pairs are formed by bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and bound by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A treatable and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of HIV that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus division caused by HIV protease, there would be no birth of infected particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is arrested, the virus spreads in the patient's body, explaining to researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the Scientific Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cassettes (cf. table) are related by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of HIV proteases has been tested in trials as well as in its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metallocarbons is not as strong as on clinical drugs, but does not weaken on resistant versions against which current medicines are often ineffective.
The metallocarbons, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting combinations to consider more to address the development of effective HIV medications, says Pavlína Rézáčová, director of the structural biology laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemicals and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
This is about the budget. The ODS takes it to Fischer, who defends himself.
The president of the ODS (Democratic Civil Party), Mirek Topolánek, described the budget as "evicting" for the next year and he said that the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should return because of its existence.
The Prime Minister has qualified for the subject of the drastic Vertex ODS.
He said take time to analyze.
The ODS spokesman Petr Nečas stated that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Party of Greens was no longer clearly functioning.
According to Nečas, the Head of Government should decide to join the House of Members in support of the minority who is concerned about combating the growing deficit or whether he is concerned about remaining in office with the help of Parliamentary Left.
Nechas warned that the positions of the ODS and of the democratic society in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Deputies approved the budget for 2010 on Wednesday, however, with proposals for amendments of up to 12 billion korons included on the left.
The House has increased the money allocated to staff salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government's impact on the proposals of democratic social groups was the fact that they indirectly increased budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion korons.
The ODS left the room before the vote, in obedience to the government's wishes as a modified budget is a less bad option than an interim budget.
Deception and inefficiency
Minister of Finance Eduard Janata spoke of disappointment and a feeling of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government would still reflect on the current situation.
It is sometimes believed that if Janato threatened to leave his functions in the event of ratification of the amendments, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech TV, Janato met with the Prime Minister after he passed to the government:
He indicated at the same time that he was asking whether he was going to remain in his duties.
Its disappointment about the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budgetary deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who have imposed budgetary changes, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifys other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to sickness insurance, retirement, or the reform of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not responsible.
It's the case of the chief of the Fisher government and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing harmful, highlighted Topolánek in a text communication since the United States.
He recalled that the Deputy Ministers of certain departments complained about TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to give up his resignation in the face of a fight against the amount of public finances deficit, "it is all logical and correct that it is based on the majority of the left that is currently in the House."
This said that it should not wait for the support and tolerance of democracy.
I have no idea, and once this is done on the agenda, I will dedicate myself to it, stated from the House to the journalists, the defence minister Martin Barták, elected to the government by the Democrats just.
The first Minister Fischer called on the afternoon for a European Council debate in Brussels.
The ODS has made its way back to the Prime Minister's request.
He also stressed at the same time that ODS would probably have voted Wednesday against the modified budget if it did not explicitly ask democratic MPs to allow the vote on the budget.
We do not feel like being an orphan, we are not children, we are not responding to the question of whether ODS has not been sued by the President of the Party in the House or in the country during the budget negotiations.
I didn't notice that my vote would have been wrong.
I knew already when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the coming months would be a confusion of the House and a destruction of everything that was positive, Topolánek would react personally.
According to the new hours of the CDC, there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will be removed or restricted from 13 December by some less-loaded express or regional trains and will strengthen them on the contrary.
Total transport coverage will fall on the date of entry into force of the new two per cent hours compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic tariffs and reduced tariffs.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more connections to the capital, the railway roads will draw up a pendolino branch.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the Prague - Letohrad direct line will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest reduction in transport concerns the region of Hradec Králové of eight per cent in total, unlike Prague and its surroundings, can be seen as an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the movement of some trains expressed on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced by just a few days a week.
Among the major transformations is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esco bathing system, which is possible through the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main train station of Prague (Praha Hlavní nadraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and the train to Šumperk/Jeseník will start at two hours.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
This year's bill for regional rail routes: 200 million additional crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will be paid to the Roads next year in any four billion crowns to settle the visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion in the next year, knowing that the State will participate at least three billion.
This year's regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railway routes have again signed a ten-year contract, so far the duration has always been one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not contribute to a price increase in most transport securities.
The changes will affect only the tickets of a day ČD Net and the internet tickets are reduced by eLiška.
For passengers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 korons.
The price of eLiška will again depend on the road route, while until then it was valid between cities of a region in the selection area and was at a single rate of 160 korons.
The Philippines rebels still hold more than 50 people, children are released
The rebels have now taken 75 people to the south of the Philippines, some of which are students from a primary school and their institutions.
It's the AFP agency that reported it, but who spoke to the original of 65 hostages only.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the institutes.
The takeover took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used hostages as human bugs in an escape from the police.
Local negotiators were currently trying to find an agreement for the release of remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first pursued the rapists following the violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Maginanao in the south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre associated with the government elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the Philippines was arrested following suspicions of mass participation, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential line of the Ampatuans.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they have renewed peace talks with the government of the Philippines on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns the whole world, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood comes into American rooms in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and tells of a part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fighter against world-known apartheid was returned to Morgan Freeman, who was elected years ago by Mandela himself to take care of it.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was assigned to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in rooms, criticism and public feedback will be heard.
Nelson Mandela
From his full name Nelson Rolihlahah Mandela, he was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvesu in South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, then in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize by Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes because it is presented at a time when South Africa is fully prepared for the cutting up of the football world, and on the other hand because the media are driven by new concerns about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination among the people of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, reactions to the new film are more positive for the moment in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations raised to the main roles of Hollywood stars.
However, Morgan Freeman is proud of the film by taking his own terms.
I've dreamed of this role for years and I've been well prepared.
I also met Nelson Mandela personally for power - as it has been said - to recover his energy, he said during the first film official in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember through the film Mandela's personality and message.
It's the history of the Republic of South Africa, but that's what each individual wanted.
Bring the email from the national team of rugby
The film based on the history of the novel of British writer John Carlin is free to translate the title. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the part that gave its creation to the people, the South African human rights defender was appointed to the presidency.
Thus, during the film, Morgan Freeman tries to collect two racial groups of a long-term divided population and as well as Nelson Mandela was among the national mail of the South African team on the world's backbone, which South Africa had then won.
In order to be shown on the mellow pool, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been mostly ovated for 14 years by the white public and was recognized by the white people.
Hopefully the football champion will be able to reunite people in one nation, said the rugby Chester Williams player, who was the only "black" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to see whether the situation in South Africa is going to improve.
However, South African whites are as sceptical as she recently trusted in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a redby fan who went to Britain.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
A transformer is worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region.
A fire included a transformer of the company Čeps from the distribution centre near the municipality of Výškov in Lunsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, port of Ústí pumpers, there are six units operating on fire.
They were trying to let the transformer consume itself, but they looked at their opinion and fired the fire with a mixture of water, muscle and special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal circuit of the transformer.
No one has been hurt, and according to the company's spokesman Pavla Mandátova, the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the whole transmission.
The damages are estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact number can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the transformer will have to be replaced by a nine.
She is pleased that in ten years of activity, the company Čeps has known nothing similar and that the incidents of this type are isolated.
The supply of electricity has not been interrupted, stating the ČEZ spokesman for the North Boheme of Sonā Holingerova Hendrichova, the operation of buildings, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire of the transformation station.
A.s. Cheps is the sole operator on the Czech territory of the 400 kV and 220 kV transmission sets and power lines.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution posts with 67 transformers transfering electricity from transport units to distribution sets and route routes of a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancúra will complain for diffamation against three prefects of the ČSSD
Radim Jancúra, owner of Student Agency, will present today a complaint against three democratic social prejudices.
And specifically against Michal Hashek of the South Moravia region, Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and the chief of the Olomouc region, Martin Tesarík.
Janchura indicated it in Dvacet minute of Radio Journey.
The complaint is linked to the company's attempt to exploit regional rail routes in some regions.
However, all regions have ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of us attacked and claimed that we were doing the ends of the door, while we were only making an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more loving than the ways of making checks which is not true because we know the prices of making checks that have been signed last week.
So there's nothing left to defend us.
It's in exchange for the students' company, Jancúra told Radiojournal.
He also indicated that there was evidence that no region had acted in accordance with European law.
We will therefore prepare a complaint for the European Commission.
Hashek believes that Mr Jancúra's complaint deposit represents the follow-up of his media show that serves him as a free publicity for his company and for his person.
I am very willing to defend my name and the name of my region, and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I believe this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is just Mr Jancúra who manipulates public opinion and resorts to false and false arguments regarding regional rail transport, says Hashek.
Jancúra has already reported last week that it will invest a few million Koreans in a publicity that will mention the disadvantages of the regions.
He told RadioJournal that he had interrupted the campaign after Christmas and that he was counting on it to be resumed after the New Year.
He explained that the campaign would focus on corruption in a broad sense.
Jancúra started its campaign after the regions agreed to trust the rail routes to check out the operation of railway links for an order of about 150 billion korons, without calling for tenders.
According to Jancúra, such an action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to the threat of a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop it, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know what he is talking about, but I won't say his name, Jancúra said to Radiojornal today.
Vaccination against pneumococcals will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcals will reverse the old habits of January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voting is already taking place, saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals appear.
The pharmacovigilance Institute has already defined the maximum prices for vaccines that will pay sickness insurance.
Specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals.
The condition is that they haven't been vaccinated yet.
If vaccination has started in the last year or earlier, the following vaccinations will be paid for themselves.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between 3rd and 5th months of the child.
In the last year, a quarter of families have voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcals.
However, parents paid 1600 crowns more for a dose.
Vaccination of younger people requires four doses.
Experts believe that disease insurance costs 300 to 450 000 Koreans per year at vaccine doses.
However, they are saving on medical care that non-vaccinated children would need.
To date, the State has spent some 500,000 crowns per year for the entire vaccination of children.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janato package".
The pneumococcals are the cause of middle ear inflammation but also serious infections such as meningitis and blood embolism.
According to hospital surveys, up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age have been caused by pneumococcal infections.
In addition to the Czech Republic, some 40 other countries have introduced revaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible obligation to vaccination in the future.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promised vaccination against pneumococcals.
At an international conference at which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we had an optional vaccination.
That's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it's a direction that has to be followed, Kalovský said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to modify the vaccination process against pneumococcals.
We did not think about it at all for the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The optional vaccination has its adverse effects, claims doctors.
Hannah Cabrnochová, president of the Society for Paediatrics, recognizes that a vaccination based on volunteerism is a failure.
If all children were vaccinated, we could consider a reduction in vaccination renewals "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making the vaccination optional" Cabrnochová said.
Experts estimate that in the coming year more than 80 per cent of new parents will be vaccinated.
The vaccination against pneumococcals is also a violation of the fact that it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not by the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should provide funds for prevention, thus saving for future medical care.
Doctors should buy their own products
However, this is related to the concerns of practitioners, who are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to buy vaccines by insurance, doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the State.
However, some Members feared that this would allow insurance to "decrease the amount of sickness insurance".
In this way doctors will have to buy products and expect insurance to pay them.
Pediatrics are estimated to invest approximately 40,000 korons per month in vaccines, which is an important sum.
It'll be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Vol de Musée"
Frank Frazetta's son, a recognized illustrator, was accused of trying to steal tables for a value of $20 million (GBP 12 million) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police said that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been interrupted while carrying 90 tablets in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical leather to force the entrance of the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his personal drawings such as Conan the Barbara and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reporting to the Associated Press (AP).
AP quoted a police officer who said that young Mr Frazetta could have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, 52-year-old Dr. Frazetta Jr. claimed that his father had been authorized to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the tables into a storage facility", reported the agency.
Mr. Frazetta Senior has no such authorization, the agency said.
The Work advocates an increase in the budget tax.
The ministers defended the increase in tax and cuts in expenditure announced in the pre-Budget report, despite the criticisms of opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "was missing" an opportunity to show that he was serious about the reduction of the deficit by reporting his decisions to the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted the holes by attacking the low wages and medium wages.
Among its main proposals are an increase of 0.5 per cent of Social Insurance and a flat rate of 1 per cent on public salaries since 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
The unionists protested that the low wages were penalized by a recession that they were not responsible and warned that "problems" were announced.
The reduction in social security - which will allow for about 3 billion GDP per year - has put the world in the hands of companies in anger because it considers it to be a tax on employment while the objective should be a break-up of the economy.
The increase, reserved for over 20,000 GBP per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
INSTRUCTIONS ON THE BUDGET REPORT
Social security will increase by 0.5% since April 2011
The economy will decrease by 4.75% this year.
New 50% rate on bankers' bonuses
The increase in the tax on company benefits for small companies has been abandoned
Low rates of electric cars and olives
Increase in retirements of 2.5%
According to the Treasury estimates, a person who earns $30,000 will lose $90 per year and a person who earns $40,000 will lose $190, while a person who earns $10,000 per year will earn $110 more.
The ministers stated that their goal of reducing the deficit by half before 2013 was "hard decisions" but stressed that 60 per cent of the additional taxes would be charged on the first 5 per cent of the employees.
Stephen Timms, Secretary of the Treasury, rejected a tax increase and stressed that a reduction in expenditure was a "water shortage in the ocean" in relation to what was needed.
"These figures are important. They will allow us to divide by two deficits, which will be absolutely essential in the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said that he was confident and that the growth of the economy would end by the end of the year.
However, the work projections on economic growth - which will influence the amount it will have to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be met - have been questioned after the Chancellor has been obliged to review its first figures.
In his speech, he stated that the economy would probably fall from 4.75% this year - although the decline of 3.5% was predicted in April - while the loan would be 3 billion GDPs higher than the previous estimate.
" Missing Opportunity"
The Conservatives who will launch a new advertising campaign this day warning against the "debt crisis" of the Work said that the project to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to pay, they have added, "cyclically" difficult choices until after the elections - which must be held in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Secretary-General of the Fantom Cabinet Treasurer. "They had the opportunity to do so and they missed it."
" Important announcements will be made after the elections, whatever the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Work insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from further reductions, in contrast to the proposals made by the Tory which would result in a faster and more important reduction of the deficit.
However, the Lib Dems stated that the money collected through the increase in taxes and the reduction of expenditure would be used to support expenditure in the coming year and not to reduce deficits, claiming that the plans were "air-constructed".
Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, said that the announcements calendar - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave Chancellor face propaganda charges, the money just recovered next year.
However, the Labour Force insists that additional assistance is provided when people are most in need and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Faux budget"
Although ministers have not published the details of expenditure beyond 2011, economists have stated that it was clear that public expenditure restrictions would begin to feel only in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Studys Fiscales) stated that the figures of Chancellor involve, in future, substantial reductions in many areas, including potentially transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually reported," said his Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, whatever the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Adviser to Deloitte's accounts.
"This was a false pre-budget report. Markets are very careful."
The FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest in Pakistan by five US reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid at a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab , the US Ambassador to Pakistan announced to the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether these were the same men who had been declared missing from their home in the United States of Virginia last month.
The United States Department of Foreign Affairs said he was also looking for information on these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egypt's heritage and the other of Yemen's origin.
If these are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are detained," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, the FBI spokesman said that the agency had knowledge of arrests and that she was in contact with families of missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their activities there, and if they are really students who have been lost," she said.
The Pakistan ambassador to Washington said that men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of them.
She said that the house had already been monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
State Secretary Hillary Clinton rejected any comment on the arrests, reported the press agency Reuters, but she said that the United States should "work more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to discourage the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students had been taken away from their homes by their families in northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuse"
Over the past 20 years, human rights have been as degraded as ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
the report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes and another said he had been threatened with violence.
Iran has no previous criticisms about its non-compliance with human rights.
The authorities have stated that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and twelve were killed in Iran after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election led to the largest public demonstrations since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
Twelve were convicted of prison sentences and the prosecutors claimed that at least five persons were sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, from the BBC in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent says.
"Fausse confession"
Amnesty International related the case of 26-year-old IT student Ibrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of dealing with Facebook networks and protesting against the results of the election.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, always in blood and in half consciousness, Amnesty said.
In August, the candidate who lost the election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that after the election protesters were tortured to death and that others were raped.
The Iranian authorities did not have any allegations of violence, but they admitted that abuses were taking place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of an old prisoner who said he had been infected in a container with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election problems and the Government's response, but she said that the mandate and powers of these agencies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested during the last three weeks in order to prevent other demonstrations.
Ski tracks built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to transform Bristol's site into a competition path.
The eventPiste in the Park (A track in the park) attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders in competition for species prices.
On top of the walk of the Brandon Hill Park, a small tremple preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, studying in the fourth year of medicine, said that the view on the top of the track was great but that it was rather frightening.
It's a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city sculpting in opposite directions.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prices have rewarded the best Voltages - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be abandoned to the source.
They and us all the time
Can Islam be French?
pluralism and pragmatism in a lay state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's last book, "Why the French don't like the folklore" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and worried the country for 50 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book presents a much wider and more ambitious frame.
It does not just want to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent several months in museums, schools and institutions that now provide what M. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for 5m-6m Muslims.
He is well aware of hearing and reproducing discussions between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Does a Muslim have to marry in a mosque or in a marriage (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a banking system based on interests to obtain a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern Laic society.
They don't stop the debate until the end.
Conservatives do not believe in a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their lawyers of an Islamic Sunni Purist associated with Saudi Arabia who are today a small part of European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the legitimacy of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved through the efforts of each camp.
It asks what extent French politicians (and the Guardian intellectual elite if they are virulent of laity) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been tortured, in relation to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had historical compromises with Lao republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "key values intensity".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."

The Arctic changes faster and more dramaticly than any other place on the planet.
The ice that makes it is at the bottom of an alarming speed, bringing with it a life that can no longer survive.
Petroleum, gas, expeditions and fishing ships in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their seal.
In "On a small ice layer", Richard Ellis, a writer and an illustrationist, paints a natural story of the symbol of the great North, the polar clock.
A knowledge of the history and complex fisheries policies in the whale, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who demonstrated their success by breaking the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then a 14-year-old brave man who had to fight the point of his musquet, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young eagles, captured while they were swimming beside their mother, just killed, were captured and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show was held 75 hours at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are always a millionth of the surface required for an adult in freedom. The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green because of algae that were growing in its spacious form.

Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians in motorski use powerful rifles to hit their habitat.
Ironically, it is in the water most north of these two species of catfish that the ice will stay for longer.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, an ancient editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and exciting summary of Arctic science and a fascinating perspective of what might be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospherics nor oceanographers can accurately relate to the speed of change.
It's not necessary to try.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th, Fridtjoff Nansen's pioneer trips provided the first information on the source of the glacier.
The underseas of the Cold War then charted the changes of relief there.
Satellite surveillance and sound on icebergs are a great help, but the biggest work is done by tired men, campaigning in the cold.
Mr. Anderson is aware of the extraordinary and minimal world of the Arctic ice tax system, formed by compressed saltwater pellets.
But from the time mentioned above to the microscopic miracles contained in ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, it may be our turn"
From the Marines, among the 6,000 people who have placed crowns on their graves in Arlington
The first class of De'Anngello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to place a simple crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery, this day was devoted to welcoming men and women who once were in their place.
Within a few months, from where we're sent, we're risking being in their place, Robinson said about the soldiers who fell.
If that happened to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, that's why I just try to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers to be gathered on Saturday morning to deposit crowns on the tombs of the veterans, in different sections of Arlington Ceremony's cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the memorial and other people decided to house hundreds of graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue a 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen travel every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize memorials in honor of soldiers and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit partnership, Wreaths Cross America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the tombs of the Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the tombs of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, on the Battery Park in New York City, and on the Memorial site for the victims of the flight 93 from United Airlines to Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation provided more than $150,000 to buy and transport crowns.
Charlene Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had traveled to Arlington in honor of her husband, a retired career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who were sacrificed.
It's a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Emmetroused in several warm clothing beds, volunteers were shopping between the pools and the large hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers chose ancient graves, dating from World War I and World War II, as well as the Vietnam War, because they were not often visited as often as new graves, the organizers declared them.
The moisture was optimum, while the children were playing and the couple were holding their hands, carrying the golden crowns on the gray graves.
Each round crown had a red background color, with a small red cap on the top.
Nearly, he planned the silence on Section 60, where most of the veterans of war in Iraq and Afghanistan are inhumane.
The United Service Organizations provided 1,000 crowns to adorn the section but the shade of the current wars covered the area.
Individuals were crying without hiding, others were praying and families and friends were in cold air.
Some wore high-vote names in the stone while others were trying to see the small black and white information cards, focused on the wet ground for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears on her son's grave.
She was part of Zanesfield in Ohio and had been driving for eight hours to gather on the grave of Sergeant Gunnery David Shane Spicer, dead in July.
No one should ever forget what we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"A long time after I disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban Government has arrested an American resource provider who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, claiming services from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States.
The source, which has not yet been identified, works for Alternative Development Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana tried to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested in advance of being "dangerous".
All revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, are at risk of arrest.
Anti-governmental graffiti and speeches are considered to be serious crimes.
Cuba has a larger blogger community, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are husband and they are followed and hounded by government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but his authorization has always been denied.
The detention of an American citizen may increase the tension between the Government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that continues a "soft" approach to improving relations with the island.
The arrest announcement was first reported by the New York Times, Friday night.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban Government move forward in concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, so that the United States can do the same.
Mobile phones and portable computers are allowed in Cuba, although new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average salary of a staff member is $15 per month.
However, this year, the Cuban Government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or 15 minutes of conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, Internet use is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to join often have to communicate their names to the Government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the American rares imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, quoted in press by the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed to freely distribute mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the American Human Rights Watch Group program, who recently published a serious report on freedom in Cuba called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his elderly brother.
According to Vivanco, a defendant is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban Government often had a negative reaction to the United States when both countries began to start a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities identified an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five North Virginia men to Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying they hoped that this case would be able to demonstrate an important network of terrorists recruiting young radicalized men online.
The investigators claimed that they had cast a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after finding out when one of them made comments approving terrorist waves on the YouTube video site.
When they arrived in Pakistan, these men were led by Saifullah who tried to help them gather together the region of Pakistan's tribal centre, Al-Qaida headquarters and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistani secret services who was informed of the case said Saifullah failed to convince Al-Qaida commanders that these men were not involved in the CIA's involvement in the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargotha, far from the banned mountains of the north-east became a refugee of terrorism.
They were considered infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, a representative of the authorities said that they were unable to keep the anonymity due to the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the necessary authorization to enter Al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI -- insists on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and may be more important, in determining those in whom they trust.
Since the September 11, 2001, U.S. secret services have been given priority in putting men into the al-Qaida network.
The members of the organization play the role of guards, refusing entry to those who do not show serious commitment and who may be spies.
According to analysts, potential American recruits are studied nearly by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American goals and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups should also pay more attention to the recent years in the choice of persons they accept because American secret services have become experts in terms of their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to involve someone in these groups, what better way than to follow his recruitment model than so many other people have already followed? Kohlmann said.
The model is the one that is more and more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protestors in Copenhagen ask for "action" for the climate
Tens of thousands of protesters have gone to the streets, here, on Saturday, asking for more important action on the climate of the negotiators working in the Bella Convention Center of the city.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000 people, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively slowly, although a small number of male activists have exposed some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little had happened during the discussions on the United Nations-sponsored climate, thousands of activists bought from the city, distributing posters in English saying "There is no planet B" and a Spanish, saying "The Earth says it's enough".
Several celebrants joined the protests, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to the country of her mother's birth, Peru, opened her eyes to the problems that have to be faced by the country because of the impact of climate change that has already taken place."
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march -- to pass the word and launch an appeal to the world's leaders so that they can make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be carried out, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented protesters from coming too close to the center of Bella and said that it had arrested 19 people because they were wearing a mask or were holding pockets.
The police prevented protesters from coming too close to the center of Bella and said that it had arrested 19 people because they were wearing a mask or were holding pockets.
According to a passerby who asked for anonymity because of its involvement in climate discussions, activists carrying masks and black clothes exposed several explosives near Copenhagen's main channel, which is surrounded by several departments.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they were all first of the fuses, followed by "some big explosions".
Within the Palais des Congress, people were gathered around television screens to follow the course, all along the afternoon.
But it seems that protesters have failed to reveal the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, representative of China for the climate.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "In fact, it was something I didn't know.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying, "The event is important, I can't understand what's going on outside."
He noted that the course might seem negative or useful according to the perspectives.
It shows the interest of the general public and the various sectors in the area of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or that they interfere with the freedom of others."
Test results reveal differences between races
The last week's federal report on the results in mathematics brought good news to public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the capital facilities, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are making much more progress in the past two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what comes from the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Progress in Education) is the constant difference between the results of Africans and whites, on plans both local and national.
The average results of white children from Grade 4 (cm1) in WashingtonD.C. have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (up to 500), but those of their Afro-American class friends have only increased from three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, ranging from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Afro-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) is generally constant, falling from only one point, from 245 to 244.
The mean white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not important enough.
The overall view of a six-year period is no longer encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between blacks and whites in grade 4 (cm1), when the first NEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by children in the two groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase observed by the Director of the Education Group of Michelle A. Rhee and the Maaire, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrate), were promoted by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by taking into account the high-level elements, which are problematic and generous, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality in the education of the District.
I do not welcome one or two winning points, Kwame R. Brown (democratic appearance), a member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (Elementary School).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said that the test results message was that the city's secondary schools (college) desperately need attention.
Indeed, you always want to see positive signs and I respect them.
But what scares us is that we don't spend enough time and energy in our schools (college).
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to respond to the needs of students in difficulty.
For example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, for students at the end of the elementary and early college cycle who have not integrated the basics of reading into their school courses and who are quite late in relation to their friends.
Every day, the math program for the Kindergarten (mother) classes at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real-life games and experiences, such as they were put in the District by former director Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of NEP reported last week.
I simply think that we need to continue working to offer better interventions to these students at a lower level than that of the class, says Rhee.
Another view is that NEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less good results in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest parts of Washington.
This goal can also have political implications for this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendents of schools, she's trying to use the average class of whites and blacks.
We will focus on the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our district schools so that all families, wherever they are from, can be assured that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark's schools, said in an interview this week that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap of success was the traditional public school, today 180 days in Washington District, to compete with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who agreed with the union of his teachers last year to get 185 days, which he considered to be an "start point" for further increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long symphony.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, comes down and shines a moment of sight in the eyes of white columns, brick façade and greenish hair.
Graciela's parents could only finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never put her feet on a university campus.
Also, while she and other students from grade 8 (4th) of the group explored Gettysburg where school fees are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of a new student than enthusiasmist.
Super This is where I'm going to study! Graciela exclaimed who would like to study medicine, while the guide directed them to the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? she said she was smiling, when she was given the low ratio of law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh to visit children during their three-day discovering trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you are going to university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still widely raised for the large number of American children born to Spanish immigrant parents who have left school where they have become parents at an early age, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a Spanish of the "second generation" of its five-year college studies -- a remarkable success if it is considered that both their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without completing the school.
Their success is important, as researchers say, to the next generations who will play an important role in the country's work.
Researchers who study combatants claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an inherent need for success.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of family contact with American schools.
Menorat programmes also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children of low-income families with parents who have no experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, says Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We have to think about offering a network of support to these children, from mother to school.
The federal program that funded the visit of the universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepared for you), it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to organize the preparatory programmes at the university that begin when low-income families are in high school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the programme has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent attending university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi Petroleum Ministry receives agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has succeeded in attracting major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two events that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the return of the oil industry in Iraq, which is disabled by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are divided into only two of the 10 fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second round which began Friday.
The only one who had put an end to it was lost.
Two American companies received contracts for the fields at the end of June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, they were Asian and European companies that opened the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraqi Oil Forum, an online information site.
It will take a lot of time before another offer is made in Iraq.
The concerns about security, corroded by mass-coordinated bombings, Tuesday and political instability as American military forces retreated from American oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which holds the world's third largest crude oil reserve, say analysts.
In some cases, American companies were disadvantaged because of their rivals, in particular the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and were more likely to take risks because they did not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Ministry.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConcoPhillips, who have enjoyed strong links with the Iraqi Petroleum Department and have provided him with their technical advice, have been repaired.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., held by the State, has more influence on contracts than other companies and is divided with important participations in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is in the process of becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Department of Petroleum.
We are confident that Chinese society will be equal to its competitors and will carry out its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected companies have made tenders which were then compared to the barial tariff that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida would have been killed in Pakistan.
It appears that an American mission, having hit the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, announced Friday by the American anti- spying authorities.
If information is confirmed, this would be the second death attack on one of the terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected of being killed by a couple of missiles launched in their car, Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
The local authorities stated that the missiles had been fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA within Pakistan's anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a member of Pakistani civil secret services, speaking on Miran Shah's phone.
The representatives of the Authority stated that suspected local military officers were precipitated on site and quickly confiscated what remained of "all-delicted bodies".
It was completely impossible for the local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorism representatives provided unspecific evidence that Somalia was part of the dead.
Somalia was described as one of Al Qaida ' s military organizers leading terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize complexes around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to preserve the anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes within the Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic directions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the US authority stated that Somalia had made rapid progress in al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known from the great American public, but this does not reduce the threat he poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second most important person of al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a group of soldiers in the tribal centre, as well as three other operators.
The rate of attacks by the CIA drones has declined since the summer, from around six operations per month to two months, according to the figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a web site moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may have been due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have advanced to reduce their vulnerability while also imputably killing suspect informants, the site says.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul
The United Nations Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he was going to resign from his post in March, at the end of a mortuary mandate with allegations of corruption extended during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
The Eide Department intervenes when Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said he supported this increase but expressed his concern about the U.S. calendar for a withdrawal of troops which would start in 18 months and which would force other NATO Governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send a good signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military authorities to increase the number of international staff to assist political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he was not disappointed but that he would only respect his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it's worth starting to look for my replacement, says Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month void between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives claimed that the name of Staffan di Mistura was quoted; it was an Italian-Swiss citizen who recently presided over a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously conducted United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was tested after his former assistant, Peter W. Galbraith, the defendant, in September, to favour President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and to expose evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide rejected these allegations, but he said that Galbraith's allegations -- which had been thanked -- "have been detrimental to the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism on the international observation of elections".
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the support of the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged United Nations officials to authorize his successor to recruit more personnel from the United States and other Western countries than he had been assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in the way their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration at the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy United Nations embargo regulations had had opportunities for new talent.
The United Nations rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since then, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran has to pay additional sanctions
The Secretary for Defence Robert M. Gates stated on Friday that the great global powers would soon impose "an important additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in nuclear talks.
Gates, speaking in front of a party of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week's visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, derailed the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a defeat.
One of my most pressing concerns is that if I've learned something in Iraq over the past six years, it's the unpredictable side of the war.
The Obama administration considered a set of sanctions that would affect Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians from the street.
He stated that "a set of motivations and punishments" could be necessary to persuade the Iranian Government that it would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "their people would suffer enormously" such sanctions.
On Friday, in a speech statement from the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "problem" consequences if it does not complete its nuclear programme in accordance with the United Nations Security Council and its monitoring agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In his speech in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of his rich uranium storage, in exchange for a desperate fuel needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has promoted such an agreement, which can build confidence on both sides and gain time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has appeared to have been far from agreeing - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
France, I believe, that Iran's regression to some of the international community's proposals for which they had actually agreed at the beginning of October, prompted the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, to agree on what they had not considered, in the light of important additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set 31 December as a limited date for Iran to respond to proposals, before he turned to other options, including the continuation of what State Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions".
In a statement made yesterday in New York, Iran ' s mission to the United Nations stated that it called "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran ' s nuclear activities and said it was agreed to continue talking to the United States and five other major global powers "to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the plane for the rich oil region of Kurdish in order to meet the Chiefs of troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
There are persistent tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income-sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delay in the United States' plans to reduce the number of American troops from 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to ease the concern of Kurdes about retirement. The US authorities quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We won't leave you."
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband were surrounded by propaganda shows saying, "The Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "A more baby, it's a more grave".
They learned so well the lesson that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed at the low birth rate of their city and by the ageing of the population, had radically changed this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their response was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We have no second left, says Wang, 31 years old, Director of Human Resources, who has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the policy of the single child in China, creating two generations of single children known as good games and games, including "small emperors", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple to six when policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 years and older will explode from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the global average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
In the last year, 60-year-olds and more than 22 per cent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission) stated that fertile couples should have babies in order to "help to reduce the proportion of the elderly and prevent a shortage of work in the future".
Shanghai is about becoming "as old - but not as rich - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
Progressive deceleration
Edited in the country's constitution in 1978, the Chinese policy of the single child is now the most controversial obligation imposed by the Communist government.
Couples who go beyond this policy are at risk of paying colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and of being discriminated against at work.
The Chinese authorities have given the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend towards its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some authorities have forced pregnant women of a second child to rape.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to a ratio of boys - girls abnormally high.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually adopted their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they provided more exceptions to the rule -- including for the inhabitants of cities, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they adopted many of their hard-duty slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, stated that the authorities of the central government have recently discussed even more radical changes such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters urging families not to have only one child were replaced by detailed copies of regulations that had the right to have a second child and how to make the request for authorisation.
The city's government has sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their home and to look at them at their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the family planning officer, the response was decades old.
_Other Organiser
Although officials in a rural village of Shanghai Valley say they have seen an increase in requests for couples to marry a second child after the campaign is launched, the most urban district reported no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, has always received only four to five requests per month.
Shanghai officials, who said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010, is still expected to be about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, responsible for family planning in the village of Caolu de Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people no longer want children.
They want to take care of their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said that they would worship two children and that they were legally authorized there.
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners wrongly consider the policy of the single child to be a problem of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with her first child.
It's true, we want the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their frustration.
Wang, who is responsible for human resources, said that she wanted only one child because she was her own. "We were the center of the family and we had the habit of taking care of everyone."
We don't have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, says it most accurately.
For couples working for two, of middle-class couples who lower their birth rate, he says, self-employed must be successful.
People aged 20 or 30 grew up seeing their parents fighting in the first time of capitalist China and they don't want to have this lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even one child demands a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must leave her social life for at least two years.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child doesn't have 9 months, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best motherhood."
Most of her friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too much sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has plans for emission reduction
The conference on climate, sponsored by the United Nations -- which has so far been characterized by disorganized and mutual crimes -- has been under the fires of the Friday bombing, thanks to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations embodying most of the burden in the near future.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gas has highlighted the remaining obstacles as long as it has clarified the way to take.
But it has been seen as an important development in negotiations that are time-consuming, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Written by a United Nations Special Working Group, the text does not state how rich countries would provide poor people with the opportunity to support climate warming, both in the current and in the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
He gave great flexibility to the process, said John Coeqyt, Representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who edited six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General described on UN climate change, Yvo de Boer, as "the full picture".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020 from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions from 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
Together, countries would reduce emissions from 50 to 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to support floods and droughts or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal alterations have occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, a representative of the United States for climate negotiations, rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared with the voluntary efforts made by major emerging economies, if not funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that Obama administration becomes harder on China than Bush administration did, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text was insufficient to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments one hour after the Chinese Foreign Minister, He Yafei, said that the main US negotiator, or "good sense", was "very irresponsible" to say earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to combat climate warming.
With the future economic strategists of the world's major players in the game, there are shortcomings both in the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States, on their respective obligations while the poorest nations insist on the fact that two dozen of the most influential countries ignore scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rica delegate, stated that it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting to know who should rise from the cost of greenhouse gas reduction, even though the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make large emitters responsible for their actions.
It is really a game where a new economic hegemony is developed, Ulate said, which is also the Climate Adviser for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to pressure them to obtain a treaty legally binding in Copenhagen, although most major participants say that negotiations will lead to at least a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which met together with 43 members, drafted a proposal for a 24-page treaty early Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Mitzger, Head of the European Commission's climate unit, said that the action of the small island states "put political pressure on the full political process", in part because they are now unified and demand emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Discussions became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the problems at hand before the heads of government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Minister for the Environment of India, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister of Environment have landed on their plane and have arrived at the Bella Center building to attend eight-hour meetings and information conferences in order to make claims that will be studied during the next week.
The real picture of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the House of Congress every day -- guitar players present night shows that they are moving from their countries and that proposals are prepared and distributed on paper rather than by e-mail -- is a real challenge.
Intensity only increases: almost all major ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We will enter the Court of Great Britain, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the World Conservation Policy International.
The heavy weights are coming.
In Great Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday's syndrome
At 5:13 a.m., Monday morning, a double-six will be spent the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Great Britain.
The country's first high-speed bathing train will reach 225 km/h, while it will run from Ashford, in Kent, to London St. Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, will be joined by Madame Kelly Holmes on the first train of the Javelin out of London.
It is hoped that the new service will enable Britain to integrate a rapid and reliable international network of trains and to re-establish the major meetings of the Middle East, North and Scotland in London.
The small lost trolleys will become thriving bathing towns, the duration of business travel will be much longer and the passage of aircraft and train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties joined the project.
But the ten billion books needed to build a new iron network, the inevitable planning battle and environmental threats are likely to freeze the British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to implement a feasibility report for the government will make its document available to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new London-related line to the West Midlands will be drawn up in the five metres of the urban area and sites where environmental impact can be challenged.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres from the final stage.
It is also provided that HS2 presents three options for a network at a higher speed, heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a configuration in Y for which a high-speed line will reach the West Midlands.
The line will be separated in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west of the Pennines in Manchester and Scotland and another heading north-east, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle up to Tyne.
A single line will cross the Ecosse.
"It seems that this will be the best option of performance," said a railway professional.
When this is over, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour's journey.
The proposals will allow you to travel 400km/h, making the fastest British network in the world.
The initial track is designed to allow 400m long trains and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London line - Birmingham.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the space constraints, it is provided that an existing car will be large to receive the network at high speed.
Railway industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offers this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if the machine starts, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be obliged to run out of high-speed lines on the existing railways in northern Birmingham, maintaining travel times between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure the passage of aircraft to trains, which is a point of reference for the railway revolution.
The taxpayers pay the loan of 75,000 GBP for the Oracle of the Tory
Alan Duncan, a leading member of the Tory Parliament, paid the contribution of thousands of books per year to compensate for the cost of an orange he has built in his home of his circuit.
The party's manager who was recruited by David Cameron to complain that the members of the Parliament were "stained" increased his loan of 75 000 GBP to build an extension on his second house in Rutland.
Additional interest was granted to pay hundreds of books per month to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting control of the expenditure of members. On the last night, Mr. Duncan said that complaints could not be "more clear or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village of Rutland - Melton.
The neighboring houses were sold for nearly a million books.
The cut-off includes a kitchen, salon and a dining room, but the emulsion office says that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent study by the Committee on the Privileges and Standards of the Commons on its pre-emptive loan provisions.
The Committee has indicted him in the last month from any charge of non-compliance with the rules following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the 271,406 GBP of his London property at the house of his circuit in 1991, before he became a member of Parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed some 1,400 GBP per month of loan interest until March of the last year.
In April, its applications increased more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan has not been changed at the time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the loan of $75,000.
The standard interest rate for RBS variable is 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March, this year, without moving since then.
The last publication of the Commons authorities showed that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for US$1.250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his post as head of the ghost office in September, after a cover-up journalist said he was filming it saying that members of Parliament should survive "on budget" after the cost scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on the budget" and you're treated as "from m...e"
He said: "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
And I could have asked more, but I didn't."
The member of Parliament, a millionaire since his former position as a oil dealer, began to have to explain his expenses, in May, after it appeared that he had requested thousands of books for his garden before agreeing with the cost office that this "may be considered excessive".
An activist created a £-like hole in M.D.D.'s pool to protest after it was discovered that he had asked for $4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in the loan last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, approved both by the cost office and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of deliberation or the development or use of rules or whatever.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn't be more clean or simpler."
Faithful, everyone come to see the calendar of the Brighton Avenue.
The Brightton beach cabins have found a new means of promotion for the winter months, an interactive Aven calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to rent their hall for each day of December, using the theme of Christmas songs.
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin from 17:30 to 18:30 a.m. every day with free meals and hot wines.
Noel's songs selected so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is a non-remunerated priest of the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As the Church, why do we expect people to enter into an old foreign real estate? I think the Church should approach people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the Avent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is a place that is creative and living and we try to experiment and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people have shown themselves to plead for an ambitious and binding agreement on combating climate warming, across the world and Copenhagen, where the police have been conducting several hundred interviews.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands of people, according to the organizers, have fallen into the cold in the Danish capital, outside the United Nations Climate Conference, which will be charged on Friday to an agreement that can enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, the growing climate mobilization across the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, has contributed to a "political price" of a very high deficit in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the trial started, when a group of 300 demonstrators, fully dressed in black, broke up wines with strawberries and marts, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-immated police officers were immediately intervened without housekeeping.
In total, the police announced the interference of between 600 and 700 people, mainly from "the Blacks Blocks" members, these ultra-violent groups that were featured in the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, declared the conditions in which hundreds of soldiers were interviewed "without distinction", stressing that one hundred of them "were always held in the street on Saturday night and remained seated despite extreme cold".
Part of Parliament, the court, rather than a good child, has taken the lead in the Bella Center, a negotiating site.
The protesters were arrested some 500 metres from the building, without looking for a place to stay.
A scene was designed to welcome the scheduled speakers, before watching the canals with the participation of the former South African archival of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters were coming in and out of large cities in Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Korean, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, for most of them in impermeable blue sky, had formed a first meeting in the morning in Copenhagen at the Call of Earth's Friends, who intended to form "Blue Seas" for "justice for Climate."
Today, we are going down the streets to ask for repair of the environmental debt for the South, explains Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino soldier from the South Coalition Jubilee in Copenhagen.
We can't keep saying: we've had time, we've loved the Blessed Angelic Kidjo.
There are rivers in Africa, water courses where we can walk as we had never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the internationalist movement has approached environmental organizations.
The French Eurodeputate José Bové, a figure of al-Worldism, explained that he had come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no conflict between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which opens up many particularly vulnerable islands to warming, has been able to stop the sending of demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, were born in the streets of Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for most, fell in red, using bananas with solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, a few hundred meetings of protesters have also been held to claim energy action against climate change.
In France, the "350" network event gathered a few hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Tens of thousands of people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has chosen its president, Georgia declares a "heart"
Abkhazia has chosen her president, a little over a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi claims a "fare".
Some 131,000 persons were invited to participate in this first survey after the Russian-Georgia War of August 2008 for the control of the South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The voting offices closed at 1700 GMT.
The participation rate was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure, according to the Abkhaze Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on Saturday evening.
The five high-level candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the survey.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheïl Saakachvili, "really regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under Russia's total occupation", said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world consider it to be part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After being separated from Georgia in the 1992-1993 conflict, which has caused thousands of deaths, Abkhazia seeks to demonstrate through this election that she is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, declared to AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who said he had voted for Mr Bagapch.
She was among the electors who went to the polling office in a school in Soukhumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with several palm trees before the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidency in this region in subtropical countries, along the Black Sea.
A large panel showing Mr. Bagapch next to the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putine, was installed in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the western part of the country, the district head, Beslan Archba, has reserved a warm welcome for Russian officials who have come to monitor the conduct of the survey.
We, the Abkhaze people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, in spite of Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered with a vodka glass.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the investigation by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two business men, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises agreements with Moscow last year, such as that which has left Russia control over the roads for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims to support neither the current power nor opposition.
A majority of 50% more than one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate does not reach this threshold, a second tour must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: World events, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have bought Saturdays around the world to plead for an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on whom they live, have interviewed nearly 700 people outside a taxable event.
According to the police, one hundred thousand people, according to the organizers, were killed in the cold after noon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries by 18 December, seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Part of Parliament, the Court, a globally good child, has taken the lead in the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The protesters were arrested at about 500 metres from the center, without looking for a penet.
A scene was designed to welcome the scheduled speakers, before watching the canals with the participation of the former South African archival of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the trial, a group of several hundred demonstrators, all dressed in black, bunches of brick and marbles, broke out of wines, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-emergency police arrested them immediately and intervened without housing, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the interference of between 600 and 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of "the Blacks Blocks", these ultra-violent groups that were described in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the car accident by a manhunt and four cars burned near a corner in an accident that led to an interpolation of twenty people, according to the police.
We saw the extremist groups, which had prevented the police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces returned to heaven.
Most of the protesters, who came in and out of large cities in Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Korean, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, for most of them in impermeable blue sky, had formed a first meeting in the morning in Copenhagen at the Call of Earth's Friends, who intended to form "Blue Seas" for "justice for Climate."
Today, we are going down the streets to ask for repair of the environmental debt for the South, explains Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino soldier from the South Coalition Jubilee in Copenhagen.
We can't keep saying: we've had time, we've loved the Blessed Angelic Kidjo.
There are rivers that are in Africa, there are water courses where we can walk when we've never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the internationalist movement has approached environmental organizations.
The French Eurodeputate José Bové, a figure of internationalism, told the AFP to come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no conflict between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, including the Danish mangain Helena Christensen, former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who should address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which opens up many particularly vulnerable islands to warming, has been able to stop the sending of demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, were born in the streets of Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for the majority, displayed red clothes and burning bananas with solar energy in front of the capital of the Philippines.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, a few hundred meetings of protesters have also been held to claim action against climate change.
In France, the "350" network event gathered a few hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Tens of thousands of people gathered in Geneva.
The history of geo has been strengthened by the reform of the general school, according to Chatel
Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to appear in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were "enforced" from the reform of the general school, despite the removal of their compulsory teaching in scientific terminals.
Now, the first students will have every four hours a week and the same program for a shared culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the Minister, "it has to come out of hypocrisy" because, he says, "the S line is no longer a scientific line" but "in large, it focuses on the best students".
The EU and L rows cannot remain sub-files of the S, but it continues: "I have not heard much stories and intellectuals about the absence of the history-geographical in the terminal in technological gaps."
Samedi, an Ifop survey conducted in Humanity revealed that nearly seven French out of ten (69 per cent) failed the government's project to eliminate the mandatory teaching of geography in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this removal, as well as the left and some legal choices.
The Minister added that it was "no question" to delete the philosophy of terminal programme S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (educators and trade unions) called for a Tuesday's mobilisation day to protest against the project, which they claim is the educational training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will have an admission test at the beginning of the year which will be carried out on their discipline, and at the end of the year an admission test which will give them their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also follow courses in situations during the year of M2 and will be the first year in front of students as teachers.
If you add all the stages proposed before the competition, you will already get more presence before the students, or more than 300 hours, it will continue.
Finally, the Minister indicates that he will propose "the individual right to education, something that does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the project to delete the school card "from here to 2012.
A Normal Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince the climate
Five minutes to discuss the issues of Copenhagen Summit: this was the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street Higher Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, opened the first "Ernest" conference on a day consisting of a study of expert interventions, 15 minutes each, filmed and open to the public, found an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that attracted people and made them want to know more, explained at the 22-year-old Edward Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of this day who takes his name from the school basin fish.
Twenty participants are selected from among the experts of their discipline and are selected for their charismatic side, it has been specified.
Regarding climate warming, "we can speak for hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without any notes, but with the help of graphics, in front of 50 people.
This is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will believe that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
The videos taken from these conferences will be posted online on the school site from 15 December.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled in February, followed by others at a bimestrial rhythm.
Payment delays: anger of prison supervisors, planned actions
The prison supervisor unions called on Friday for "general mobilisation" to require payment of the end of the year's premiums and additional hours that the payment was cancelled in January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd watch union) asked staff who would not be in service to show Tuesday morning before the prison facilities and to "block" them to "declare the flight of their dunes".
The CGT-Pententiary (3rd trade union) calls on them to "gather together in general assemblies in the various prisons for strong mobilization" and to consider the non-payment in December of "additional hours, nights' premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of observers, Ufap/Unsa, "calls for general mobilisation (...) to restore discontent and anger".
The Department of Prison Administration and the Department of Justice explain that the additional hours have increased significantly in 2009 and not all have been budgeted, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
The Chancellorie explained at the end of the day that Michele Alliot-Marie had sent a mail to the monitoring union to ensure that this payment would be made next month.
I do not ignore the efforts made by staff to operate and modernise our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this e-mail.
I asked the head of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to prevent this situation from being re-evaluated in the future, said Mrs. Alliot-Marie.
Thus, the December pay will be higher, except for senior management staff who are benefiting from famous functions and objectives, the Ufap/Unsa has deplored, for which "budgetary constraints have good rates".
It's a scandal, the international FO Union of Marseille, announced its decision to boycott up to the new order "all meetings and calls".
Staff will not work on their holidays and holidays if those of October are not regular in December, i.e. for the additional hours, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
When we increase our tasks and missions without increasing our effectiveness, it is more regrettable that we should take care of staff's minors, it is estimated that Bordeaux's CGT-penitentiary.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less poor than others.
However, in all respects the account is not available, the Secretary-General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget, noted.
For Christmas, Obama said to offer "more expensive tricks" than those he receives.
American President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas in the family at the White House, entrusted the "paper" of the little screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple gift rule: "I give more expensive tricks than I get."
In the context of a special issue to be broadcast on the ABC chain tonight, the President and his wife Michelle offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious stay.
Even Bo, the little partner at four steps of the family will be part of the party.
Father Noël also loved Bo, so said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would have "surely" a gift, according to the emissions released in advance.
And Michelle Obama was wrong about her husband's assertions about the quality of gifts she received: "I certainly didn't offer you nice gifts last year," she took the president.
Absolutely, it has been forced to give up before replete with moisture by showing the first lady's pearl necklace: "Who offered you this?".
During this one-hour show, in the detachmented atmosphere, with the famous animation that was a strong support of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a 10-speed bike, but also a basketball ball that his father Kenyan rarely saw offered to him at Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father came to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball ball, the president said.
It's just a long time later in my life that I realized it was him who gave me this balloon.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I tied up all the furniture against the wall instead of setting them up around the road, but I loved this little house of dolls, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reopened, RTL says it's artificial
Johnny Hallyday was reopened in Los Angeles because of important "deactions" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to its surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer has been placed artificially to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was recovered on Wednesday night at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors had noticed "depression resulting from the operation" of the ski lift in Paris on November 26, he indicated to Paris his press service, stating that these injuries had "needed a repair operation".
However, the press service of the singer was pleased to confirm that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be communicated no later than 48 hours later.
According to RTL, a partner of the last tournament of the singer, Johnny Hallyday, however, would have been punctuated in an artificial coma to avoid "pangs and complications".
It is only within 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when it opens an eye, adding RTL.
Asked by the AFP, the press service has neither confirmed nor commented on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drain would have been put after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of Park Monceau for this delicate hernia.
The intervention, programmed for several days by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
This was not available on Thursday evening to comment on RTL information.
Following his operation on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles for a subsequent intervention infection.
The singer Eddie Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, thought on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad step", but he made sure he didn't "no worry" about rocker, which is "a fighter".
He had just called me before leaving for Los Angeles, and I told him it was a conner because it was twelve hours after such an operation, that's not playable, told Eddie Mitchell.
Wednesday night, the producer of the singer Jean-Claude Camus was curious, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "endured".
Mr. Camus also said he was interested in Laeticia, the wife of the singer, and did not notice any particular concern.
But the song's health problems have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his jacket.
Two months later, in general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had discovered that he had been operated with a "small colon cancer", then with a minor infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned as planned for his long "Tour 66", presented as his adhesion tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been quite commented on. Fans and journalists have noted the difficulties of the singer moving on stage.
In mid-November, its surroundings had to even detonate a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/Bassin: Bousquet's first on its fetish distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medald in World 2009 in a large bass, has issued an international title on a distance that he particularly loves, the 50 m free nose at the Euro-2009 small bass in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where the combinations are allowed for the last time has seen only three world record beatus while waiting for a compromise.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 nags and the other two by Russia in measles 4x50 m 4 nags.
One regret for Bousquet, who was responsible for the 50 m world record, holds the mark in large bass (20.94).
On one of the two queens of the birth, 50 m free is the 28-year-old French that was imposed in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten nagers usually started against eight, the first at international level.
Bousquet led the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world brand (20.30) as he had imagined.
We can always dream better and at the same time, I'd say that if the world's record was at my disposal, I'd try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all of the Nagers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be banned from 1 January.
At the beginning of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end up in Istanbul, which had been hosted by the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of combinations has not been used this time at the German Paul Biedermann, a double champion of the world in large bassin this summer in Rome, world record to key.
The young man was unable to lower the mark on 400 m of free nag (3:32.77) but was forced by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I haven't given much thought to this course.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and carry out my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, explained Biedermann.
U.S.: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola adjugated $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophage panel, which belonged in particular to French writer Emile Zola, was awarded Thursday $1.5 million, just above his estimate, announced Sotheby's art market.
This panel was estimated between US$ 150,000 and US$ 250,000 before two feet of 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ.
The marble "representing four dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decoration, surrounded by satiricals and bacons, is a rare part, there is only four or five in the world," explained AFP Mardi Florent Heintz, vice-president of the art of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's.
He was sold among a hundred lotteries.
The sale is still underway, but this lot is certainly the one on which the buyers have most in love so far, indicated to the AFP a Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola goes back to a few days.
The panel remained in Rome for nearly 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared later at the French actress Cecile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bath in his Parisian special hotel, and at Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third Republic in France, and briefly President of the Council prior to the entry into power of the Pétain Navy.
It's been a shadow zone for 50 years.
With the background of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola Succession" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Therèse Raquin" and the freshness of "Rougon-Macquart".
The attempted launch of Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the late president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who refused to act as a safe leader by the Portuguese government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation last night with President Zelaya, it seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
When Wednesday arrived in El Salvador to bring Mr. Zelaya, the Government of Mexico's aircraft was allocated to its original location, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Portuguese government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "demote" and ask the foreign political asylum to give him a safe way of life.
But the dehu president refused, because he wanted to return to Mexico as head of state in the invited exercise.
The Putschist government "was aware of a new mistake in wanting me to give up my job (...), they wanted me to give up," said Mr. Zelaya at Global Radio, which he has often expressed since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted five months in the country of Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added a few agreements by the dead president, who has been fled to Brazil from Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Ambassador of Mexico presented us with a request for safety, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain asylum applications, said Wednesday, Minister of the Interior of the Portuguese Government, Oscar Raul Matute, on HRN Hondurian radio.
I do not ask for asylum in any country. Manuel Zelaya answered in an interview on the Telesur chain, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras was to take place as president of the people of Honduras, he stressed.
Mr. Zelaya's departure Romans had recently mobilized the supporters of the dehu president, who had come to gather around Brazil's embassy, where the military had strengthened their seat.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Portuguese government.
This shows the marginal character of this Government in view of international standards, which it estimated.
Zelaya, who was close to Venezuelan socialist President Hugo Chavez, was interviewed on 28 June, the day he organized a popular consultation to prepare his collection against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he returned with surprise on 21 September and fled to Brazil's embassy.
If he does, he will be arrested for the crime of "high treason" which he accuses of justice, according to the Portuguese government.
Pouchist President Roberto Micheletti succeeded in organizing a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo has been elected during the poll that was challenged by the United States but challenged by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street Mount, U.S. Trade Balance Feeds Optimism
New York's Bourse ended on Thursday, the figures of the U.S. trade balance testify to the resume of both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67 per cent and Nasdaq 0.33 per cent.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has progressed from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and Nasdaq, technologically dominant, 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The standard extension index & Poor's 500 was awarded 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different economic ideas, Judge Lindsey Piegza of the Financial FTN.
But this remained anecdotic, she was upset, thinking that the market would focus on "the glass half full".
For Peter Cardillo, from Avalon Partners, investors are mainly focused on U.S. trade balance figures, "which shows that the activity improves in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6 per cent in October compared to September, at $32.9 billion.
Analysts were waiting for the reverse of an increase in the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big new is the increase in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth of the economies of the main US trading partners, Christopher Cornell, of the Economic.com research firm.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States have increased against any expectations last week, to reach 474,000 applications.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new job applicants "has fallen to the lowest since one year," stressed Scott Marcouller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The compulsory market has fallen.
The performance of the 10-year-old Treasurer's well has increased to 3,482% against 3,423% on Tuesday evening and from 30-to 4,492% against 4,408% on Tuesday evening.
Cuba: hundreds of participants of power consist of "White Women"
Several hundreds of Cuban authorities have made plans to marry political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Day of Human Rights, and to prevent another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents have been interviewed.
A quarter of "white ladies", married or close to political prisoners, were shot in the street by the government's participants in Raul Castro while they were walking to the capital center to complain about the release of political prisoners, a journalist from the AFP noted.
At the bottom of the Yankees!, "mercenaires!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Vive Fidel and Raul!" were scanning, the rising point, the participants of power to the dissidents.
These were escorted by civil servants who came to "insurance their protection".
The guard, a similar demonstration was conducted against the "White ladies" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also willing to manifest themselves on Thursday for the International Day of Human Rights have been interviewed by civil police, a journalist from the AFP.
The police forced the dissidents who were made up of government actors in civil vehicles, according to the journalist.
Dissident interplays in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Receiptors of the Sakharov Prize 2005 of the European Parliament, the "White ladies" had arranged an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners" at the number of 200 according to the decision, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda has been in prison for 20 years.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of which remain under the conditions.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents "mercenaries" or "agents" to be sold by their declared enemy, the United States.
The Cuban television has taken account of the demonstrations of pro-government military judicious anti-revolutionary judicatures.
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of abusing rights and freedoms, including expression.
A force officer kills an octogene in the neck and makes 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
A two-armed army officer killed an octogene and wounded five other people in the center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at an hour of flight, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the aggressive, 28-year-old, would have been attacked by two hostages and for indeterminate reasons, an octogenian, in or before a pharmacies of 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaurez, learned from police sources and with witnesses.
He was seriously injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to a police union officer Alliance, died at the hospital of his injuries.
In or before the same medicine, he then took a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, 30 years old, was confused and injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogene was found.
The days of the other injured are at risk, living organs apparently affected by police sources.
The pregnant woman then did a malaise and would have been hospitalized "in shock status", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then be out in the street, always bulled Jean Jaurez.
He would have hurt two past events, apparently in the Hasards: a thirty-one and a quarter-year-old, the last rape.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two mouthpieces that he wore behind the back of the dope, explained on-the-spot a leader of the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Presse.
Several past, including young people, according to evidence collected by the AFP, have tried to master the force.
I've seen a guy from thirty years old with a green dress.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't arrive because the guy was expensive, reported Alberto, a servant of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell upon him, including a local police officer who broke the poignnet, he added.
Every day, Jean-Jaureès, at the height of No.61, two municipal police officers, including their commander, tried to interfere with the armed man and were wounded by poking, according to police sources.
The facts were produced in one of Clichy-la-Garenne's main artreries, where there are many shops.
I was told that there was someone injured outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very important cry to the Abdominal, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person from thirty years of age was hit with knife wounds.
These are the effects of the national police who arrested the man who had been robbed of identity papers.
The Nanterre Park has been investigated by the Department of Justice of the Hauts-de-Seine Police (SDPJ 92).
The force was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in the context of his watch.
A police source has not excluded him from being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to lead him to the Clichy police station where he was escorted.
It was "in a state of overcrowding" as "all the forces of this species whose forces are performing under the influence of the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again complains about the withdrawal of prosecutions
The French-Polanist film lawyer Roman Polanski once again appealed to Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), the withdrawal of prosecutions against his client, currently assigned to reside in Switzerland for more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the realiser of the "Pianiste", denounced three judges of the second California District Court of Appeal of serious procedural errors at the time of the facts in 1977.
I appeal for the discharge of duties here and now, Mr Hummel said, before adding that the conduct of the judge responsible for the matter at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the shower".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has been dead since -- would have discussed, before he had delivered his judgment, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious error of procedure.
This discussion was revealed in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, researched and desired), by the same prosecutor, David Wells.
However, Mr. Wells finally said in late September that he had "misleaded" the author of the documentary.
In the case where the court refused to leave the proceedings, Mr. Hummel claimed to hold a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The charge was based on the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no discharge of charges could be considered as serious as Roman Polanski would not appear before the court.
The filmist, 76 years old, was expelled from the United States in 1978, before his sentence was pronounced for "unlawful sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He's never taken his feet back to the United States since.
The deputy prosecutor of the Los Angeles county, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "must be there to present himself to the hearing".
In this case, should the message be sent not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, what is possible?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "demonstrates a favor to the court, while ignoring its authority".
One of the three judges -- who now had 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed to him "that there were other alternatives to escape".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for the withdrawal of persecution against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also complained once more about the end of the persecution.
Recalling that her client no longer has to be shaken by any rebuff of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure has been fair.
Thirty-two years, it's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was assigned to live in his chalet of Gstad, waiting for any extradition.
Wall Street is done without direction, frozen by the rise of the dollar
New York's Bourse ended without direction on Friday, in a tirade market between better indicators than planned in the United States and the dollar increase: Dow Jones won 0.63% but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points, while Nasdaq , technologically dominant , has left 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The standard size index & Poor's 500 has increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106,41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, found Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in close borders, the volume of exchange has become very low and I think it will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of economic indicators better than planned, which "has helped to improve market view on economic recovery stability", summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November for the second month and much more than planned.
The U.S. consumer's confidence was further re-adjusted in December, at 73.4 versus 67.4 last month, according to the preliminary estimates of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes were frustrated by a new dollar progress, at the top of two months in front of the euro, which "may lead to low economic-sensitive sectors", explained Owen Fitzpatrick, of the Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost the ground.
The compulsory market has fallen.
The performance of the 10-year-old Treasurer's well has increased to 3,540% against 3,482% Wednesday night and from 30-year-old to 4,497% against 4,492% guard.
Miss World's election once again in South Africa
After a month of periple across South Africa, the 112 candidates under Miss World are on their way to franchise the last line to realize their dream: to be chosen by the world's most beautiful woman in front of a billion viewers.
During this great show of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them already picked up their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta du Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo de Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino de Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were selected Miss sports or still Miss top model during their African stay.
That was a real turbulence.
Visiting such beautiful towns as Port Elizabeth, Durban and the Cap was extraordinary.
I've seen so many things and I've lived so many experiences, Mrs. Sierra Leone exclaimed.
This competition, which took place for the ninth time in South Africa, has been broadcast on Saturday directly since Midrand, in northern Johannesburg, from 1700 (1500 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to return my crown.
This experience has been fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, highlighted Miss Monde Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the Australian summer.
For young Russia, its second residence in South Africa has been marked by many exchanges with candidates and rediscovering "the lands to cut the breath in this country".
After a month of galas, repetitions, meetings with the press and safari, the Missions now focus on competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and presented to this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both became Bollywood's stars.
It's the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful of the world, but it's only about appearance.
We are ambassadors from our country and I want to come home with the crown, launch Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will point to this 59th edition.
The candidates will spread traditionally and certainly in bathroom mail.
The show will be animated by a television presentation, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a member of Miss Monde Steve Douglas Committee.
South Africa has shown that it was able to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to balance, says Julia Morley, President of Miss Monde.
The candidates like last year made a safari, visited Soweto's famous cityship, but this time on bicycle, and enjoyed the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met South African President Jacob Zuma who closed their hand.
Not running for a Head of State, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will undoubtedly remain the trip to Cape Town (South-West) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to promote a little more of the event.
I've had a lot of people I never thought I could approach.
I'm sure I'll be back for the World-2010, excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive," according to his son David.
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive", assured his son David on Friday that he had arrived at Los Angeles airport where he had to return to his hospitalized father's head for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it's going very well, reported to the press David Hallyday on his flight from Paris shortly after 1300 locals (2100 GMT).
The son of the singer, the air stopped, made sure that he was going to "very fast" at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for a consequence of a skirmish operation on November 26.
The singer was "placed in artificial coma this night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and administering his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed as an artificial by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for a subsequent infection during the operation of a skirmish on November 26.
The singer had to be reopened on Wednesday night on Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French school in Los Angeles, where their daughter Jade, to attend a school show, found a photographer from the AFP.
The head of orthopedic and traumatic surgery at the Pitie-Salpètriere Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would return to Los Angeles next Monday.
The producer violently caused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who performed the song on 26 November at the Monceau International Clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were different, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about a possible judicial procedure to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus estimated that Johnny Hallyday was "very fast part for Los Angeles, with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this on-line doctor who made sure that there was no problem with this trip, and that surprised me, since I had myself two minors, he added.
Earlier on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "partless, empty" after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had performed the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a Neuily-sur-Seine clinic where he was exercising at the time.
In 2007, he also worked with the actress Charlotte Gainsburg to absorb a hematom following a brain hemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor with a sulfate reputation, condemned to several cases by justice, in medically responsible cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
My lawyer Olivier Metzner, who was a lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused her of being "a man without screws" who continued "regularly" before the Order Council, and who is "far from being recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself on Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
It stated that the intervention was "perfectly well conducted" and that post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not need a drain," he added.
In any case, the singer's turn, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems to be between parents.
Obviously, a repeat of the tournament on 8 January (at Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
UDF's association increases the tone and sums up the New Centre to no longer use its sail
The UDF, controlled by the MoDem de François Bayrou, responded on Friday to the OPA's attempt by the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the escardian ex-parte seal, while still no longer using it on any support, despite judicial persecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF century, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after holding his left hand.
The Defence Minister, whose partner is the UMP, had also planned to confirm this Saudi strategy before the National Council of the NC.
In support of his work, he received support from Mr Hervé de Charete (ex-UMP transferred to the NC) who claimed the ownership of the UDF brand for the first time in 2004 to be deposited with the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the UDF office, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to leave, came out of his silence to launch a stay with the minister and the MP, summarily not using the stamp and passing it on to them, despite judicial proceedings.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements indicating that you are going to propose your political movement to +retain+ the UDF century, write the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central Alliance.
You are also happy to follow up on your military equipment and on the site's website, the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the current Slogan + UDF+, also see the email signatures.
As you do not ignore it, you do not have any right to use this cycle, explain to the UDF office that continues to withdraw the NC to "represent the name of the UDF immediately of any support as well as (son) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) mark to its legitimate legal ayant right".
If you do not do so, the courts would be taken to comply with the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, preventing signatures.
In their letter they stated that UDF "is a political movement entirely since 1978" and recalled that Mr. Morin and his friends had "the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, like others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and the establishment of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of training based on Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, he went on to the office, "when he put the mark," he was not "more than a member of the UDF for three years," but to the UMP.
It systematically and fraudulently takes advantage of the absence of UDF acronym deposit to do so for its account.
This indelicacy is in the process of becoming a criminal offence, they claim, before they become ironic about the NC's strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more proper to make a name for ourselves than to try to get out of the anonymity by knowingly taking a name that we have no right to."
Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt has been accused of taking advantage of a state of weakness of the Octogenaire for the sponsorship of a part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years imprisonment and EUR 375,000 fines.
This decision means that there will be a good trial in this case of a saga of one of France's richest families, in which the mother and daughter are still resting while holding the roots of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the 15th correctional room also ordered that a medical expert from Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, should be conducted jointly by three doctors.
The main heritage and shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any event, under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Park during the investigation.
Doctors appointed on Friday will have to report before 10 March 2010 including whether Liliane Bettencourt was able to be weak and for what period.
I think she'll submit.
I'm going to talk to him, told Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kijeman.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent new... The expert will show that he (Mr. Banier) maneuvered this old lady to be protected, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has engaged in criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and touch-all artist, who accuses her of having benefited during years of her mother's weakness in order to obtain a billion Euros of gifts, in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or master tables.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by the photographer, which she considers to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to consider the admissibility of the action undertaken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers' posters sometimes turned into a big family debate on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer wrote three letters sent by her client (1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was sorry about Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 email, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "You can explain to my daughter that I wrote once in Banier, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to him since his marriage."
On the other hand, Nanterre's Park once again felt that the complainant was not eligible to act, so much more than a guardian judge refused to do so these last days to make his request to open a judicial protection procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in justice, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said the representative of the public ministry, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that it would take place once the proceedings had been carried out on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for economic intelligence will have been won...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees reminds consumers of their position before the market revolution: it is to attract employees to "values" determined above as they were at other times, to impose on consumers of products intended by industry technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has given rise to market conquest strategies on the ground... although the authoritarian attempt to impose off-products of customer preference factors comes back on a regular basis!
Demobilization of employees can result in fatal demolition.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects particularly the frameworks.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all of the company's intellectual functions, including R&D and economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE "needs all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a prospectus" ; it requires employees to make an undertaking that the authoritarian management revenues are totally contrary to.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution which would be the focus of the company's concerns as well as the customer.
The full usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Internal opinion surveys – how will the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
First of all, because I've been able to see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally happens, after many tragedies, to do priority... what it has always done.
- Then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – has a relatively high impact on the importance of its own mistakes.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simple view of human behavior.
They have a mechanical interpretation of psychology over large engineering schools.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old Behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the U.S. neuroscientists and widely disseminated, among other things, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to conduct the "leviers" (sic) of the commitment of the frameworks, a recent survey of Ipsos appeared in Le Figaro.fr comforts the leaders in a mechanical governance post, which is not adapted to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilisation factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the good functioning of modern businesses is intended to adopt a definitive vision of human behavior.
In any case, it is essential to integrate, in any reason or practice of governance, a basic finding: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of achieving part of their dreams, their ambitions and their projects.
Currently, only studies from Motifunctional Analysis have adopted this concept of employees' motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a default dose that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to assess what they are offering them to carry out their life projects.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, corporate leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and return their human resources "to the place".
They thus create a land conducive to concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo Discourses: The "just War" Values of Loans Right in Obama
The US law welcomed the speech delivered on Friday by Barack Obama's guard in Oslo, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had broken up the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, this time the presidential speech, at the initiative of Sarah Palin, former vice-presidential candidate at the 2008 elections.
I liked what she said, said Ms. Palin, the right-hand wing of the Republican party, in the U.S. Today newspaper, adding that she had addressed the subject of the war "sometimes necessary" in her memories that came to be published.
The war is clearly the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
You have to stop these terrorists all over there, she loved it.
Mr. Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, used yesterday in Oslo to justify the use of force, to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, believed that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I have found that the speech was very good, the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential issue.
On the other hand, I have found this speech all historically, said Mr. Gingrich, questioned at the "The Takeway" radio broadcast.
The former election, considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican investment for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to have seen "a left president" remind the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and would not be able to pay a price for peace if the application for force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush's ex-computer's chronicler in Washington Post, Obama said "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as "the citizens of the world" as "he always does," "he spoke as an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security hole that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," said Gerson.
Among the few right-wing non-confidential ones, a Bush era faucet, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, has qualified the speech on the National Review Online.
On the left hand of the President, Democrat Dennis Kucinich was alarmed at seeing Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When war is involved in the notion of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocents, it has been preserved.
However, the left-hand press remained commendable instead of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while still thinking that Nobel has been awarded earlier to Mr. Obama, has qualified for "superproduction" even for a well-known speaker for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should be used as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression" hit the California daily.
Mr. Obama "promoted the speech he needed", said the New York Times, the judge "both asleep and building".
Drivers: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three Marathon negotiations, the trade unions in the road sector and TLF, the only patronage organization to be stayed until the end, reached an agreement yesterday evening ending with the word of strike and the heavy threat to Christmas supplies.
At the meeting of signatures on Friday evening, the State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" this agreement, after several negotiations on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to sign the text of the agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And the same thing if three parental organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had knocked on the door.
But it took more than six hours for a meeting to be held at 1100 in order for the whole world to agree and the text to be signed at 1800.
The conflict "would have been very detrimental to businesses" and "he was afraid he was going to disturb the last few years," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in wages of 4 per cent for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In time, for low-sales, "we go from €8.72 to €9.06.
It's not a big thing, but part of it is very far away, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
This is where we will be ordered to our soldiers that there are no blocks, no blocks of speed centres.
But we can always have some exciting things that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed "a good deal", even though it was "hard to grant increases on high wages due to international competition".
According to him, the increases will be from EUR 170 per month for low wages and from EUR 100 to EUR 120 for the highest.
This is the agreement on the good sense and respect of employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the reassessment of 3 per cent travel costs and for the general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow the issue to be addressed in the 13th month and the modernization of the collective convention.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in patrol charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft rectification finance law for 2009, voted on Friday night by the National Assembly.
The Government will ask the Senate to vote "in identical terms".
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply in the first place to the companies associated with the organization, and in the second time, to all professions, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
She'll be "in the shortest time," assured Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of parental organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR has declared a "push market" because 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to oppose the food of the next Revelation, Unostra has disappointed us.
On the other hand, the agreement is "to cross the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this week-end, disgruntled unions of RATP proposals
The disturbances on RER A, France's largest common road transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on the 2nd day between trade unions and RATP management left them on their hunger for primary demand.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important week of purchases before Christmas, there will be only between 1000 and 2000 trains due to two trains on the central throne (between the Defence and the Nation) and four trains outside the central throne.
The connection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change train.
The Lafayette Gallery, which awaits 200,000 customers every day, is pleased that "the RATP is making efforts to serve large stores".
The RER A through the west is the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP throne is short from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Leger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about two trains traveled at point hours, and almost no train in cross hours, as planned.
As Thursday, there was no cohesions on which the French were organized.
So early in the morning, Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station was much more frequent than usual, including the absence of colleges and colleges.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old Jack Nkabaina explained that she had been up "30 hours earlier, to be sure to arrive at the hour".
The Saint-Lazare station did not know of saturation, said the SNCF, which had provided a framework for agents and forces.
The RERs operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to meet the metros.
New General Assemblys of Grievites will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will consider the results, "magres" by the trade unions, of a meeting with the Friday afternoon direction.
The Director of ERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for ER A on all aspects, working time, careers etc.
This is not what drivers want, who claim a first two, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even included its parental premium proposals, the CGT was indicted, stressing that the direction "was not intended to solve a problem while in the road and SNCF".
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a broader review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", explained RATP.
What has also been said to trade unionists that the company "was not a week-end user".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had rented an establishment committee in Paris.
It was then that the board, which had so far refused any discussion during the strike, suggested that the meeting should be "in a state of anxiety".
The conflict threatens to expand to RER B on Tuesday, following the deposit of a warning by Unsa and Independents.
The unions apply for a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150 of EUR 30 variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to millions of passengers every day.
RER drivers, both in the second part of the career, are affected by EUR 2,200 to EUR 2,700 gross and EUR 600 to EUR 650 premiums for the scheduled hours, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissipates the pro-curding party, heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court issued on Friday the resolution of the main pro-Kurde party of the country, a decision that was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the southeastern part of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision is likely to seriously complicate the Government's task, which has just been handed over to the Kurdish community to try to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "foster of activities that are detrimental to the independence of the State and its inalienable unit", stated the press President of the Hasim Kilić Court at the end of four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes were required to make the resolution, said Mr. Kilič, adding that 37 members of the party, including his President Ahmet Turk and Mr. Aysel Tugluk, are political life bands for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the rise of the parliamentary immunity which Mr. Turk and Ms. Tugluk were receiving and the confiscation by the Party's Property Treasurer.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (up to 550).
Its leaders had prevented before the summit from leaving Parliament rather than sitting as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya, who accuses the DTP of complying with the "Directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered to be a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political vine of the PKK's rebels.
However, the party ensures that it does not have "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the Government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict is that the Government has just held hands to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, in order to try to withdraw Kurds' support to the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leaders had stated that a resolution could lead to a recluse of tensions in the South-East Anatolian, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of the arrest of PKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan have taken place during the past few weeks with the police.
Since the announcement of justice, a thousand protesters have been gathered in front of DTP sites in Diyarbakir, the large South-East city in most Kurdes.
The order forces pulled larymogene grenades and used water cannons, while protesters launched molotov cocktails or stones, with fronts.
Hundreds of people also showed up in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Turk said that the decision of the Court was going to "increase despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (kurde, ndr) by banning a party, he said to the press.
The Government, formed by a party from the Islamic movement, also disappointed the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
This did not resolve anything, Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a total tolerance of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Island.
We can, of course, expect a response from the PKK, which has been added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly of these months.
The first snow can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very severe winter.
However, the responsibility of the road navigation and sanitation service (FES) is clear that this is not for citizens to be defrauded.
It's just that agents can test vehicle technology and learn to master them well.
And according to meteorologists, this could be good for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to attack snow and snow.
The FES is following a very developed plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explained that since he was snowing on the city of Frankfurt and that temperatures are below zero, 20 main routes (called A routes) from large sandy vehicles were used.
This includes major traffic routes, main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
These include pumping access, common transport routes, pedestrian areas and bridges such as Atselbergstraße.
The FES officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, 1040 kilometres of wind must be paid with a well-adhesive driver in 3 hours of maximum time.
That is why the FES service starts at 3 pm in the morning "so that the roads are broken when the daily migration is started".
There or it becomes more difficult, it's when the snow falls at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, we say to the driver of the road skiing and sanding service "because no car driver is willing to pass the sales vehicles".
Then, if it does not snow any more, we are dealing with access routes and desert routes - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and lateral roads are finally reached.
Mr. Brauburger well knows that this is always a few complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES' teaching team is on its way to prioritize hazardous areas and crossings.
With regard to bicycle tracks, FES services are generally unable to deal with them.
Mr. Braubuer pointed out that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the state of bridges between 22 hours and 430 hours.
As the rim is very rapidly formed on these surfaces, sales vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature falls below 2 degrees.
It also happens that the police are calling for this special service when necessary.
The Denosing of Dynasiums
The Tawa hallae was similar to other carnivorous dinosaurs: this bipede would measure about 2 meters long for 1,50 m high, its rear limbs were powerful, its long skull was covered with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms would end with fluffy flues and it had a long neck.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
However, as the report Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and its colleagues in Thursday Science magazine, Tawa Hallae is one of the first dinosaurs to have these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was part of the country's supercontinent, and was located near the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt said that the discovery of the Tawa clears a new day the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
In fact, it informs us about the parental ties, the distribution and characteristics of the latter.
It is in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt has taken out leaflets with other paleontologists on the Gohst Ranch site in the north of New Mexico
Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History of Utah and a member of the team of follicles tells them that they sometimes came to find twelve ossements a day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists quickly realized that part of these ossetia belonged to a new species.
The follies have updated the remaining five species.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
Researchers have baptized it in the name of Tawa according to the word of the Hopi Indians for the God of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an exceptional discovery: the fossils of dinosaurs from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to some incomplete fragments of os.
All paleontology experts do not share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of Bonn University does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but it does indicate that it can confirm certain theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth some 230 million years ago.
However, most of the oldest fossils are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify all first dinosaurs.
Experts are asking, among other things, when the saurians were divided into three major evolution groups: theoropods (carnivores) which include tyrannous and velociraptor appeared later and which descends birds, sauropodes, long-term quadrupeds, and those that appear to them and Ornithic herbivores that are part of species such as triceratops and stlegosaur.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first therapists.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found indications that Tawa Hallae has small air bags in its ears at the level of the skull, as well as birds that are the descendants of the therapists.
These small air bubbles make it easier for birds to breathe in relation to mammals.
It seems that at the Tawa hall, the vertigo were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, Tawa is one of the oldest therapists presenting small air bags in her ears.
Since the apparent line of the immense sauropodes also had air bags and a slight barrier, it may be thought that their common ancestors already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive wave of migration to North America.
As the most famous dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers concluded that the sauri were there.
As a result, the three great lines of development have been divided and separated from South America to the rest of the world, namely the whole of the emerging lands forming the continent of Pangé.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the paleontologist team has also discovered the remains of two other therapists that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, advance researchers.
Alan Turner of the Natural History Museum of New York and co-author of Science Studies magazine said there would have been at least three wave of migration to North America.
He has heard some contradictions.
Martin Sander, paleontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the silicaur, who lived in the present Poland and belongs to a group belonging to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a mistaken view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while there is virtually no one on other continents.
On the other hand, how did dinosaurs become the dominant cetaceans of the secondary age while they had a relatively rare collateral line from the reptile branch, still remains a mystery today.
In the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of current crocodiles and many other sauriens.
At the end of the Trias, dinosaurs spread across the planet in favor of the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared from the Trias and Jurassique.
Such success, however, is not permanent.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There could have been a massive extinction in which dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or, then, dinosaurs were better suited and could therefore eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not permanent.
150 million years later, the fall of a favorable meteorite has been the result of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias, which has since been growing in the shadow: it was mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in São Paulo
The list is long and there are signatures all over the world.
There are teachers at the University of Toronto, Cambridge University, Vienna or Berkeley University in California.
There are graduates from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, São Paulo, Berlin or Breme.
The evacuation by the police of the University casino J.W. Goethe de Frankfurt makes waves across the planet.
278 professors and teachers at J.W. Goethe University but also other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North America express their solidarity with Protestant students in the Westend Camp.
In a statement written in German and English, the police intervention required by the university's board of directors is inconsistencies.
Last week, the President of the University of Werner Müller-Estler had evacuated buildings occupied by students and teachers after walls and works of art were painted with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories argue that the degradations did not justify "a so violent intervention by the police command against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
The evacuation represents an “inadmissible attack” on freedom of research and education.
Focusing solely on vandalism acts is "delegating and criminalizing protests" and trying to forget the reasons for mobilisation.
The Board of Directors of the University thus withdrew from discussions that would still be necessary.
The trainees require immediate suspension of the criminal proceedings.
Most of the employees did not participate in the degradation.
Legitimation of protests
Young people from the Verdi trade union sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) are strong students.
The protests are only the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional secretary of the young people of the Verdi Syndicate.
As for the Minister of Sciences of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took action by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of places is totally unacceptable, she said to the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday at the current TV show.
We understand the meaning of protests, but we do not accept vandalism, expressed the CDU Member of the Regional Parliament, Peter Booth.
The parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Left (the Linke) did not share this opinion.
The CSU took advantage of some painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the party La Gauche (Linke)
Instead of reflecting on the students' arguments and claims, we evacuate them.
The part La Gauche has put forward a motion which is the Minister of the Interior to report on the conditions of police intervention.
The New Silicon City
For a long time, it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a research site for secret weapons, under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics are installed there.
In September 2008, Zelenograd's representatives established links with Riedberg, instead of French sciences – with the universities and companies of the Frankfurt Centre for Innovation (FIZ).
A "Protocol of Close Cooperation" has been ratified by the representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg.
The signatories were the deputy mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and chief Anatoly Smimov of Zelengrad for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz, head of the project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose main point is scientific research, will go to Zelengrad for a seminar.
Scientific mode
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
In contrast, Russian scientific companies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of well-known Soviet research institutes and research companies.
There is the Institute of Electronics in Moscow, the large Sitronics and Rossijskaja-Electronica companies.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literally translated "Green City") takes its name from the hills planted in the heart of which research centres are built.
Project S21: a shower for Stuttgart
We can't afford enough for the magnitude of the Stuttgart 21 project.
For its participants this is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
If you want to. S21, it is much more than building a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will fill the heart of the capital of Bade-Wurtemberg, in a desperate chaos of songs for a decade.
Stuart 21 was born in the '80s.
The main streets of line, with roads ending in the whole city, had the reputation of being the remnants of the 19th century transport technology that had been affected by modern rail traffic brakes because it took a lot of time to move the rear locomotives forward.
Come, stop short, start – that's what he has to do.
That's why line heads should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
Also in Stuttgart: a train pass station, which is located on the midway around the Trans-European Magistrale of the Railway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The implementation of the S21 project will indeed begin, although the 80's vision is no longer compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost, in order to cover the rent in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, the lineheads no longer really have problems with entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with auto- and car-pilots to the two extremes.
However, the achievement of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched next to the new line of intercity towards Ulm.
Regional and Community policies have brought it.
The railway company is part of the party because it is the contributor who is responsible for the risks of the largest federal infrastructure project and not the public enterprise.
From a urban point of view, this project is allowed to be well justified.
There is a urban space that – if you believe in computer-generated planner graphs – will be very confusing.
For the rail transport system the S21 is bad.
The passage station and the extension of the section are designed for the traffic of persons to whom we were assigned - and it is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time there was no competition for high-market flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on the strengthening of freight traffic because rail transport is much more relevant to the environment than road traffic.
But the new route, with its hints, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21 is much more serious than other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be included in the Souabe project.
It's the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missing for other points of connection and engagement in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport is mentioned in all sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the Rhine Valley of 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 this line has been built slowly.
It would be really urgent to support here on the campus.
But the S21 project has the effect of a freezing Saturday.
The interior of the Rhine Valley is in a position to become the unique gateway to international trade, and this is in the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the judgement reached on the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Government of the Land referred to the possibility of appeal to the Hesse Administrative Tribunal for the Prohibition of Night Flights.
The Minister for Economics Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had been responsible for examining the judgment by the Administrative Court and which is a document comprising more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation on the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction project of the north-west landing track of Frankfurt airport.
The permit to attract 17 planes between 23 and 5 in the morning, as the Government of the Land considers, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against nighttime air raids.
The coalition must have decided for 4 January if it wishes to make an appeal against the judgment rendered.
The opposition is critical this time and attempts to pressure the Government's representative so that it can reach the Federal Administrative Tribunal for Leipzig.
The head of the PSD Torsten Schäfer-Gübel Parliamentary Group invited the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise before the elections and which was to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be awarded as a total failure to a given word.
It is very difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the Chief of the Tarek Al-Wazir Greens, welcoming the FDP's electoral slogan "We have our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch rejects Schäfer-Gümbel's claims that the Government of the Land tries to authorize even night flights using "the lawyer and robbery".
It takes time to carry out a precise legal review.
The coalition does not want to make decisions on the basis of a "first quick impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the statements of his group on the prohibition of night flights is completely wrong.
American banks are paying for the aid granted
The large American banks, which are heavily affected by the crisis, are dissociating from their ties towards the State.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully paid US$45 billion (more than EUR 30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
The U.S. television chain CNBC reported on a report by Citigroup also considering reimbursement of the aid received.
Banking institutions are thus seeking to remove tax restrictions, which would accompany the acceptance of sums, such as the limitation of allowances allocated to managers and the higher cost regulation.
The Bank of America launched an increase in capital by selling securities to investors that reported $19 billion in cash.
The rest of the sum comes from bank cash flows that are well filled through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
On Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the Director-General of the Bank of America, expressed his appreciation to the American contributors: the injection of capital has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capacity by stealing the Merrill Lynch investment bank from the most powerful financial distortion.
The Citigroup also plans to spend money on financial markets in order to free itself from State protection.
The U.S. Bank could thus launch a 20 billion-billion-dollar increase on Thursday, reporting the CNBC chain citing banking environments.
The Citigroup's spokesman did not want to comment on this information.
In June, the Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had reimbursed the public funds they had received.
Acceleration selection
Finally everything happened even faster than planned.
Two weeks after the current editor-in-chief of Nikolaus Brender was released by the German chain Administration Council, the successor has already been appointed.
The Committee wished to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who led the Berlinese edition of ZDF was a great favor.
However, the chain did not want to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also the intention not to feed further to ZDF Markus Schächter if the proposal would not be accepted by the Governing Council.
Frey, who is the candidate for Schächter, needed 9 members of the Commission vote on 14.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known at the end of the edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend the five-year contract to Nikolaus Brender, but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council were declared to be in favour of the recast of Brender and 7 others voted against, and Brender's destruction by vote was a very costly and predictable mistake for Schächter.
In fact, the CDU, which is a majority of the Board of Directors, had already been allowed to hear a few weeks before the vote, did not want to relocate Brender to his post.
This is Roland Koch, the Prime Minister of the Hesse Land who had organized a link against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly estimated editor-in-chief by referring to the fact that ZDF's listening rate had fallen below Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, undermining the growing political influence on the ZDF.
In the end, there were even 35 public law experts who were involved in the debate and who felt that Koch's way of acting was anti-constitutional.
But it won't work.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied science-political, pedagogy and Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked in the Southwestfunk (Radio organ of Rhenanie-Palatinat) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German national port Kuwait).
In 1983 he became the editor of the ZDF at the news magazine "seven-days" (Today's Journal).
Then he continued: from 1988 to 1990, he was the assistant editor-in-chief of the period; then, in Washington in 1991/1992, and until 1998, he was the head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazines" (Bimental information issue presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then the head of the Berlinese edition.
After Brender's resignation, while he was just elected a journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazine, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent to the Governing Council, Minister-President of Rhenanie-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Countries should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the proposals of the intentional staff cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of the political personality of members of the ZDF monitoring committees.
Peter Frey, the likely successor of Brender, had been working closely with the Board of Directors by criticising the Commission with enthusiasm in his decision to leave Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalism, Schächter was able to propose it for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, as well as that the Board of Directors could be elected without the support of a political party.
In the architectural representations of the parties, Frey is ranked liberally on the left.
High netting in university studies
Partly success for students: after a year of educational famine, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Countries decided to show themselves more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Conference of the Rectors, an agreement was made to establish that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to ease the weight of the examinations: a single examination should allow the selected study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload will have to be reviewed to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
The political authorities and higher education institutions want to facilitate recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Landers are also committed to organizing more flexible common structural requirements for the ranks of Bachelor and Master.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulations from one country to another.
Less Reviews
Since the beginning of student protests in last June, the Minister for Land Education and the Universities' Rectors have consistently expressed the term "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a real meaning.
The Accreditation Board decided to significantly reduce the number of examinations: "Every module should normally be concluded by a single examination", can be read in a document of thirty pages on the future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, President of the Accreditation Board, said that by reducing the burden of exams, it should be possible to stop due diligence.
The "study" should be the decisive criterion of the organization of studies in the future.
Modules such as the background must be carefully examined to see if this sense of performance cannot be avoided if it is sometimes felt in the selection of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest RID knowledge on Kunduz, the opposition considers that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate fraud.
Students should "have the possibility and the range of action necessary to enable and promote personal initiative".
The new regulation will concern access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "recredited" every 5 years, however, which means only in 2015 that all cycles will be reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards established by the Countries.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put pressure on the Lands so that they could rely on agencies so that programmes are not too burdened and the review regime is not too strict.
In some countries, specialized universities and higher schools have already been consulted with their regional departments to take appropriate measures.
Rénanie-Palatinate has so far been the only country that has agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organise programmes aimed at strengthening the educational orientation offices as well as the review offices and the service of international relations.
The Landers and universities provide for a budget of EUR 10 million.
In early 2010, the Government wanted Parliament to adopt an amendment to the higher education institutions Act.
After that, there will be no more than one review to cover its studies.
The organization of studies should be more flexible and more effective to ensure the recognition of notes from other higher education institutions and access to the Master should be simplified.
By the end of the next year, the "studyability" of all university cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and opposition again discussed the issue of study conditions in the country.
The decisions were appreciated, but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said he would like that the organization of education policy no longer go through the future "under closed doors" of Ministers and Universities Rectors.
Not later than after the educational strike, students as persons concerned should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education were supported by the President of the Conference of Speakers (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "Our students' experience is very useful" she said yesterday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Countries with which HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the union of education and science (GEW) decisions made in Bonn are not far enough. He claims the right and the possibility for each Bachelor graduate to be enrolled in a Master cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Landers ensure the Bachelor students today, that there will be enough space for studies in Master and as good study conditions as possible.
The countries must therefore have more courses.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education have not mentioned the possibility of facilitating access to the Master.
More than one footnote below on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Arrives in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work of poet Werner Söllner, in which he is thematically thematic intrepid phrase bribs, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who has gained freedom but has lost its linguistic territory at the same time.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and then director of the collection in a youth publishing house before installing himself in Frankfurt on Main.
Söllner received different literary prices; in 1993 he held the very popular poetry class at Goethe de Frankfurt University and since 2002 he has been head of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Moussonturm artist's house in Frankfurt.
He spoke a lot about him in his recent non-literary circles on Tuesday, at a convention in Munich, whose theme was "The German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirroring of your Security files".
Apparently unstable and genetically, Söllner made a statement in which he recognized himself before his German-Roman fellow writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer as an informant for the Security Police.
Söllner received the German-language prize together with some of the participants in 1989.
The rounding tests had begun in 1971.
I am, Söllner concludes, "so someone who doesn't have enough to resist the security threats."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost at the same time with respect to the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its exemplary literature with the powers mechanisms of dictatorship, the literary scene is clear and, in particular, the community of the original German authors of Romania, in a case that clearly demonstrates the ambitions and the decline of a political system based on police surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as far as it can be said from current knowledge, not only touching but also victim.
In his own Security case, IM Walter played a role, ensuring the specialist of the literature Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had intervened in his favour.
"He could have removed it from all the difficult situations at the time," says Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before this audience was unexpected, however, the idea of an old dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for Security spies already wrote Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims will have made speculations and will sometimes have become what real names have been hidden behind the names of Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast to Germany where the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the inheritance of the Security files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been unstoppable and frustrated in recent years.
It is only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler Institute was created to work on the Assimilation of Security Archives (CNSAS), but the return of files has been rather advanced.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by an interview of an old security officer of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize in Herta Müller, expressed himself three times more in terms of the laureate.
She had a psychosis, and finally we asked her only once.
The infamity of power thought it could be expressed here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, while insoluble issues are associated with Søllner's case, they often occur in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been married? The weighted reaction of the audience, in Söllner's view, lets hope that the follow-up of this chapter will be more defined by a desire to know that by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the generation of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Tumultes at the Champions League
The impression was that a representative arrived there, drawn to four epiles coming from the right of a Christmas party, on which the sports producer had set up his goods when the new VFB Christian Gross coach went up to less than a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, a orange plastic bag of the supplier's hand.
The man, whose hot throat attracted attention, is allowed to drive into a city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our fifty-year-old could have taken the flight himself – he had no alcohol and he was no longer happy.
He had been having a nice evening but he had to get back to work tomorrow.
Because it's now that it's gonna start.
The words of Switzerland that came to be committed three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth end," that is to say in the league of champions thanks to our 3:1 against the Urziceni Union of Romania" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. This will be a brutal struggle so that we do not fall back."
The "great work" is waiting for us tomorrow.
There it is to repeat the results of the daily league of champions in Mainz.
And there will be a need to overcome the weaknesses that have created the surface after the three shipping objectives of Marica (5), Trésch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Out of range
The eighth final match of the League Champions (match go 16./17. + 23/24 February/ match return 9./10. + 16/17.) will be held on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the entry into service of the successor of Babel was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not limited only to the one who had had a chance, who had transmitted it to the destabilised Stuttgart professionals, an unfathomable motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I was seeing the players and I told them that they should focus on their boots, I advised them to be more courageous, explaining the "blowing of souls" – Gross – the recipe of success that sounded so well that no longer had any effect on the carer Babel.
He introduced a certain magic, with Jens Lehmann - party from Babel - "in the foot when there's a new impulse he sometimes happens to things that we would never believe."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of rest for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player through his dynamics, tries to describe the "phenome" found by a proverbial "free wind" and the working method of the new boss: "It's someone who goes through the action and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But Babel apparently missed it.
VfB Stuttgart has not passed the head yet, keeping manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs particularly tenacity.
Like Gross, players and managers are careful to assess the victory against a totally excessive and low level of Romanian hospitality.
They had also won in Glasgow before four days later a bad revelation in Leverkusen with the 0:4 object Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reports that they had achieved one of the season's goals but that they had others who were still far away.
We haven't had the hard time yet.
That Heldt's day of his 40th anniversary did not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first home victory for three months, is from the weekend events that a television interview by the goal guard Jens Lehmann just rebuffed before the start of the match.
There are decisions others make and not Jens, against Heldt, in response to Lehmann's acerbe criticism.
He had accused the head of style weakness and said he had decided to change coach under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also thought as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousness that his day of freedom after the matches had been removed.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by a purely egoism" enfonça Heldt and annoncça of the consequences for the target guard.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends with these two quadrennials.
In any case, they agreed for the rest, that is, without the team's prior work by the trainer replaced, strong sports and combatative representation would not have been possible.
Babel and its assistants were “for a large part in success” and returned to the heart of Heldt and Lehmann – and even the man in the plastic bag acquired.
Championshiped world weights debts
Hot fight in Berne: Kevin Johnson the challenger was constantly promoting the Vitali Klitschko World Championship.
But after twelve difficult rounds, Ukraine defends its champion of the world's heavy weight after the WBC federal version.
In the uniformity of the judges, he is subject to points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains its title as champion of the world of heavy weights.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a victory at the points of unanimity against American judges Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has defended his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Ukraine had already won twice the World Championship of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately, KO has failed so much.
Klitschko, 39 times winner in 41 professional battles, has twice suffered his disability due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson has to accept his first defect in the 24th battle.
In the Berne Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, above its 2,02 metres, by its left.
Johnson, less than six inches [11 cm] earlier, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, succeeded in avoiding the fall of the champion, thus putting Klitschko into play against his dangerous right.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has particularly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continues to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his beats only rarely reached the champion.
He's even the second blogger after Timo Hoffman in 2000, has gone beyond the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had done a lot of noise in the capital of Switzerland before the battle.
He insulted Klitschko's "Zombie village" who "is not really capable".
During the summer's weight, the champion couldn't prevent Johnson from causing him to fall down his nose's sunglasses "to see his eyes".
Four wins since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko was reimbursed during his fourth battle since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After almost four years of pause, he had fought by Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "sa" WBC belt he had previously left without fighting.
This year, defending his champion's title, he won the battle against Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September against Chris Areola from the United States.
"I just got a break in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the most important four titles in the family.
His brother Vladimir is a champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it's British David Haye who, having detonated the great Nikolai Walujew - 2,13 meters - in November, carries the WBA's centrifuge.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko which was supposed to take place in September.
It would seem that his promotion company is planning to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
The opposition's front attack: the head of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz case.
The SPD and La Gauche parties (the Linke) request the opportunity to explain.
Hamburg/Berlin - After considering the latest information on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition appealed to the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) for deliberating certain facts.
The Minister deliberately "formed a contradiction" on the death strike of two tankers in September last, said the Chief of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the release of information from the ARD chain "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
Of course, that means he's lying.
The order to kill was given to the total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
In substance, the content of the report contained by NATO and which was read by Mr. Guttenberg said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the purpose of the strike was, not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO survey report, 142 people were killed or injured during the American Air Attack which had been launched at the request of Colonel Goerg Klein, Commander of Kunduz.
The Verts, the SPD and the Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak in the shortest time before the Federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague at the Reds Renate Künast are of the opinion that Ms. Angela Merkel must clearly say whether the target mass strategy is part of the federal government's Afghan policy if Chancellorship, Army and Information Services have approved this new strategy.
The Government's spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancellor had no influence on the military's operations in Afghanistan, he said.
Samedi, voices were increasingly strong to express doubts as to the true reasons why Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert had been sent to the Ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL Journal, the information they had sent to Guttenberg regarding the attack on the tankers was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have distinguished the existence of the NATO report and hid some of the gender details to the Minister.
In the round of the two senior officials, it is understood that they reported several reports to the Department of Defence, including a document of two pages of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
The "Frankfurter General Sontagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have asked for clarification in an e-mail.
He has not received a reply to this request yet
On Saturday, the Ministry did not want to comment on these charges and sent the Federal Parliament's investigation committee to present the following Wednesday in order to shed light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dream
Some see, look, images and hear voices that no one else can see or understand.
There is nothing but mental illness, or under the influence of drugs, but the boundaries between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything's going very well.
When we are extended into our bedrooms, we can give us free access to the worst dreams and fantasies.
However, he who wakes up to experience a state of dream, understands and sees things that others do not understand, has speeded up the reputation in our Western world of being mad or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices appear only in mental illnesses or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is the same neuronal activity that enables us to design houses, paint tables or write novels, but sometimes affects the boundaries between dream, fantasy and reality.
A state of consciousness, taking the form of a dream, can be presented in the most diverse forms, in the best case called the visions, at the worst of the follicle.
But even if the trigger and effect differ, the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet of New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of diamonds, psychosis and hallucinations are imputable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or deliriums when the balance, neurotransmitters of the brain - first of all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - breaks and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delirium thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The Earth's attraction force no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always been concerned about the relationship between folie and dream.
For Aristotle, Hallucinations were a form of wake-up; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatricism, found in 1861 "a great similarity between folie and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, images, delusions and sensory illusions that made it".
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a personalized band.
Its body is in two dimensions with crimson colors.
The Earth's attraction no longer has power over him, he's planning on the edge of the ceiling.
He's feeling a little bit.
Behind him are the devil's creatures of alleys, raping, the mouth enthralled, showing their teeth.
They follow him, give him feet with heavy flammable boots, throw him against the walls, feel pain throughout the body.
Tonite, malicious, screaming, out of walls and radio.
He can no longer support these voices that insult him and humiliate him.
Henning T. drags two cables from his stereo channel, actually a loop and attachs it to a crochet attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a buffle and goes through the hole around the neck.
He's got it.
The hole's broken.
That's what you need to learn, the voices cry in a heart to pull the tampan. "Go to a clinic and make yourself look good!"
Today, 40-year-old Henning T. has lived six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first of nearly 20 years.
It was launched by the LSD.
Diagnostic: psychosis schizophrenic, paranoid, it is also maniaco-depressive, it takes medicines against depression, maniaco-depression.
He has learned to live with his disease, he has been married for three years.
During psychosis I have lived with terrible fears and deep despair.
The illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffer at least once in their schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the internal world and the outside world, they are in a state of hyper-excitement, which causes them to suffer hallucinations, megalomania, relative leaves or persecution.
It is very quick to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are no longer rare.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is buried under the senses.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a marriage of ideas and fantasies from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the CHU Department of Psychiatry of Heidelberg (General Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrene is located in the center of the situation, all in a sense centered on it.
At the same time it is in a passive role, it is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the ability to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, revealing is excluded.
Do the experience once in her life of hallucination.
Unlike the dream, Fuchs says, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality which is perceived during psychosis is basically preserved".
Delicious thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alignment of the vein takes place in a real framework.
Why our brain does this kind of cavalry, it's always unique for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to lose their perception of reality at the moment, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on gums have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers believe that the persons concerned are presenting serious brain injury.
It is assumed that brain neuronal maturity is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is how neuronal system anomalies occur and increase the fact that it has not appeared for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a psychosis trigger, though there is a predisposition.
Even hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain's hot.
What's crazy, Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck tells us, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take honest drugs to escape while others buy expensive drugs to seek them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of viewpoint.
Kasten has been gathering reports on hallucinations and ill image phenomena for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Real World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are part of typical psychosis complications but also a number of other pathologies.
Among them are mental disorders such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, plaque sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or cranial trauma.
It is surprising to note that in some circumstances even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of memory fragments that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the brain areas that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently cool; when our brain is hot but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or psychosis.
But also lack of incentives, stress, love hangers or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, at least one third of the participants admitted that they had experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In 2005 Sarah K. was 16 years old, she lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania before and went to college.
A young girl does everything normal to tell the truth.
If there were no images or voices.
During the recreation, it happens that a young boy, lying, at the long châtian hair, addresses the word to him.
When she answers her friends looking at her, surprised – no one else can see or hear this boy.
They think this shy young girl is a lunar dream, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy as she sees and hears the girl who's sitting next to her on the bank.
It can even discern its present presence.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this young sympathetic.
Am I crazy? See if she asks you sometimes.
But she knows that this young man and other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the appearances are, in general, exhilarating.
Often visions are heavy.
When she's in class, she can't follow the course because she's just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while she's invisible to others and she's obviously explaining equations to the table.
At night the appearances are, in general, exhilarating.
When, in the dark of her room, she waits for the sleep that happens too rarely and too late, she can often not make the distinction if she is awake or dreaming already, if the images she sees, the horrible faces or the young girl with bloodless arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she calls you to these creatures.
She doesn't talk to her parents or her friends, they'd take her for a fool.
Automated 2009. Sarah K. today is 20 years old.
She had her baby last year and she lives with her friend.
One year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Since she's been online with psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she's not crazy.
Folly is also an art work of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough incentives, the probability is that he has hallucinations at some point.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, so it's got animation.
Sarah K., the only girl, was afraid of other children when she was young and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she was 13 years old, that the man she called Father, since she was old enough to think, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and hearing hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience", according to Kasten "a place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
Healthy hallucinations are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that ghosts are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to treat hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too focused on conscience, we are unfortunately quick to take imaginary experiences for pathologists, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief doctor at the Hospital Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but also contains something positive, creative - the leaf is an art work of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of experience called oniroide, a particular form of change in the consciousness revealed by the dream.
Onyroid veins are very complex half-breeds that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and can't differ from the dream even when it's awake.
The state of oniroide consciousness is manifested during trauma or in extreme pathology situations as well as in patients with fully aware polyradiculopathy who experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of himself and of the world, due to a total and permanent inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world which is dissociated from reality.
It's a state of mental limitation between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world takes place, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
In fact, it is an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation, a capacity of organization which is given to us men, so that we do not fall asleep in the wake of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classic, art historian also described his onyroid experiences in his book "The Change of Heart" as an action for the preservation of the soul.
He was 49 years old when he became aware of a several-day journey after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body was sentenced to remain in motion.
Clossen swims in a world that he has created from all parts, visit foreign places, travel in time. He sees an old man ascend into a railway sanatorium, a robot to his head protecting his health.
He lives in the middle of the age among noblemen who manufacture blood-based drugs.
He is taken by a Greek on a motorcycle that carries him to his country, he surfes with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It is completely absorbed in this imaginary world, everything is even later in its memories.
According to Clausen these internal trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is actually a different state, he writes by describing what he has lived.
On the contrary, memories from mental journeys are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and intense than real life.
The intensity of this life reveals the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, the onyroid dialects, psychosis, hallucinations and psychological experiences show us how fragile our internal representations of external reality are even in a state of alertness.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten "may cause a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be very enriching.

Burda
At the age of 27, children will take care of the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment to the Burda edition PDG post is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants her two children to take up the press group, he told Spiegel.
The holding must remain 100 per cent of a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, editor Hubert Burda sees his company between the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at 27 years of age and are firmly determined to integrate the society, said 69-year-old Hubert Burda in Spiegel.
All details have been resolved in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will then be raised.
They will also need to see if they can.
We cannot impose on our children 7500 employees without knowing whether they have the ability to take care of them.
This would waste the children as well as the company.
Burda had recently informed him that he had retired from his post as President-Director-General since January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years old, has been a member of the Governing Council since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
As a result, he is in charge of the Treasury sector, namely that he was responsible for the company's capital, and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also takes the head of the marketing, foreign, printing and financial sector.
So for the first time, this is not a family member who is at the head of the Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to link the next 10 or 15 years."
Burda explains that holding should remain 100% among the family's hands.
The destructions were always in families that were allowed to be trained by a capital boom, which made huge unfortunate speculative speculations, thinking that they could grow ever higher.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I absolutely do not see myself in the country's predecessor role as Springer and I do not intend to be part of these international links like Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Integral beauty
All you can wish for in terms of beauty and wellness, by hand.
This is the ultimate goal of El Corte Ingles, which has just emerged in the commercial center of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary area of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, opens prestigious teachings such as Hedonai, laser epileptic specialist, Spaxion, with its aesthetic relaxation and treatment rooms, Luis & Tachi, couffers, Marina d'Or, which has a sports room, or The Octane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a dining area, with particularly a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner, while overlooking the exceptional views on the capital, or rent the relaxing area for two hours to organize your own "Beautiful Party" with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massage while drinking a cup of champagne.
In total, it is 250 m2 divided into 12 rooms, where you can enjoy the most innovative facial care, body and hydrotherapy.
For example, the cavitation to fight against cellulitis or vibrating platforms.
The sports room also has these devices as well as virtual "trainers" that guide customer steps by offering them a fully customized treatment.
All begins by entering your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Many videos then show us how to properly implement our exercise program.
Her director ensures that 15 minutes (including drying and drying) are enough to work all muscles of the body.
And if, after having done our work, we want to pass through the couffer room, the teacher Luis & Tachi has a room where hair repair rituals, lightness or nutrition are offered, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusion seem to have been the words of order from this urban space, which will be open every day from 10 a.m. to 22 p.m.

Endesa and Barcelona, equipped with electric car
The Endesa electric company, in collaboration with the Barcelona Ayuntamento, created the 'Offiina LIFE'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "Offina LIVE" (Logistics for the Construction of Electric Vehicles) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the installation of the electric car in the city and will put in place agreements on mobility, by taking action, by coordinating, providing subsidies, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electricity cars, collect the opinions and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “Electric Cities ”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
It is three cities selected by the government, within the framework of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
The electric company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generality of Catalonia.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative that Endesa participates in with regard to the promotion of electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has a set of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero interviewed "a future of peace" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, interviewed "a future of peace" for the Spanish car industry which, he recalled, constituted the country's main export sector.
In the submission of the Government's 2009 President's Economic Report, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, we would today have an abbreviation, closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"This plan and the decision of the trade mark to remain in Spain, in a highly competitive sector, allows us to consider a future of peace for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Integral Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), devoted EUR 800 million to 19 manufacturers and 137 subsidiary companies, which mobilized investment of more than EUR 3,000 million.
The Executive Director explained that this investment was both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government support measures for the application, in line with Plan 2000E, in collaboration with autonomous communities and car companies.
According to the President, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and has contributed to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased by "40 per cent" in November.
20 000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Assembly Hall of Cars, a meeting place for professionals and motorists.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Crystal Palace of the Campo de Madrid House.
This is an exposure area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can you find motorcycles and collection cars there, but you will also find it in ClassicAuto Madrid articles of all kinds related to the engine world.
Thus, among the exhibitions of the palace, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, thumbnails, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will bring happiness to collectors and curious people.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among other things, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restaurant, Cupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration, or Cochera Classics, specialist in Mercedes Benz.
External aptitude test
But the business activity of this hall will also include parallel activities: meetings, sports exhibitions, fitness tests, presentations and competitions.
Applicability tests with vehicles and collection motorcycles will also take place on a circuit located outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 stop : A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda understands that the sports spirit is not affected by respect for the environment.
To this end, it has been integrated into Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, baptized i-Stop, a device which, at least for the moment, is only available on engine 2.0 with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note it received in its entirety.
Details, vehicle finish, habitat, behaviour, mechanical, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it appears that existing seats present excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the flightr is also particularly pleasing to him.
Continuing with the entire control and console table, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a future interior design, with many buttons and commands, as well as red and blue living colors.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, are in conflict with the sovereignty of German products, and especially with the Volkswagen Gulf, which all want to survive.
Following the stay, this compact Japanese car offers more than adequate housing to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
This adds a great deal to the regular forms.
The engine's automatic stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available on the engine with two litres and 150 horses and with a manual change of six speeds.
This engine is a real pleasure. It is illustrated by its fineness, its low noise, its performance and the master of its consumption.
In fact, although the most demanding Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not make a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with an essential engine, both for its high-speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, or the one that presents the largest number of serial elements.
Among the series equipment, the road change assistant (RVM) who removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive internal mirror, large-scale monitor, parking controllers, independent air conditioning, rain and light capture, bluetooth and bluetooth audio, as well as 17-point alignment routes, are particularly remarkable.
In addition, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for more than 1,500 euros, includes other components of the bio-xenon adaptable devices and an audio BOSE system with disk loader.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
In particular, it is illustrated by the quality of the materials used, by its behaviour and by its high level of equipment.
Moreover, those who don't make a lot of miles per year will be able to choose for i-Stop version associated only to the lift engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only inappropriate model is its high price, which is between €21,770 for Luxury finish and €23,270 for the tested model, the Sportive.
In contrast to this important sum, Mazda3 will offer us a great dose of satisfaction every day.
"First" of luxury
L.A. covers the red tape of sensuality encarned by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever blubbered, both elegant and sexy models for Nina's exit. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had chosen for a "lady" shadow.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to watch your e-mail, without offering you the opportunity to see certain types of connected parts or to navigate on the Internet.
He enjoys his five minutes of glory in the United States when Time magazine appoints him as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see it in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly subscription and a low monthly subscription, or less than half what costs, for example, the iPhone's date subscription.
In view of its success, the company has launched two new devices: one design exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free live data service, for six times more expensive than Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web is the European version of invention and its third incarnation.
He's as limited as his American brother, but he's a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it is like to give up data when you cross a border or desperately search for a coffee shop on the Wifi (or a background connection) in order to consult your mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and it takes a long time for it to work.
In fact, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have a physical thesis to understand them and good Mondays to read the little characters.
The repeated reminders of the European Commission's order to propose affordable roaming rates across Europe have had an impact on the perception.
Outside of his country of origin, we tend to use data, and we don't hurt.
That a small device such as the FonPeek (is always curious that it's called Fon while it doesn't have Wifi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals to enable them to benefit from their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including downloading books and other online research.
No subscription and no gallery.
It is a connected device and it is paid at its purchase and not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: an option with access to life as Peek is already offered to the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my e-mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer presenting the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
The yellow is undoubtedly the preferred color of the first lady in the United States.
If Barack Obama went to the U.S. presidency with a dress and a handle of this color, she actually chose the same to accompany him at the second moment, no doubt the most important of her life: the return to Oslo at the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama had a very similar model on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow drawing to the green with brilliant reflections, twice, she had three pieces: dress, dress and clothing, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large fraternal or necklace.
Although at first sight, it would seem that the first lady in the United States followed the flag of the Princess of Asturias and chose to return the same things.
But the fabric in which the two sets are scaled makes them very different.
If it was a spaghetti tooth, on the other hand, it would bring to Oslo a printed violet.
The accessories are also different: medium-sized green shoes for the first time, and a similar model, but expensive, this time.
It has also changed: hair has now been raised while it was taking them off the previous time.
75 per cent of working mothers had professional problems due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
This is what is revealed in the study "Fecondity and career of women in Spain", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey, conducted in 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 years, leaves no doubt: 75% of mothers working have seen their limited career due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences as to the start of marriage and the number of children, whether or not women work or not and the type of employment they are employed.
Those who do not have work outside the home, work part-time or have little stable work, get married faster, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, rest their income in marriage and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after being married. This figure goes to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with stable employment needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to restore the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment employed strongly influences maternity, but less the date of the start of a common life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that increases the gap between the age of the marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the training level is, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those who conducted elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"An additional distinction also exists between women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have conducted elementary studies marry and have their first child before finding stable employment, those who have conducted medium or higher-level studies will invest in this programme and give priority to achieving stable work as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child," said Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German actress will load the image of several brand products, then discovering the universal currency "Because I value it well".
Joyeux Noël's protagonist, one of the most elegant actors of the international scene, has come together with other celebrities recorded at the Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before that, the last to be held in this club were the evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
Among men, the cosmetic brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomical lessons) and Matthew Fox (the Gospel partner in Lost).
The prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His greatest representatives, creative and mannequins, from yesterday to today, met for the annual return of their prizes, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed your meeting.
The ex-wife Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chose the best maniac of the year.
The port of Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de Aces (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) a "radiographs" of writers who have passed through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
He does not do so according to the types that are predictable and desirable (biographical summary, life and work), but seeking something similar to the ignition of the created person.
The trip is exciting and Vincent does not spare both the weakers and the lights.
Happily, this book is also an encouraging invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you here for a few moments.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I have discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical pulse, the same as I felt without number: pleasure against the fawning destiny, morality and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, Allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with a poetic humour that bursts, giving meaning, like the sword of the coward who has failed to kill him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted for thirty years, in the flesh of which he conjugates the emotion of the adult to the pleasure of the repute, a spiritual privilege which was to reach heaven by the way of loss."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the eight thousand-meter summits of universal literature, which has to be recorded by the north face, where the best alpineists still hang on."
On William Faulkner: "It was a strange type.
He himself said at times he was the heir of a land owner of the county and at other times he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great. ”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer gathered the cry slowly pushed from a bridge by this Munch character to carry his exodus until the late evening of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he threw it into the flight of himself and calling for follow-up with a speech violent to the Aztecs."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she was angry and prayed: "Dear God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were the words of Spencer: "The sleep after effort,/after the storm of the port,/the rest after the war,/after life, forced the death of the rival."
Regarding Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she also carried her depression.
Her husband agreed very often that she told him that Edward VII was among the azalats or that the birds were singing Greek.
We have never seen such a patient and loving man of a nevrosity whose literary talent exceeded the follicle."
On Pío Baroja: "What happened to Martín-Santos if it wasn't to try to expose Joyce to Baroja?
What's Benet's trying to get Baroja fired by Faulkner?
What did Cela do if this is not to breathe the glory of this man so that he serves him as a pédestal?"
A Long Action
The last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, walked into our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrad, when a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed by her and our dog, a hare, escaped from the SPA and not weighing more than six kilograms, and without saying a word, they set her two legs that left the seriously injured dog.
Our anger is enormous because we do not see what it takes to attack a small animal free of charge which was also left behind.
It is necessary to add to this the denial of a woman who was walking quietly and who, when she abused these individuals, comes to fear for her physical integrity, because an animal attacker is able to do the same thing to a woman, a child, an elderly person or, in the end, anyone less than him.
The episode took place at 17 hours, one Tuesday as another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog's got it all day.
We have heard a complaint against the district's Commissioner, even if we are convinced that it serves as a big shock and not to touch the feelings, we just want to make it clear that the killers were Spanish.
The denial has led us to deny this fact.
We don't understand what's going on among young people so they'll find themselves enjoying the free treatment of an animal that gives us affection, friendship and company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have been passed.
Michelin and Fesvial, assembled for the port of the castle
The designer of Michelin tyres, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the port of the case, mainly for the younger motorcyclists, as indicated today by the two structures.
The purpose of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of the port of the case, since it is the only element of protection to avoid injuries to the head or even death in case of a two-way accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which "is beyond the design and manufacture of products ever safer" and stated that it was contributing to this objective by other educational and information actions.
This new boosting campaign at the port of the case in two routes, under the heading "To be be or not to be", will include a first phase during which displays will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycling garages to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" for the company, since as a manufacturer of two-way tyres, one of its main objectives is to develop more and more safe products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6 per cent compared to 2008 and, most importantly, the first increase after 22 months of reduction, according to the figures of the Afac and Ganvam manufacturer’s parental union.
However, the good news should be highlighted, since the reference to the comparison was particularly bad in November 2008, with a reduction of 60 per cent compared with the previous year.
Consequently, despite the redundancy of the last month, the accumulations during these 11 months are 40 per cent below those of the previous year.
Since January, if all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (tourism vehicles, pick-up vehicles, trucks, light trucks and light trucks) have been sold 95,853.
The major clouds that affect most of their requests are not so much wasted. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay almost 100% of the cases due to external funding.
In addition to restrictions imposed by the limitation of bank credits, other factors such as the increase in unemployment or the persistence of poor economic conditions must be added.
In view of this situation and the difference between the vehicles of tourism, the 2000E purchase aid has not been used.
In addition to individuals, independent and SMEs who want to buy a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, they can also benefit from it, but the number of operations is itself.
Yesterday, in Ganvam, we recalled the need for administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles as well as to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The concessionaires' association provides for a year 2010 similar to that in which it calculates a fall in sales (tourism vehicles and 4x4) of 19 %.
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As this took place with the ABS brake anti-locking system and as it will take place with the SSP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will be a mandatory element on European vehicles.
They are also already mandatory on tourism vehicles and newly registered light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of absence has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure imposed by the European Union is aimed at strengthening the protection of petals, even though it can also contribute to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant shall be responsible for increasing the pressure on brakes in case of emergency detected by the system through the driver's leg cutting.
But the last one doesn't always keep the pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by the Bosch car manufacturer, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to support the brake before collision, and half of them had not benefited from all their efforts.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of aid, in revancha, requires maximum braking system, reducing the distance the vehicle needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularity of the so-called smart emergency braking systems: it is estimated that a left-wing on four with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects the obstacles and prevents the driver from acting slightly on brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps it by increasing pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not respond, and although collision is inevitable, the device makes maximum effort on brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors rest until January of the plan for Opel
While the workers of the company Opel de Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably on 8 – the North American manufacturer warned that it would take more time to complete the Opel relief plan.
Nick Reilly, the new GM President of Europe, believes that each point of the plan has been approved by the party concerned.
This may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to the employers and then to the Governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be reported by the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, we ensure that a decision on Saab's sale should be taken in the next few days.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the Swedish Government has put pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM agrees to be in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidateship of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper's sports cars, supported by the Russian Converg group, is important.
If there were no agreement with them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese Baic company.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
To fly from Porsche Boxster Spyder
In order to design their last and precious beauties, Porsche engineers are part of the Boxster S and have succeeded in threatening nothing less than 80 kilograms, leaving the balance to only 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to take over, firstly, the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual boat roof, which allowed to reduce 21 kilograms, use aluminium doors such as GT3, 15 other kilograms less, remove the air conditioner, 13 kilograms, reduce the fuel tank of 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of winnings, mount sports bags, 12 pounds more, and with 19 pounds of light tires, five pounds.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, which thus won six other kilograms and replaced the taped doors by tapes on top of them, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the double-Embrace PDK box, the test was performed on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on the streets of the California secondary network, in the mountain, with particularly curves.
Its behavior can be described only as irreproachable.
The reduction of weight does not prevent the vehicle from rolling on the ground with an albob.
On the contrary: it has been a long time since we had not tested such a small and light model that at the same time ensures so much safety in the screws, including at high speed.
It's a small athlete, able to complete his small muscle at the necessary time, until we ask him to print, freeze, recover and reboot his engine...
That's what we want. Thanks to its guidance, as well as its specific communication, the car will do what our hands will show on the flight.
And she'll do it with a surgical precision.
Sound of a voluntary engine
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S), is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the "sport" option or through a system that changes engine speed, already used on Panama.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either at the end or during recovery.
Suspension is closed, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The cover of the roads that we traveled with Boyxster Spyder was quite wide, but the car managed well the needles.
E-assistances have been severely active on the whole road, while on some pathways we have found the scarf in the early morning and the gravel later in the morning.
Finally, an ultralege car is the most fun to drive and is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, at a price of EUR 70 831.
“ A Little While Longer ”
An intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional Starlet of the house's dispersions, the singer shows his face of a bad girl with as much content as his Chanel bags.
More than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", it's "Bag Girl".
Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral received a thrilling triumph at 91-82 during his visit to the warm field of Maccabi Elecra, despite the many absences suffered by the team of Dusko Ivanovic. It is thus located in the head of its group, after Mirza Teletovic's great show, which, with eight rounds to three points was the best of its team (29 evaluation).
The Vitoria team has completed the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mikov by a large commitment and collective work dose, even if it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, great skill since the perimeter, with 16 panels to three points marked, is widely determined by the final victory.
The match started quickly for blues and reds, which took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four panels of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter had led to the announcement that they had jumped on the Israeli field with hot pitches.
English and Teletovic were the main artists from 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but Alava's team chose the inner game of Barak and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by complaints and appeals to return to his former home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic had already begun to mark himself as the best player of his team, with 13 points marked, although Splitter's "at least six" evaluations had already announced that this night would not be Brazil's best.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right way to rest, nothing was played, away from there, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria that we didn't get so easily on their ground, and thanks to "the hand of Elias," they managed to get into the match.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the use of light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from dead, needed some capable action to take the air, and at this point, Mirza Teletovic's missile emerged which, with three consecutive panels and the help of English and Ribas, drew the account to a life-threatening score (54-67), and that the locals succeeded in accelerating the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Avala team went out to play all over the last period, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they were not going to let anyone take what they deserved for the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not re-sign and tried to support it from the three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter removed for errors, Ivanovic's players did not precipitate, defend well, and while the Israelites were approached in the last minute (80-85), the party was already playing and the victory fled to Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
The pain prevents Unicaja from giving up the battle
The Unicaja lost his hands in Greece in front of the Olympics and left him head of Group B of the Euroligue, at a match marked by the absence of unicaja players, especially in the inner game (Freland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek win.
The Malaga team has not been shaken by the atmosphere of the pillar of peace and friendship or by the disgrace of the rival, no doubt one of Europe's most powerful and rich budgets.
The first quarter-time game enabled the Andalusians to dream. A three-point aggressive defense, two of Major Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who exploded the local team 12-18 at the ninth minute.
The Olympics were surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the internal game of Bourousius, Vujcic and Schortsanitis allowed to reverse score 22-20, at the third minute, when an action, a start of boxing, between North American boys Beverley and Williams, led to the disqualification of two players.
The Greek team began to operate by showing superiority in both camps, while the release of the English Pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal faults were on the Unicaja.
The internal players and the Lithuanian Alliance Linas Kleizas, with their three-point panels, crossed the 44-32 advantage at the nineteenth minute.
A Remountable
The third period was particularly offensive to the Olympics, which, despite the 19 losses, would appear higher and even reach the difference between the meeting held in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, leaving the group head dead.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last exit from the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, to Cook's three-point panels, and Lewis' support, left some hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But it was practically impossible to win because Olympics seemed unplaceable when players pressed and showed their superiority in centimetres in the area.
The Croatian Pivot Nikola Vujcic succeeded in rebuilding the score at 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja is subject to the victory of the Olympics.
How much should you pay for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the pay they would deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Find, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate ads, employment and vehicles in Spain.
The tool "How much should you pay?" calculates users' salaries from more than 140 000 jobs available in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
A week after the application works, the search engine found that in general, the Spanish worker "has been paid badly" explained in a communication to the owner of the products of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovità from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least paid.
A British IT programmer received 45 226 Euros per year and a Frenchman, 31,059, while a Spanish received 24 000 Euros.
Similarly, a driver received 34 247 euros gross annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Find, the lowest paid job in Spain is the servant, with 11,592 net annual euros, followed by the seller, with 14,725 euros, and the worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most researched jobs on the Internet in the last three months are driving, mid-term and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Government of Brazil has set a time limit for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The vice-president shall no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, responsible for the affairs of Brazil's embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed on Global TV that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been refugee since 21 September, before that date.
"He realized that he had to start on 27 January, following his mandate, he must seek another destination."
The chain also quoted the former official, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is from the earliest possible point of view, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the 29 November elections (for which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya made sure that he would remain in Brazil's embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to find refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed, as Zelaya refused the political exclusion condition that would impose upon him the government of fact presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the last few days since the spring, during which the inflation of assets has become the dominant note on the markets, uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising because it is their natural state, in an environment where the agents make decisions about a future by uncertain nature.
The drug used by the central banks to stabilize the markets was to finance the debt by direct and indirect purchase of assets by providing sufficient liquidity at close zero rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been practically completed and, without giving rise to their non-compliant liquidity policy, begin to put some sand in the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their bid for a year next week.
As a result, investors doubt the global economy's ability to maintain economic relaxation without heterodox measures and we are helping to invest in reducing risk premiums.
The volatility of interest rates and differences in corporate obligations is again increasing, although they remain very far from the abnormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States are committed to socializing the private risk and the public debt is again affected.
There is a renewed involvement in quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refugees chosen by investors, leading to an increase in the differences between the euro area and Germany.
Spain was severely affected by this instability episode, but then Standard & Poor'sa was threatened by a new revision of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad enough to discourage moral risk defenders, who were once again trying to raise a case of conscience among those responsible for global economic policy that had undermined the destructive effects of the restriction of credit on the destruction of employment, while a new day of grace should be described.
However, the situation in Dubai is like a tribal struggle between the emirs to redefine its place to power in the emirs and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that exposes a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
It was sold in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly unreasonable for Ecofin to save Hungary from a lack of respect for its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area member country not to respect its commitments.
On the contrary, it is logical that Ecofin has influenced the Greek Government in transparency and makes its citizens aware of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are facing a transition risk premium normalization episode, after some overruns in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as our public debt gap increases to the extent of the obligations of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If European differences were to decrease and we were to continue to increase, then there would be a Spanish idiosyncrasy risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is anecdotes. When our forecast indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their relaxation models and to review their projections for 2011, including OECD and the European Commission, which return to charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not raise much hope for their warning.
Again, this has all the air to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment “wisdom is the mother of certainty”.

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the Sub-Commission of the Congress of Members, where the energy strategy of Spain has been discussed these days for the next two decades.
After his intervention, which was followed by the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán appealed for the press what he had mentioned in front of the Sub-Commission at eight o'clock.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 million euros by 2020 and 60 000 million more between this date and 2030, in case the nuclear power stations are still in operation today.
If that were not the case, the necessary investments would not be up to 60,000 million but up to 95 000.
In contrast, Iberdola believes that investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity for the next decade, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
Since 2020, the issue has changed, and power will need to be increased.
Its pari focuses on both gas and carbon centres, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this regard, it considers that more than 18,000 MW are needed, with other "supported energy".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economic Act that the Government has come to approve is in line with what it claims to do, did not want to attack the Royal Decree aimed at encouraging national carbon consumption, which is contrary to climate warming policies.
According to him, there is “a clear, long-term parallel” in this sense, despite the “punctual” measures, as the President of Iberdrola has qualified them.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although they are long-term, must begin to be taken, because they will take some time before they reach maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Railways received the air Lingus maintenance market in ten airports
The Swiss Swiss company Swiss Sport, the Railway Office for Land Airports, will play the role of a privileged partner from the Irish Air Lingus, for goods services in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been disclosed, has been five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Board of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Centre for Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation.
The alliance provides for an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to do research on energy efficiency on roads and airports.
Actiona argues its first route in Australia to Hochtief and Bouygues
Actiona is struggling for its first concession car in Australia, a market on which she already works as a water and energy company.
The game room is a tunnel estimated at $1,700 million (about €1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option to allow Actiona to be established in the country as a public and concessionary company.
The mayor of the city wishes to be able to make it available for the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, within a business plan under the auspices of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be charged with the canteen and the operation of the pajamas.
At the time of the submission of their tenders in May, the planned investment amounted to $1,700 million (about €1,047 million) and in the last phase three consortiums, with a significant presence of European builders.
The baptized group Transcity is led by Actiona, the only Spanish company in line, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground work.
Against the Actiona team, the Northern Direct Consortium is built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction team Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (the company of the German builder Hochtief, which is located around the participation of the ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (the property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Galloese company specialized in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great opportunities and privatizations, but it is a major challenge if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by Hochtif and Bilfinger companies, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, remains an invalid step for the Spanish genders in the sector.
ACS has been able to win a position on this market by participating 30% in Hochtief, owner of Lighton.
Millions of assets
Action on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a broad presence through its energy supplier and desalination activities.
Among other things, it has the largest oleanic park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and runs the group of companies responsible for the erection and management of the Adelaide desalinizer, with a budget of 700 million.
It now aims to consolidate these two areas and to benefit from synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground road, promoted by the City of Brisbane and Northern Link Infrastructure Office (Northern Link), is called to link the western road from Toowong to the Peripheric Road to Kelvin Grove (see map), 4 km from the tunnel. This is the largest project available to reduce traffic coverage in Brisbane.
The calendar established by the administration indicates that the tender will take place during the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December of the coming year.
Despite the fact that this pedestrian road will be opened at the end of 2014, it is not provided that the canteen is completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will consist of two ways, an electronic braking system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will provide US$500 million (EUR 308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make Hochtief widely fruitful, which mentioned yesterday the acquisition of a contract with the government estimated to 154 million.
The company held by ACS will, through its local Leighton branch, equip the infrastructure of the national high-density fibre network.
This intervention will allow 400 000 people to have rapid Internet access and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has dropped the construction project of the King George Tour of 27 floors in the city of Brisbane. The work has not started yet and Hochtief has completed the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more specifically in Manchester, it will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC can contribute to a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine branch, can contribute to the construction of a 2.1 km tunnel for a road in Slovenia for a amount of EUR 64.5 million.
The company received this contract a few days after it was charged with the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel, Austria, for a total of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the canteen is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore can contribute to the publicity of Renfe
Renfe entrusted the advertising and marketing services of these two years to Ms. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, indicated the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been elected from 16 agencies who have been present at the appeal organized by Renfe, of which four have been finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
An amendment of 63 million in France Télécom to freeze competition
The French competition regulator has influenced an amendment of EUR 63 million in France Télécom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition on fixed and mobile telephones by signing exclusive agreements, by tariffs and by consumer loyalty programmes outside the regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopole and still a state undertaking, has accumulated more than €450 million in amendments since 1994, due to the obstacles it has placed on its competitors.
The sanctions imposed yesterday were also increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom committed similar crimes in the past and is therefore recidivisive.
An application store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile phone branch has followed the lead of other operators and has opened an Internet application shop, with the aim of increasing revenue that does not come from voice transmission.
At the start, the Orange application shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait 2010 for it to take place in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the League of Champions has reported 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation.
The League of Champions has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, the Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, which placed them in the third and fifth positions of the clubs that won the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is head of the list.
Manchester United is head of the list.
Gaining the League of EAFRD Championships brings not only glory but also one of the main sources of income for large clubs.
In fact, the competition allocated EUR 5,362.5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to information provided by the EAFRD.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served in this department.
The white club was the third of the continent to touch the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, has won the trophies three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former Cup of Europe in 1992, is the fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are the Manchester United and Munich Bayern, the two teams that also contributed the most to their participation in the final League of Champions.
And that's what they lost in front of the Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with respect to the money reported by the League of Champions, although it has won more than anyone else (five, while Italy has won four, three England and two Germany).
Distribution
This paradox appears to be explained by the complex procedure for money-sharing applied by the EAFRD.
This year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini is planning to win 1,090 million thanks to the League of Champions.
Of this amount, the EAFRD will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs participating in the classification matches (including the Athletics of Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who were able to participate received 3.8 million just to be there, more than €550 00 per match.
There is also a bonus in the case of victory (EUR 800 000) and equity (EUR 400 000 per team). Those who arrive at the eighth end receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive at the fourth quarter receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will receive 4 million each.
And the champion will win 9 million, facing the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, as part of fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million and at least 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça has won 2.5 million in August for the Super Cup of Europe.
In addition, there are variable payments, which are devoted to 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and it has four attractive places.
The previous year's champion won 40% of the money affected, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed the details of the purchase of shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9 per cent of Sos's capital.
A percentage which does not require him to launch a public procurement offer (OPA) for the whole of the securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per action, which will be awarded in 10 years and which will be paid at a rate of 1 % per year for this report.
Yesterday, Sos’ actions ended at EUR 1,85 ; New Rumasa’s offer therefore assesses the company’s 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1,50 reflects the real assessment of Sos.
The offer is provided by the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group of Jerez provides a 15-day period for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
The CMMV has not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Matthews stated that it had contacted the regulator.
If there were, the decline would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Ours continues to restructure its direction.
In an attempt to stay outside any offer of purchases and vas and become judges of its former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar announced the election of María Luis Jordá as head of internal audit.
A decision by the first woman to take a lead post in the food business.
This is a newly created post that will depend directly on the group's president.
And it is not without politicism, as the company remains subject to the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
In addition, the possibility only in the coming months of the next month's Revelation of new changes in funds cannot be ruled out.
With regard to Salazar credit, former consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega ( representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) announced yesterday before the National Auditorium that they had been informed of the destruction of 212 million unaccompanied.
The CMMV authorises the OPA for the exclusion of Paterina presented by Inversora Mer
The National Market of Values Commission (CNMV) approved yesterday the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paterina on 9 October.
The monitoring body explained that it had authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the applicable standards and that it would consider the content of the explanatory note submitted, following the amendments made on 2 December last.
The CMMV stated that the offer relates to the acquisition of 550,008 shares by Federico Paterina at a price of 7,65 euros per share, representing 8,95% of social capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been mobilised and that they could not be transmitted in any way before the end of the offer, which he indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paterina, in accordance with the provisions of the existing standards.
New Car Exploration Tools
In these days of bad times and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have a left side are brought to a garage, where an expert must assess the damages and the cost of repair.
Each left is different, and calculating the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complex work.
To calculate the cost of repair between EUR 20 000 and EUR 30 000, including parts and working hands, may take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the help of the most recent computer tools, this would be a matter of minutes.
That is why nearly 100% of experts use this type of system.
Providers of services and solutions for the evaluation of leftovers and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then treating them and offering them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audadex, of the North American Solera group, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other competing companies in the field of assessment and information development tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex's trade director, the company in Spain has 63 manufacturers and importers, each providing them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, although over the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been launched than during the previous 15 years.
When a new car comes to the market, these companies are working.
This is a very expensive job because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle must be catalogued and recorded at its price.
In addition, an "intellective" graphic image is set out for each model on which you can click on the different parts of a car.
If this is a massively sold model, work can be ready in one week if the process progresses very fast.
If this is a low-sale car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audadex has full information on 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models are information on Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99 per cent.
In order to carry out the documentation and development of the databases, Audadex has eight centres across the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each is specialized in certain brands.
The national seat is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (generally mechanical experts) work together on three screens of computers.
Audadex invests 90 million dollars each year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and clients receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to provide different uses and offer different products.
The most common application concerns repair and maintenance, but according to the countries, there are also tools for the management of catacombs or to calculate the criminal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide on the value of car rentals in Spain is Eurotax.
Audadex does not propose it in our country, but does it to the United States.
For products offered by Audadex, it is easy to imagine the type of support it can offer to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the product being AudaPlus, the standard left-wing evaluation solution for experts.
There are cars, motor vehicles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the times of repair estimated by the manufacturer or paint bars.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is €5.75 for customers using it at least 10 times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which performs thousands of experts, negotiates its price with Audadex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it comes from the mounting chain, only through its cassette number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle windows, and AudaSubbastas is an open service to the Internet professional sector that allows you to engage in vehicles that have been declared dangerous.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, carry out geo-demographic analyses or identify current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand are going to the garage for a panel or how many large leftovers for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It commercializes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the parts, prices and official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Insa group, founded in 1971, as a service provider and evaluation of leftovers, pans or maintenance solutions.
The GT assessment guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased by 20% per year over the past three years and has increased by EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of the last year, she initiated her internationalization process with the establishment of an office in Paris.
On his side, Audadex was born in Germany in 1966 and was implemented in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is carried out in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38% remain in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.
The global business figure for the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3 per cent more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive EUR 19.1 million, or 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was awarded $1,000 million, today its actions are assessed at a total of $2400 million.
Since 2007, it has been near the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Infringements on the Internet of Accidented Cars
In the last month of October, the Solera group bought AutoOnline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motor vehicles and left-wing special vehicles.
The operation involved a cost of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year to 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to provide more value added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an enormous international market.
This estimate and sales service is exclusively addressed to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cashiers and professional vendors who must be registered before they start operating.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and operates more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, including 500 000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
More than 1500 vendors and 4000 experts are currently available on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose case number has been withdrawn can no longer travel, but on the contrary, some non-absemable parts can be used as replacement parts.
The collection vehicles may be re-registered, although they have been withdrawn after complex movements.
Four-stage storage period
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user receives a loan in only four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the replacement area, create a loan and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are resistant to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 all-ground, 137 motors, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and Internet connection are required.
Once the model to repair identified by its cassis number, a real graphic picture of the model in question appears then the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the labour price, increases or reductions, and can print the loan to return it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the person assigned to the garage does not include the estimated working hours.
The cost of using this garage tool is EUR 350 per year, which can be used for a credit.
Currently, the Audadex company works for these images to be three dimensions.
This is an innovation that the mechanics see from a very good eye, as it will, for example, allow you to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
