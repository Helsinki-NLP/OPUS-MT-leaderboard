The Guardian reports that the Chinese social network TikTok has been subjected to video censorship, which refers to the area of Taiwan, the independence of Tibet or the banned religious group of Faulung.
The documents published indicate that the owner of TikTok (byteDance) (byteDance) is promoting the foreign policy objectives of China abroad.
The main part of the violations of China's policy falls under the “incineration of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok places inappropriate publications in the context of general rules so that social networks do not appear to be censorious.
For example, the ban on the criticism of the socialist system of China falls under a general ban on “crisis or attacks on the policy and social rules of any country such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system etc.”.
The ban on the mention of incidents in the Tianman region or genocide in Cambodia falls under "the history of China or other countries".
The document also contains a list of the prohibited names of twenty "foreign leaders or public actors", including North Korean leaders Kim Chen Ira, Kim Ir Sen and Kim Chen Ina, Indian politics Mahatmu Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Trappa and Baraka Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Sindzo Abé, South Korean President Pak Ken Hi, Indonesian President Jack Vido and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as indicated in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by the administrators of the socket and may be withdrawn from the user's blockade.
Not too strict is the second category: such publications remain on the website, but their distribution is limited by the TikTok algorithms.
The representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules were old and no longer applied: "We are now using a localized approach as well as attracting independent local specialists."
The Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publication, reports the developer of the Producer Centre of the Russian Goddanov.
The "Producer Centre" is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All the advertising material of the Bloggers "Producer Centre" agrees with the representatives of the Société, but the user materials can be placed without consent, is passed on to the Goddess.
On whether it is possible to speak of politics or Putin in TikTok, the Goddess responds positively and says he has seen such publications.
The founder of Our Digital Roman Zaripov agrees with Goddess: "The main rules for TikTok users are set out in the user agreement: no shocking content, discriminatory expressions and so on."
Under these rules, however, any content that does not like moderators can be submitted to Zaripov.
The Zaripova Agency is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide is over 500 million, 40 per cent of which are younger than 18 years old.
According to the User Agreement, only persons under the age of 13 can use TikTok.
Société administrators check their age with artificial intelligence: the neiriety analyzes people and determines how many years a person looks at Goddanese.
If the virus decides that the user is younger, his account may be removed, it will add.
According to the RBC, in September 2019 ByteDance opened an office in Moscow in the area of WeWork.

"Barcelona" threatened Nimara
The Spanish Barcelona and her former Brazilian footballer Nemar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the French attack in Paris, St. Germany.
The case was almost brought before the court, but the Catholics proposed that the game be resolved without interference from Femida.
Otherwise they refuse him to return.
Nemar and his smart father, also an agent of Brazil, took an interest in the focus: under the Barsey agreement signed in 2016, he was expected to receive EUR 40 million.
However, during the year, the Forvard was in the PSP for recorded EUR 222 million.
Nevertheless, he received 22 million from Catholics and now he wants to take the remaining 18.
At the same time, Brazilian lawmakers insist that the club should still pay interest.
When it became known in the capital of Catalonia about Niamara's claims, Barcelona made a meeting request.
The Sine-Grants insist that the bonus was expected to implement the entire contract from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club considers the game to be worth a quarter of EUR 40 million and requires the return of the proportion of the first payment.
But it's most interesting that during the summer, Niamar and Barsa almost agreed to return the "dang" game to the Catalonian.
True, the deal has failed, but hope for a return transition remains.
And this is how Sports.Ru, referring to insinators, told the game's representatives that if financial claims were not settled in court, it would rule out the possibility of returning to Brazil.
Nemar himself wants to come back so much that he asked for guarantees that the Catholics would buy it back.

How to increase future pension and not rework
It is possible to pay pensions not only to the IMF Pension Fund but also to non-governmental pension funds.
NPFs are private companies, reports Volgograd's Truth.ru.
They work as a contribution: you make contributions, the fund invests them, and in time they return your money with interest.
If you are interested in this approach, you have started to study information about NPF on the Bank of Russia website.
All funds are working on the same rules as federal laws.
Pension balls can be purchased by law.
The number of missing balls depends on how many years you will not be able to pay your pension.
This approach applies to those who have worked informally.
In addition, contributions can be made for your relative, for example, for a housewife.
Recommendation for those who are thinking about retirement at the beginning of their career.
An increase in pension payments is received by staff of services, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who have worked for a certain number of years in the Northern Hemisphere.
In order not to give up on the age of retirement, take care of it.
Buy real estate, currency, securities, deposit money on deposits.
The most important thing is to keep up your financial literacy.

Three Mass Disorders
"The Moscow case" against the participants of the summer protests rather than further, is more significant than any particular fragment and is losing political momentum.
The evidence of the very fact of “mass irregularities” is not verified, but in the absence of a political decision to file this case on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the removal of charges.
The breakdown of the case should be encouraging to society, but the trustee would leave a final breakdown of the forces whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence were in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining defendants of 212 UC (mass orders) was unexpectedly released from prison without any obligations, and after a few hours and rehabilitated: the SCR had withdrawn his charges.

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help to prolong youth?
The subject of phytoandrogens is under investigation.
One of the most famous is the spider's spider.
And these phytoestrogens have been studied very well and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (including heart disease, some types of cancer).
Known sources of phytoestrogens are all beekeepers (the most popular soybean), hammel, seed slow.
Many experts, however, believe that such BADs cannot be a complete substitute for natural hormones.
No such additions can be excluded.
For example, their acceptance may be reduced by the production of own hormones because there are too many analogues outside the body.
The believers called for the revenge of the Castra Praetoria Janis.

I wish for them the best and I believe that the authorities of the city will return them to their home club."

Unknown oil spills have been discovered on the beaches in northeastern Brazil
Oil five unknown origins were discovered on 99 beaches north-east of Brazil.
The plagues of pollution were spread over two thousand miles [2,000 km] of the coastal line.
Reports of the first oil five discovered began on the second September.

The Brazilian Institute of Environment conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turned out that they were all identical, and it's about crude oil.
The Petrobras State Oil Corporation, which had been transferred to the analysis of the samples found, stated that they were not in conformity with the oil obtained from the territories of Brazil.
"It's a thick oil.
It may be removed from one of the vessels after cleaning the tankers.
Many continue to do so.
And almost everything was in the ocean," said the Brazilian news portal G1 coordinator of the oil industry in Pernambucu and Paraiba Rožerio Almeida.
He also added that, despite the ban on this practice, many ships continue to collect waste in the open sea.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected countries in the north-east of the country, environmental defenders discovered nine seabeds fully covered with oil.
And only two of them survived.
In the near future, the Brazilian Institute of Environment, together with Petrobras, will begin cleaning contaminated beaches.
As long as the Institute's experts recommend that tourists and local residents treat oil on the fifth side and report all detected contamination.

Russians don't want to retire - B. Matvienko
The secretary of the Federation of Valentina Matvienko believes that the Russians do not have sufficient savings in order to fully implement the draft law on guaranteed pension products in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions by means of personal collections in the world is sufficiently widespread.
Another case of how timely her introduction is for us.
"In my view, there are now a large part of the population with income that is just going to give them something to increase pension security in the future," said B. Matvienko.
The Russians, according to the speaker, could not understand the mechanisms for the formation and payment of pensions because “permanent changes in this area have led them to their end”.
This does not mean that I am opposed to improving the pension system that regulates its legislation.
“Russia is a social State, and we are obliged to do everything we can to improve the pension, social protection of citizens.
But the steps in this direction must be reasonable, responsible, taking into account the realities of the country,” said B. Matvienko "RIA News".
The head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (the guaranteed pension product bill) was to be developed, several basic principles, including voluntary, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and State responsibility for the preservation of pension accumulations, should be required.
On 6 September, the Ministry of Finance of the IMF announced that the draft Act on Guaranteed Pensions (GDP) would be rejected.
Among its main elements are the exclusive voluntary arrangements for the admission of citizens to the collection system, the guarantee of long-term pensions by citizens by the State, the registration of corrupt accounts of citizens by the central administrator, the tax benefits for businesses and the tax accounts for citizens.

The training at the end of the season is not expressed, so they can be served in tea.
"More than that, packages don't always include tea plants," Tikhonova said.
She said that it would be better to refuse the use of such a drink for the benefit of tea on paper sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packaging tea is not only in composition but also in the production method of it, micro particles are burning up to high temperatures, so they can start distributing harmful substances.

The regions were invited to share business support by secretaries
As the Parliamentary Journal has become known, on 27 September, the President of the Federal Economic Policy Committee, Andrey Kutopov, sent a letter to the Minister for Economic Development, Maxim Oreskin, and finance Minister Anton Siluanov, proposing to express his position on the Federation ' s initiatives to improve legislation in support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
The need for interregional communication
The Federal Council Committee on Economic Policy has provided information from regions on the ongoing business development and legalization programmes of self-employed persons, as well as on the results of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions had told the senators about the development problems of ISP and had made proposals for improving existing legislation.
“Today the communication between regions is insufficient, as a result of the lack of information on regional business development programmes in general across the country has been identified by the enterprise community in all regions of the visit to senators,” noted Andrey Kutev.
In the annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments in the areas of self-employment law and combined data from the regions with proposals and issues (adapted).
In addition to professional ministries, data collected from regions are also addressed to the leaders of regional executive authorities.
The exchange of information on positive work done in the regions could provide insights into the overall development of enterprise.
The first step towards such an exchange will be to send information to the Economic Policy Committee," said the Senator of Parliament.
Effective experience
Today, in many regions, support programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises have been adopted and successfully implemented.
For example, in the Vologo field, the Centre works in support of enterprises, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in the certification of ready-made products.
In the Ivan area, a business support system was developed to implement the principle of one window through multifunctional centres.
In the Krassandar region, agricultural consumer cooperation is provided with grants from the local budget.
In the Orlov area, the center of cluster development is functioning.
The Amurish area under the federal project “Accessation of small and medium-sized enterprises” provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators established on the basis of existing non-governmental co-curing centres through the federal budget.
A number of other regions have special support measures for youth enterprise.
The suicides continue to emerge from the darkness
In the view of regional authorities, a number of changes should be made to the existing legislation in order to support small and medium-sized enterprises more effectively.
For example, the Algerian region suggested that the term "self-employment" should be replaced by "business" because it was "the most appropriate form of public service to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens".
In the Javan area, it was considered necessary to amend the list of activities undertaken by self-employed citizens, including those for the separation and repair of living facilities, for the maintenance of buildings, for physical training.
The coastal area considers it important to strengthen control of poorly trained dairy producers through the mercury veterinary system.
In the Costa Rica and Magadan areas, however, the concept of "social enterprise" and the focus of support for social enterprise are strengthened in the field of law.
All proposals from regions will be taken into account in the preparation of public programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and most importantly to achieve development in specific legislation.
“All proposals from regions will be taken into account in the preparation of public programmes for support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and most importantly in the development of specific legislative projects,” Andrey Kutov said.

" Sanctions" in Russia fell 100 times
In the RF Government, the supply of agricultural products and food in Russia from countries falling under the Russian food embargo has been estimated to have declined more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent by the President of RF Vladimir Putin, 31 000 tonnes of production against 3 million 442.2 000 tonnes for the same period were imported from the countries of the sanctions in the first half of 2019.
The import price fell to $226.5 million from $4 billion,975.5 million, respectively.
It's about supplies of goods that didn't fall under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the quantities prohibited from imports of the product were compensated for increased imports from the countries of the PRC, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.
It is recalled that, by the end of August, the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the period of application of the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs prohibited from entering Russia in response.
The document on the Official Legal Information portal noted that the time limit for the implementation of the rules had been extended for one year from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
The regulation on the destruction of the sanctions had been applied to production from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, from 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, from 1 January 2016 to Ukraine had joined this list.
The Putin Decree on the Elimination of Unlawful Import into the Country of Sanctions (products falling under the food embargo imposed by Moscow in response to the Western Anti-Rossion Sanctions) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government has allowed for the destruction of "cancer" food by any legal means.
As Western sanctions are maintained, the IMF has also extended its response measures.
In addition, this measure does not extend to products imported by citizens for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to imports of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council, to the President of the IMF on the development of civil society and human rights, Michael Fedotov had previously referred to the “unethical” destruction of food products, which he said had a negative impact on human education.
Moreover, in the initiative to prohibit the destruction of food suitable for use, Rosporebnadsor made his statement early in June.
The Human Rights Council then gave similar recommendations to the President of the RF.

In Chile, telescopes began to build at 1 billion euros
This is reported by TASS with reference to the European South European Press Service (ESO).
As ESO reports, this week the construction of a building tower was officially started, where the E-ELT telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) will be located, up to the most expensive and ambitious earth-based project.
Its total value, according to ESO estimates, will exceed billions of euros.
Most of these funds will be lost in the production of equipment and construction of the observatory.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large circle, which will be approximately 39 meters.
It will be collected from 798 six-wheel segments of 1.4 metres.
This huge circle, as well as two supporting surfaces of a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT to get the first detailed photographs of the planet outside the solar system, star in other galaxies, and search for Earth ' s two.
In addition, scientists are trying to use this observatory to monitor sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the centre of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome has only begun, the sawmills, the scientific tools and other components of the observatory have been developed by scientists, engineers and other specialists for three years since the first E-ELT construction plans were announced.
The main circuit contract, with a total value of around EUR 400 million, was awarded by the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
