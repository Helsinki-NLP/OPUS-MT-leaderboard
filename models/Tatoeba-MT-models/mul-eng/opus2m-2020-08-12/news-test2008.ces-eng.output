Inflation in Europe has resulted in food
The acceleration of inflation in the euro area is due in particular to a steady increase in food prices.
The price growth in the 13 euro area countries was expected to increase by 2.6 per cent in October after annual inflation was recorded 3.1 per cent, announced by the Luxembourg statistical office of the Union.
The official proposal proposed only 3 per cent, sent by Bloomberg.
Unlike the American, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the basic rate by reducing the prices of raw materials and reducing unemployment resulting from inflation.
The ECB would like to maintain the rate of inflation below two per cent, especially in their proximity.
According to one of the analysts, the ECB is in an absurd situation: inflation must be "adjusted" so that there is no business to do this later.
In Germany, November inflation represents 3.3 per cent of the fifteen-year record; in Spain, it then rose from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area was rising due to the rapidly rising prices of food and energy.
The terminal prices of wheat rose by 88 per cent, and soybeans also reached the highest prices since 1973.
Similarly, there was a need to pay much more for oil and milk products in 2007.
The price of robbery on global markets has fallen by 52 per cent this year and last month, one barrel of black gold has become almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation decreases in 2008 from 2.1 per cent in 2008 to 2.5 per cent in the year, while in 2009 it is now almost 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate will remain approximately 3 per cent in the next 3-4 months, although its average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, it is expected that the ECB will double the rate rate during 2008.
Gallup sees the government crisis
The range of bidders has grown significantly since the beginning of December, and so now it has been available as the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Gallup Institute's socialists it has never reached a low - 13 per cent support.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71%) support for MSDP’s five-year support.
The MDF and SZDS are based on a study under the threshold for entry into Parliament: their support for the whole population is 2%.
Among certain party voters are the tenants of both camps about one percent more.
The public's view on the economy has also deteriorated in view of the previous minimum - it has never been the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be very bad, so high - 41 per cent, while another 46 per cent is quite bad.
The families will assess their material situation after years of more promising views of pessimistics.
With regard to the next year, most of the population will be counted with further deterioration and only ten with improvement.
In December 71% of the respondents, which is most of all the Gallup Institute's research, found that the Prime Minister is doing his job worse than good.
Ferenci Gyurcsani believes or believes very much in 13% of the respondents, while in Victor Orbán, 38% of the bidders.
The Prime Minister does not believe 54 per cent, the President's arrest of Fides 27 per cent.
One of the indicators for the development of the political situation is how much of the public is thought to be able to solve the conflict with the prime minister without change in the government.
While the government and the prime minister were considered to be demanding 35 per cent after the London October peacekeepers, the share was currently only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) were concerned only with the issue of new elections.
In the interest of the referendum, it is significant that 60 per cent of the respondents responded to the question concerning their appropriate participation in the referendum and that the other 20 per cent indicated that it was likely to be.
For comparison, "the parliamentary elections of these Sundays" would certainly only take part in 55 per cent and the other 15 per cent would consider their participation likely. The success of the referendum would be inevitable on the basis of the current ideas.
It would mean not 74, 79 doctor fees and 84% hospital stays.
If we look at the same parts only in the area of people who are definitely promising their participation, then the introduction of school fees, medical fees and hospital leave 81, 84 and 89 per cent.
The most dangerous is Auchan, almost five times Tesco.
Hypermarkets in the Budars business triangle kept low, on average 16% increase in prices by the difference that this year did not result in an increase in DPH.
The daily economy of the article
The average daily consumption of Napi Farmažás daily in the Budars business year grew by 16 per cent, while in all hypermarkets there was a need for an increase of more than thousands of forints.
Since the prices in supermarkets are already high in December, there has been no such drastic distortion in view of the previous high-level basis.
For consumers, however, it is certainly not happy that what the elephants could buy at a price of less than nine thousand forints is now not worth ten thousand.
The necessary harvest of the daily economy in the hypermarkets has exceeded the psychological limit of at least 91 forts.
The highest cost of hair was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003 there was a consumption of 6 800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained the same at the slow level, but they were very impressed by the harshness of the chests, tails, and also the mackerel.
The prices of bread and butter were similar to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139.
The competition did not go with the price of the product below 200 forints.
Similarly, in this trade it was surprising that the price of two- U.S. Coca Coly in its mouth was less than 200 forints, so the production was based on only 257 forints.
However, this year he ate the daily Napi Farmhouse Auchan as the most expensive, while Cora as the cheapest.
According to our estimates, the prices figures in the consumer basket of Napi Farmers have grown in the light of the prices of the wool of the Christmas Cora by 15, while Tesco and Auchan are approximately 18 per cent.
In comparison, the highest annual and lowest consumption of the goat was 12 per cent, while the increase between the lowest and the highest annual rate was 21 per cent.
In the morning there was an increase of 1,480.
The average increase in the price of wool was 1,206 forints, with the price of wool on Christmas was affected by the increase in DPH.
In fact, this process of trade has opened up, trade houses have apparently not been able to determine how large price fluctuations are to be established in individual products, as they have not been able to predict the impact of price changes on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of the product in question wrong, it may benefit significantly due to the price fluctuation of the adjusted speed.)
Due to DPH, the rise in the daily price of the consumed goat by Napi Farmasz has been so extreme that the price of the most expensive goat was 1,720 forints over 2006, while at the lowest price difference of 844 forts.
This year no national difference was observed, the most expensive goat has now become 1,630 forints more than elephants and the lowest of 1,284 forints.
Compared to the two holiday seasons, the most disastrous price growth has occurred, with daily consumption in hypermarkets more than 30 per cent in less than 20 months.
(In addition, it does not fully confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office: it intended for several basic foods to increase prices by more than 30 per cent over 12 months.
In addition to molluscs, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the consumption of the daily economy, it seems impossible, as the price of the product, quite expensive already in the past year, has shown, on the basis and in the worst case, the price growth of more than 10 per cent.
Additive molluscs are concerned by all the stronger positions than the adding eggs, the drastic increase in prices has led them to spread in international networks.
Hypermarkets don't complain about the trade gold triangle, they're still referring to a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in the three visited businesses are no longer interested in prices.
They're buying all the quantities, sustainable food takes on wages.
In the middle of the afternoon, long fronts were created in all three supermarkets, as the number of visitors soon grew.
As we know, abroad is a lower business, more international network companies complain that the markets remain behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of sustainable consumer goods.
In many places it is checked on disinfectants
More than a thousand cases of infection have been recorded in hospitals this year, especially due to the inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hygiene conditions of the hospital, filling the bed, overloading staff do not help, says the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places it's also being checked on disinfectants.
Recently, there was a diagnosis of MRSA infection in St. Jan's hospital in the traumatological department.
Bacteries resistant to antibiotics have been detected in men who were diagnosed with serious transport accidents in the hospital.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same place at the beginning of the year.
The patient was injured in a serious car accident was released home, but soon thereafter he had to return with the MRSA infection and because of the bacteria in his body there was no significant operation yet.
By 10 December the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance was reported to have 1,094 cases of multiple-resistance infections caused by disease, told Karolina Böröczová, head of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistance origins have been recorded in patients with safety, not known to others.
Nearly two thirds (683) infections were caused by MRSA, or methicylin-oxacilin, a resistant gold staphylocoma.
Bacterii Staphylococcus aureus (SA) carries three thirds of people in the stomach without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. cancer, manditis, skin infection, infection) are well reacted to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered at a moderate or inappropriate rate, they will develop from bacteria that respond well to bacteria that are very resistant to antibiotics and which are spread rapidly in non-compliant conditions.
In particular in the case of transient or persistent poor immune system functioning in patients with impaired body weight, low body weight or in patients in years, serious medical infections, such as early infection or blood vessels - sepsis may occur.
According to the superior physician of St. Jana, there is no special, similar infection in patients for daily practice.
"The infection must not be replaced by an epidemic, MRSA is not only there," Tibor Nyulasi declared, "where the presence of the origin of the disease is not tested."
It extends to antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the healing staff heals them in rubber gloves and masks and we need antibiotics for their treatment," Tibor Nyulasi said.
Patients admitted to the hospital have been pre-tested to see whether MRSA is present in their body or not, however, the infection should not always be avoided.
Sample selection is not in mode
The vast majority of MRSA infections caused by MRSA could be predicted, although the current measures and conditions in domestic hospitals are not designed to prevent the occurrence and spread of multi-resistant origins, says Karolina Böröczová.
Since this infection occurs significantly in hospitals and nursing homes, patients treated should be monitored and MRSA should be immediately isolated.
The collection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in fashion.
The role played in this is that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance this investigation.
Most of the cases are so isolated that if a patient suffers from MRSA infectious infection, the epidemiological center's observatory said.
The European Union has urgent recommendations for appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotics are targeted, or that microbiological testing should be conducted in order to mitigate the cause of resistance to medicinal products, even if this hospital is not available in all cases.
The microbiological samples are more detailed in the basic, ambulatory treatment of patients, told Karolin Börczová.
It's focused on disinfectants.
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is spread among patients most often through medical personnel.
Therefore, it plays a very important role in the arm and use of gloves and masks, although serious deficiencies occur in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted to the cape infection and infection, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients under the conditions of home patients.
However, rooms are often filled, the bed is often very close to each other, perhaps from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 metres away from themselves.
As noted by Karolina Böröczov, we may also regret that in hospitals that are in an unaccompanied material situation, there are few nurses and many patients who still have a chance of getting infection.
According to Karolin Börczov, where necessary protective measures are maintained, similar infections may be demonstrated less or may not stop further spread of the origin.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of an MRSA infection is for health insurance costs, and therefore it is being fought everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has signed an MRSA prevention programme, which reduces its emissions.
The program seems to be successful, according to the published data, the MRSA infection in England is decreasing trend.
The European Centre for the Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) organises prevention of multiresistance sources of disease (including MRSA), respectively, of hospital infections caused by these diseases, among their priorities.
The police captain who caused a fatal accident was not drunk
The official finding court in the case of Captain XXII, who caused a fatal accident, is ready.
It may be excluded from informing the speaker of the Supreme State representative of the capital of Attila Morvai on Friday after having completed the notice of this case.
The finding confirmed the outcome of the initial investigation, which already found that the former police captain had not been drinking any alcohol before he sat down as a volunteer.
The most difficult police director of the XXII police department hit the train on Tuesday in the streets of Layos Kossutha in XXII.
(Lastly, the fact that the driver has gone beyond zero, otherwise according to road traffic rules, is not a mitigating circumstance, which must also be given priority.)
After he was transferred to the hospital, the driver died.
As a result, the Chief Chief of Command withdrew from office and requested the transfer of services, according to a police report, because he was so upset.
In this regard, an investigation is carried out by the State Inspectorate of Budapest.
Attila Morva also mentioned that the former police captain had been working with state agents in the investigation.
Other EUR 400 million on infrastructure
The agreement on three credit frameworks totalling EUR 400 million in support of schools, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy in Budapest was signed on Friday by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 the Hungarian budget for the financing of projects in the field of transport and the environment implemented by the Cohesion Fund, a framework of EUR 300 million, which had already concluded a credit agreement of EUR 100 million, now under the agreement relating to the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
A credit agreement of EUR 150 million is also used to finance projects related to schools.
For these purposes, the EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary and the remaining EUR 150 million may be used later, with the extension of credit contracts.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million, which is mainly used in the Debrecen University research and development project.
There was also a word about the 4th route.
The parties agreed that, after Hungary has agreed with the EU, the financing of the metrics will return to whether and how the original contract should be amended.
According to János Verese, this can take place in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has financed in Hungary since 1990 an amount of EUR 8.4 billion in total 113 projects.
The amount of credit provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without an obligation shall be linked to EURIBOR.
Bulgaria is a real EU environment
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is overwhelming - the attention of Europe as a whole turning to a previously-mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who is still buying the most cheap yet quickly on the EU's emerging market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-in-the-first European real estate purchase goal is now Bulgaria with its cheap luxury apartments and houses on the coast.
From the top are most in the range of Bansko, Borvec, Pamproo and Vitoša, then on the sea coast, Albena, Golden sands, Sunshine beaches, old cities Sozopol and Nesebar, and still more people are looking for properties around Kavarny and Balčik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, first or later the interest of investors and central parts of the country - for example, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more interested parties are also buying around Russia’s green city.
The capital city of Sofia is also a commitment to peaceful opportunities, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best path to change into one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises and to become next to the summer and winter season for the purpose of the journey and for the next two years.
The forecast investors are already buying in large areas, for example around the Bank.
According to analysts, buyers of real estate in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyle.
Most customers come from England, but also from France, Belgium, Spain and Romania.
There are also malts and Cypriot investors here, in the Black Sea and in the laser paradises there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign buyers can divide into three groups, says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who use it buy either renovated properties at EUR 50-100 thousand or damaged old houses at EUR 5-15 thousand which then renew.
They require good access and communication opportunities, it is important for them to be close to the big city, to trade and to make a doctor’s decision.
The second category are the purchasers of chat (Bulharsko held in December among the first 10 German recreational objectives).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of raising values in the medium- or long-term horizon.
Impartiality in the main city is inevitable because the question is still stronger.
In Bulgaria, the lowest prices in the European Union are currently low, but in the last five years, 21 per cent have grown annually.
The increase in real estate prices is significantly higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and Hungarian 6%
According to the Minister of the Environment and the Water Economy of Gabor Fodora, the meeting of experts will be concluded on Tuesday, and the International Conference on Climate Mode will continue to meet ministers after the mid-term.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are talking about the Bali Roadmap, which resolves the following efforts after the period of reduction of emissions by the Kyoto Protocol, which is valid until 2012.
At this point, there is a heated debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that it is now unable to deal with the exact figures, although it is agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 per cent by 2020 in view of the 1990 situation.
Another major issue of the conference is whether the developed countries will not only contribute to the provision of both material and technical assistance to countries that are linked to it.
The agreement also resulted in grants for developing countries.
The Trust Fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by the 16-member Governing Council, most likely within the framework of the World Environment Programme (GEF) at the UN - we can read in Piac es Profit magazine.
Six per cent of Hungary
The Minister for the Environment and Water Economy, Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, is supporting the EU's efforts to play a leading role in the global climate protection effort and in helping to create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% from 1990 despite the success of the adoption of "the 2012 agreement" by 2020 and is ready to undertake up to 30% reduction if other productive areas of the world, the most prosperous countries concerned, are willing to accept responsibility and commitments in line with their options.
The Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries which joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had achieved a 5.2 per cent reduction target, with 8 per cent committed to the 15 EU Member States in those years.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% around the years 1985-87, which our authority is fully aware of. - it is recalled in a press report by the Ministry of the Environment.
It is very much about Bali, because within two years it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on long-term climate change policy, otherwise its entry into force would have been made secure until 2012. In such a case, the commitment to reduce the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately introduce a new emission reduction system, which would also indicate the need in its latest report to the UN International Scientific Committee on Climate Change - the IPCC, which is the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and an inevitable increase in earth's average temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British Army is conducting a gathering on YouTube
The British military units publish on the server for sharing video recordings from shares in Iraq and Afghanistan, which they popularize themselves.
First of all, YouTube prefers British Air Force (RAF): special units operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos from action against the Taliban since March 2006, announced by BBC.
The recordings of the miniatur camera attached to the attachment are controlled by the Air Force Commander in the area of Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are transferred to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
This form has already reached 139 sets of British air forces and has already seen more than 75 thousand people on their "channel".
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishes records of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Founding in Afghanistan
Air forces have published videos according to their original purpose for the assembly and by the Ministry of Defence, they are good to make known to the general public with the actual objective of the presence of the army abroad.
"The promotion published in this form against traditional television advertising is almost nothing," said BBC expert on defence issues Gordon Mackenzie, "but there is also a certain political message in itself, as the special form confirms the legality of military actions decided by the government."
The Americans made the game
The army is concerned that, despite carefully adjusted, censored recordings, amateur videos are also available on the server, attracting for example the death of soldiers: in a bit of covert, "official" propaganda movies, the officials are mostly talking about losses, yet there is no blood like fighting.
The Internet has recently received a lot of video from the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, which has resulted in a sharp invasion, and the British army has come to them to this day.
The Americans do a bit different - using the shooting game name America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can mostly get a faithful simulation directly into the soldiers' skin.
At the ministries, Christmas will be with tomatoes and bananas
The Ministry of Labour Monika Lamperth's work is obviously not sensitive: the place of the festival will arrange for its employees a final working meeting, which will be awarded by the year 2007.
Some ministries will celebrate with live music, while officials will enjoy the evening atmosphere of Tombola and the proverb.
The dinner, the evening atmosphere, the concerts and the Swedish table - it's so powerful.
State authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The most important ministerial holiday celebration this year is organized by the Ministry of Defence, but does not expect its employees.
The Christmas gifts will be given to children of fallen soldiers, family members currently serving in foreign missions, but they also arrange receptions for journalists.
The Resort is operating on the atmosphere at the end of the year 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFY) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GKM) will pay other resorts out of cash.
The GKM dinner is held in the centre of Yöő Háza, with a total of 4,320,000 forints and of the six hundred employees of the ministry are expected to be around three hundred and fifty guests.
The resort will be held for its celebration of Christmas traditions, but it will also come at different performances and will also solve the tomola.
The NFU continued 4,700 000 forums and held in the middle of the building of the State Justice Council (OIT) - concerts and dinners were on the program.
I'm buying a soul of millions of forints, the rest was invested on more than four of them invited.
It appears that one section of the NFU is still invited to the next Christmas celebration: it arranges the tendering company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from the Union money.
To this end, they found the building of the beautiful White House.
The MAG did not confirm this information because we were unable to arrest the person concerned.
The dress doesn't need
The OIT building not only hosted the NFU but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which replaced Vánoc on December 7th, St. Lucia.
However, he did not want the OIT to use his rooms for money.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The evening began with the Minister of Medicine, and after dinner it was possible to dance for the performance of live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] on the dances, there were no required evening clothing or clothing.
The Puritan Festival is host to health, work and local self-government.
The Ministry of Health organises a programme and celebration for employees for 400 000 Forints in its own building.
Minister of Labour Monika Lamberth's staff are not even officially invited to the evening party, although at the final working meeting.
It is estimated that 80 guests who, according to the press release, will receive only coffee and paychecks, so there will be only 350,000 for parties.
Minister for Local Self-Government Gordon Bajnai will simply join his staff in the Ministry of Local Self-Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) arranges a dinner dinner for 436 employees in its own large hall.
The party is awarded 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes receptions with Swedish tables and snacks.
From the time he is Minister János Veres, he celebrates PM Vánoce's employees in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the festival will be lacking, formality strengthens not only ministerial demonstration but also the afternoon driving time.
The Resort of Agriculture arranges 20th January annual receptions, the Ministerial Festivals are not held.
Recipes are effective in the city of Vajdahunyadvár in the City of Sacraments and according to the Ministry's communication, there are 1,000 Forints per person for a hundred guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception for which only the relevant foreign diplomats of accreditation are invited in Hungary.
These annual receptions start with short treatment of the Minister and end with a small reception.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Schools and Culture of Evening Festivals have never arranged, the Portal [origo] sent the relevant press department.
The price of the evening holidays of the living environment resort in the printing department could not be reported.
In each case, four were invited to attend the Festival at the Art Museum.
Switches to the opposite end of the stack
The Association of Committees of the Leagues, respectively, of the National Trade Councils (MOSZ), shall establish its standing committee on the coordination of the semi-unlimited rates on Friday.
The work will be suspended on Saturday, Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act.
The action will certainly result in serious disruption of transport, as rail transport is almost completely stopped and staff of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be stopped by 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League will meet together with the National Coalition Councils with details of the joint afternoon courses.
There will also be a standing committee of LIGA - MOSZ, which will coordinate the morning action.
On Saturday a protesting public meeting will take place, and from Monday morning the committee which joins the event will stop working for a period of time unencumbered if it does not reach agreement with the government.
This means that no deadline has been set for the end of the stage which will begin on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not finally adopt the Health Insurance Act, the Committees shall immediately withdraw the call to the standing committee.
However, if the rule of law is to be voted, the Standing Committee shall meet and decide on another procedure.
According to the afternoon session of Parliament, it is also possible that the health insurance law will be voted in late evenings, perhaps at night.
Due to the serious disruptions of transport in the early morning, work will be stopped on the railway, and the next day some of Budapest's wholesale transport can be stopped and more than half of Volan's companies can be stopped.
At the same time, there are many places in the country to close half of the road.
A number of committees and civil society organisations have joined the call for a standstill. The list has been kept up to date on the League's website.
Some organizations have announced a slow pace, others have announced temporary termination of work.
On the fourth afternoon, the Hungarian State Road (MÁV) and the Independent Committee of Railway Workers (VDSZZ) were unable to agree even on the services available, while at the start of the evening holidays, more people are traveling by train.
According to the standard communications, from the start of the operation to the start of 13 hours in the BKV, from 7 to 9 hours in the morning in Budapest Airport, the four-hour term is organized by the Board of Energy Workers in the LIGA, to the 2nd, respectively, the 2-8-hour suspension of work by the Committee of the Pedicators and the Democratic Committee of the Pedicators.
The Association of Hungarian Doctors will be held throughout the country, the Democratic Committee of Health and Social Affairs (EDDSZ), which belongs to the Cooperation Forum of Committees (SZEF), will hold a two-year course of investigation.
The most important of the four requirements of the League's associations is to call on the government to draft health insurance reform and to propose a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that a new method of calculating payments should be applied from the following year on a progressive basis.
Thirdly, the possibility of inclusion in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Committee of Railway Workers (VDSZZ), which falls under the League's Association of Committees, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport concerning railway services and expects another offer.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased the risk of the country
The activity of the Hungarian Guard, based on the support of Jobbik Magyarszágért in July of this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Institute of Political Capital, has now increased in several respects the political risk of Hungary and the whole area.
In the "risk alert" developed by the company, it says that in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that "in view of the lack of existing ethnic tension between the Roma and the non-Roman population of Hungary, it is possible that in a short time even violent ethnic attacks may occur".
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to lead to such action - it provides research institutes.
As he writes, all of this can be explained by one of the greatest ignorance of Hungarian political representatives: "The public debate on the Roma issue has been interrupted by public life representatives of radical and extremist political gatherings who could set up a political strategy on the Roma-Major debate."
This problem deepens, robs normal dialogue, strengthens extremism and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - the trial of the institute.
In addition, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, according to the Institute of Research, has a significant impact on domestic and foreign media "to a significant extent has shown the image of Hungary abroad, particularly with regard to faith in the stability of the country and its democratic history".
The Institute recalls: the reorganisation of Hungarian radical and ultra-rightful groups, which have been becoming increasingly publicized and véhemence since the fall of 2006, is that since 2007 several organizations have been established in Hungary, which themselves are referred to as "national households".
"The common feature of these groups is that they themselves define themselves as civil society, while openly voting - and armed - the willingness of their members to carry out their defence duties (in the case of biological disasters, attacks by the authorities, violations of order), in addition to indicating the incapacity of police, military, or state," he adds.
It further notes that this is all being done in a way that seeks to undermine the most diverse political effort to support society and the parties to civil society.
The emphasis on civility and the form of society in the case of these collections is therefore not only to avoid legal barriers to judicial registration, but it is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also an increasing risk factor in relation to neighbouring relationships.
"In recent months they show on the Hungarian Guard immediately in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, ultranationalist political representatives of some neighbouring countries, calling for the creation of the Hungarian Guard to apologize for their own anti-personnel policy.
This can all have an impact on the political stability of the region," he adds.
According to the Institute of Research, the rise of the Hungarian Guard in central and eastern Europe is not a single factor, so the political risk for the region as a whole has increased.
As it says, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in July 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the Bulgarian guards, there are massive Roman disturbances that emerged in one of the Sofia districts (Krasna Poljana).
This BNU used to build a guard with the aim of the organisation's "national home".
In recent 17 years, according to it, in Bulgaria, the "cycán terror" has been issued, but the state has remained ineffective and hostile, a reminder of the Political Capital Institute.
It adds that the initiative has raised a heated debate on the Bulgarian public.
As it goes on to say, the increase in the risk of ethnic violence signals the announcement of certain Bulgarian Roma organisations that it will create its own guard in terms of resistance.
Since the Hungarian Guard’s activities show similarities to the Bulgarian National Guard’s activities, it is not excluded that even the Hungarians of Rome are responding to a threat in a similar way by setting up their own households, we can take into account the risk of the political capital created by the institute.
Attila Juhász, director of the Institute of Political Capital, pointed out that the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, the risk analysis is issued each year and if it finds out something that might have an impact on the risk change, they inform public opinion, such as by issuing a risk warning in this case.
The holidays aren't everywhere free
In Hungary the days of freedom are precisely laid down by the law, and it has become a practice already in general that we spend working days around the holidays, which is less than expected in the next year.
In the European Union and in America, the holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and working days.
Most of the days of work are considered to be church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is free of work - on the New Year already so that people can rest after Silvester.
During the year, we have another total of eleven free holidays.
The National Festival is on 15 March, the celebration of the revolution from 1848 and 23 October, the Memorial Day of the 1956 Revolution.
On 20 August we celebrate the establishment of the State, on 1 May, on 1 and 2 November we mention dead relatives and friends.
In addition, we have the two-day festivals of the Festival of Booths, the Festival of Booths and the Festival of Booths.
Since our national, national, or religious holidays according to the calendar of Friday belong on the weekend, it has become a practice to move the working day in case we work only one day before or after the holiday.
The price for extended weekends is, however, that we stay at work and at school on Saturdays.
When we work on the day of the wedding immediately before or after the wedding, we are working, which has been managed for many years, in a special report by the Minister of Labour.
The same provision applies to all employees and their employees, public employees and public servants.
It shall also not apply to companies and institutions which are in operation without interruption or having regard to their terms of reference in working days.
This year will only change the working order by the end of the year: since 24 December, life in the country will stop because, according to traditional experience, most people between Christmas and Silvestre before "work" or use a saved permit.
In the coming year, there are now several of our holidays, depending on the weekend, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
First, the calendar changes around the Sabbath so that workers can stay home for four days.
Saturday, 26 April, will be a working day so that it can be on Friday, 2 May, on holiday.
The next move will be on Friday, 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October, the place of Friday 24.
At the end of the year, the next year will be able to run completely in the signs of the holidays, because since December 24, they will have almost everywhere nonstop holidays, although Silvestr belongs to the middle.
Six scary little ones you can get your fellows angry with
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never get, innocent lies that we've never seen before: it's all "sustains" every day at work.
The question is whether you are accustomed to these minor discomforts, or if you set up gloves and a unclear situation that may upset the others, you will avoid it seriously.
Types.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department," your colleague tells you.
That's why you're stuck in a fight?
In a better case, he apologizes and tries to make it happen, if necessary calls for a marketing division and says he forgot to submit (this is a less common solution).
Most often the thing is solved once I'm sorry.
Before there is an apology, it is good to think about what you might be able to prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments, and try carefully to do so.
You're borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing more unpleasant than getting on for some writing, office needs or your phone, and they're not there.
You remember you put yourself on the dryer table yesterday, but it's gone by the morning?
Or did you find your money on the table of some of your colleagues that you thought was lost?
Don't take anything from your fellows without permission, otherwise they'll have the right to get involved in things.
Don't take it out of the office of a furniture or a nice paper because it may be uncomfortable when they come to you early and you'll need it right away.
Drunky about the private lives of fellows?
There's no good way to stop the spread of the knots.
Who, who, what did he do with?
Where and why?
And do not burden any soul with more than it can bear.
If any of them were to share their secrets with you, do not abuse their trust!
Lock down what you have heard, and do not check with your colleagues in his absence, or when others know about it.
You're reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and call your head back with a severe headache, because it's not good for you, or you say you'd rather rest today, think that your work, non-responsive tasks and work that have a certain term will have to be done for you by someone else.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know beforehand that the second day you don't go to work or that something can happen because you have to stay home, report that your colleagues and leaders are not confronted with your absence until the second day.
Use, neglect, phone
Did you get involved in a job where you're not going to get rid of your partner's absence?
You didn't want to be a witness to a phone call that would be better off not even to hear?
Do not abandon your employees by using them, by singing, by speaking aloud (to them above their heads), by knocking, by standing silence, by loudness of mind.
All of this can be ugly even when they are not banned from some project ( writing, planning, organization).
Are you accusing me of being wrong?
If there is no time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame yourself for forgetting another!
Don't call on any chaos in the office and beat up colleagues!
Take it if you've missed and someone paid for it, and make an appointment!
Ask yourself how you can put things in order, make trouble!
Do you feel too much like home in the office?
Heats and shoes: comfortable clothes at home, and it's not going to the office!
Don't wear clothes for free time, even if it allows your profession!
Don't be rude, visit your colleagues even by coming to the office in regular shifts - and if that's what your profession requires, it's nice and elegant!
When a person wants to make a statement, he stops being interested
A walk in the ordinary early arrest.
The radio is called a special melody: the sound is echoed to which electronic effects are attached.
I'm adding a vote.
The music changes the pace and adds the bass to the previous tones and then joins the women's congregation as a real clone.
At the mr2 station, there's a band of Zagar called Wings of Love.
Our home music life has not been up to us for a long time with a quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, however, the arrest seems quite different because you're just listening to the new Zagar album.
Yonderboie's appearance, a few new and interesting productions coming from the home digital subterranean subterranean, the overall picture of a slight change, and even though it's back in the garage rock mode with its milking into the guitar, the home electropop shows that it's something new under the sun.
Balázs Zzorer started in Friday and he also played in Yonderbo's chapel, when he finally - probably because two duchesss don't get into one card - he's gone his own way.
With its project (Zagar) and music that combines the elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pops, however, he started to lose when he was invited to compose soundtracks (e.g.
"Szezon" film by Ference Töröka.
Its formation, which started in smaller clubs, became known to a wider audience after the wan2 magazine organized their first album from 2002 among the fifty most important domestic records and declared Zagar in Yonderboie company as the only domestic development entities that could be sold on the West.
Zagar and his hat are no doubt "in the course," although no one would have asked them if they were satisfied with this beauty.
Kappel reacted as he did: made a new, better album.
The album now published named Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open up new roads, although the name itself is trying to create a concordance with the early years of Pentecost.
It's all about one version from the warehouse of the older chapel of Baláz Zzager.
Reference to the erectile, flight would be on site, but by the etheric taste of this song now appeared - according to the spirit, the trend of time - more vocal guitars, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who is currently working in England with The Puzzle group, presented the song at the top of the table in the Millenáris park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Petófi, playing the last time from the morning to the evening of popular music, we started to admire a wide range of music recordings of Wings of Love, composed with six domestic singers.
So it's all right.
Portal vvg.hu told Balázse Zzager.
hvg.hu: In relation to this new hit, the question is, how long does what you're playing remain?
Ballázs Zzóser: The definition of circuit music doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two different boxes of easy music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything and it can just happen because of the sale that makes it commercial.
However, even a good deal of money can change from honest internal needs.
In this spirit it also works, regardless of language or national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the opening of a Hungarian and foreign audience against your music?
B. Zs.: In a foreign country, especially from us to the west, the light music has greater tradition.
There's not only teenagers and people in their 20s, but also older ones.
Many more follow the changes of easy music around them because they also consider it to be part of modern culture.
hvg.hu: What is the public's role in your work?
Does it matter to you who, where and how many of your music is listening?
B.Z.: Of course it's good to feel that our concerts are going as far as more people are concerned.
But we never made music for the market.
We don't have music for a purpose, but for what reason.
The role of the audience can be more focused on concerts where each other's influence is already at work, but it is only hidden in unsatisfied changes at the moment.
However, I noticed that if a person wants to make public statements, he's stopped being interested.
hvg.hu: How much do you want to follow Yonderboie's example?
He's working alone and he's building his career better than we've ever been to the west.
B.Z.: We are not really going his way, regardless of how our music is sometimes trying to be explained.
We're rather team players who rely on another's musical presence and let her develop.
At first, of course, it was not possible to avoid comparing our work with Yonderboie's records, since several of us were separated from his hat and came out of another way.
hvg.hu: In the warm station mr2 Petófi the Wings of Love was first delivered.
Many heard the name Zagar first in connection with this warehouse.
The most popular style you've ever opened up with a wider variety?
B.Z.: We weren't planning on writing a hit that we'd sell.
It's more about that song.
We thought of it as the final album we tried to release here the previous sound system and more complex themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose these six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Z.: The exhibition was designed to create such a history of the congregation.
Then came the idea of setting up this congregation from a soloist home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-part congregation - then Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judy Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enicő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then turned to Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: That's exactly how you thought the song was, or did the girls make something about it?
B.Z.: The record was already in the instrument version when the material was found on the table, we said that there would be something else needed for it.
Following the accords, he called for a party to join him.
That night, I sang on him a song that the girls later learned.
The whole thing came out almost first and really spontaneous.
I remember how it got back, but obviously Divy needed it.
With my voice it wouldn't work this energy.
hvg.hu: As on the board, at the concert it seemed that the girls were in the background.
They don't have one (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own roles, they sing together and they're not more vocal than music, so the song just doesn't approve of their songs.
They also stood in the backyard.
I mean, is that so?
B.Z.: What was behind was just because of technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to share the solo role is logical.
And this is about forgetting some of our egos, where they belong, and leaving only those wings, loving behavior.
I was hoping that this euphoric attitude that we felt when this song was born would also be felt by others.
hvg.hu: What was the most work with?
B.Z.: During the composition of the song even with one, the toughest cuts came out even more when moving.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play at the concert hall, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work grooves long, then all the pretty little he found his place like in some store.
hvg.hu: What new board is your favorite?
B.Z.: This is always changed by the concert even though I've already released the board.
Now it's a Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth a Never The Same.
A credit card broker risked billions of dollars from a minority
A real ex-fraggerate.
This is how Jeroma Kerviela, a French bank manager of the Société Generale, owner of the Turkish Commercial Bank, is named.
She came because of him, but she didn't have five billion euros.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to get along with his colleagues and was certainly not able to.
Unlike all the big banks, there was a crisis in the U.S. mortgage market.
"It's spiritually weak," shouted his superiors, who sent the police to him.
However, as a result of Kerviel's statement by the French media, such as the daily Le Monde, he was the man who at the end of the year had earned a profit of EUR 1.6 billion.
The crisis isn't just in America.
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in his statement.
In the summer, he was given half a billion euros for the American crisis.
The opportunity has already been felt by the beginning of the year.
In fact, reports began to show that so-called sub-prime mortgages, given to low-cost clients or those who had problems with payment in the past, will have problems.
The impact on the entire economy of this crisis was not to be seen.
He didn't believe it and he was right.
By the end of the year, his profit had reached 1.6 billion euros.
"Now that I've made the first half billion, I didn't know how to make it known," Kerviel admits and adds that he's definitely left nothing for himself.
In the whole hearing, he admits that he lied to us so that he didn't get caught up in it.
He was even able to get rid of his boss, even when he started to take an interest in his business with Eurex.
Risk was gain
He was afraid he'd come to him?
Probably not.
"I thought that just the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would calm it down."
Where did he want to risk so much?
He had to work on his position gradually.
He arrived at the Society General in 2000 shortly after he graduated from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $11,000.
Two years later he was already a broker assistant, and in 2005 he became a private broker with an annual salary of $90 000.
Yet he knew he would never do as much as the rest.
"Now at my first conversation in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
Because of my education and also because of professional and personal development," Kerviel described to researchers.
But soon after the move, the first big success came.
Thanks to Allianz's action, during the bombings in London, he was still on the decline of the title of half a billion euros.
And it was a relief mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you do it, we'll leave you.
"It's like snowball," he said to the police.
But the bosses knew if they were breathing.
"As long as I made money, my eyes were closed."
And then the morning came at the beginning of this year.
He lost billions of hours in one day.
He wanted to cool it down in half a week and a half.
When he came to work on Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And the bank announced a few days later that it was five billion euros for him.
And how did they get on him?
I became a suspect because of my permission.
"I've only chosen four days in a year.
A broker who doesn't have a license is a broker who doesn't want anyone to watch his records," Kerviel shut down.
Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Yesterday, the Ministers of the Czech Government signed all nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can receive EUR 14 billion in the coming years (about EUR 365 billion).
The total amount of the total amount that can be obtained by the Czech Republic from Brussels from 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion koruna will come from seven operational programmes into the regions.
Czech companies will be able to get about 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation Programme.
The most money up to 150 billion is going to go to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the funds available to the CR.
This money is the maximum budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will be managed next year with a share of $90.8 billion.
The Communication and Innovation Programme shall serve businesses and companies to acquire resources for innovation.
Firms should receive funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
In the EU funds collection of money, the EU's contribution to the new host countries is at least successful.
Twenty-year sentence for the representative of Nicaragua confirmed the court
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan court confirmed the twenty-year sentence for former President Arnold Germany, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial subsidization of $100 million (less than 1.8 billion dollars).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in his home prison for his arrest near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
If the head of this Central American state sometimes comes back after the network from 1997 to 2002, it is not clear by the AP agency at this time.
According to the Court of Appeal, Ilean Pérez will now be dependent on prison officials whether they allow Germany to continue his punishment at home or go to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed Germany that he regularly transferred government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were active and the account belonged in fact to his relatives and the closest employees.
Some of these money then ended up in the fund that Germany based on the financing of its election campaign in 2001.
That's how we've accepted the budget.
That's right.
The State budget was adopted.
What is this extraordinary budget?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by the majority of coalitions without the support of the opposition.
This year, Lonni was still in favour of ČSSD because he was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not allow his rejection.
Unlike the Russian debate before the vote on mistrust, the government has done nothing dramatic this time.
This post-sanctuary is traditionally viewed, although the most influential, law has been approved in silence.
It's a certain paradox.
Each government starts and ends at individual chapters and budgets whether it likes or doesn't like someone.
The budget is an essential part of policy, but it is hidden from powerful opposition governments.
That's a little more grateful, and that's why he gets a lot more attention in the media.
Policy issues are far more interesting to the public than hard numbers.
The State budgets in the previous social democratic governments suffered by three non-spirits which were not able to resolve immediately in 2008:
The first of these is a high part of the law of mandatory, so-called administrative expenses, which are not only pensions but also social doses that have been approved by the silent "coalie" of the ČSSD and KSCHM in the past year before the elections.
The other is the lack of management as a consequence of the failure of the first spirit.
The third limit is public finances deficits, i.e. urban and urban budget deficits.
However, this greatest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
He's public and relatively controlled.
However, the time bomb is a city and city budget deficit.
Many people are concerned that, in addition to the money from taxes, payments and loans from the bank, they have received additional investment resources, often openly issued bonds that they have not duly owed to their consultants.
In the past years, they have been paid these debts by the mass sale of energy and other divorce networks that have received from the state of privatization.
They don't have this source anymore.
If we follow only official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going on for several years, just like the rest of the world, a growing phase that continues to collapse ČSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to manage public finances.
Instead, the state was increasingly indebted.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, dominated much more rational than our republic.
It's a huge shame that falls mainly on the previous government.
We belong to countries that are at least threatened by poverty at the global level.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes that, unfortunately, in recent years have been quite overhauled into giant dimensions.
Although it has been possible to cancel some of the unreasonably populistic expenditure that has been approved this year before elections, so that in the near future it will not be able to move the limit of income to pension and pension reform, then it will actually end any policy in this country and it will only govern anyone who will.
A little overdue can be said to become officials, mechanically disbursing most of the money paid for pensions and social contributions from government policies.
The annual budget cannot therefore be revolutionary, but it can only stop the issue of normal expenditure by mandate.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be extremely significant if previous governments had not managed over the past ten years.
If we do not really want the government to become only officials, then we need to be patient and reach this very strong coalition government, which knows that the state can only issue as much as it can on taxes and payments as it can afford to be comfortable in the preparation of other reform laws.
Only the progressive achievement of the balance-of-state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The United States Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the financial markets jointly.
The exchange market will thus reach more than a hundred billion dollars through auction.
In these auction banks, it costs the rate of money they are willing to borrow.
For example, the U.S. Fed has sent to the auction of $40 billion and the other four will then access the European and Swiss central bank.
This is the first time that the central banks of the individual states have agreed on such a coordinated approach to preventing or reducing the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step will solve the biggest economic problems, so growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow," Bernard Baumohl wrote in his report to customers from the Economic Outlook Group.
"Coordinated central banks' actions have reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65 per cent to 50%," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already come to $60 billion for unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect another billion losses.
"Central banks must be really afraid of what may yet follow when they decide for this procedure," ABN's main economist Amro Kieran Davies said.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
The central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficulty access to loans, they will be more likely to lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the US economy into recession with potential impacts on the economic growth of the world.
The central banks decided after which it was not able to reduce the LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to borrow money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about each other's borrowing money, although the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had reduced their rate rates several times.
"It will have the same effect as another drop in level rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the steps of central banks will contribute to the introduction of a crisis, because it does not solve the fundamental problem, which is a market for real estate in the United States.
Klaus: Ecological Debates are incredible
Global climate change is the most harmful to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again expressed his concern about global warming.
The crisis is now at the conclusion of the UN International Conference on Climate Change on Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Modra, never a green planet, he pointed out that ecological debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the conference structure which creates a wonderful mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric it conducts and the reality.
"The debate is completely unstructured there, it is just a flash of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
In presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that its theme is very important to him and that is why he is so committed to them.
He also found comfort in the fact that the book appears in the German translation, because, as he said, "I sometimes only meet with the cartoons of my views."
So now the interested people can read his unexplained existence.
Klaus reminded me that the lake is not a climateist, but according to his opinion, it has enough assumptions to write such books.
However, it is academia capable of monitoring and considering the professional union, has experience with statistics and is also a national economy.
In the main conclusion of the book, he pointed out that climate changes are constantly changing and that it is therefore normal for all scientists to consider planet Earth to be inconsistencies, that the consequences of these changes are not too large and are therefore not a threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are essential, ineffective and unfriendly.
In addition, as a person with experience with totality, he is considered to be a hostile invasion of unconfirmed views, which he feels as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He explained again on questions that it is not against "a reasonable protection of the environment but against military environmentalism which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their use".
Klaus in Vienna spoke on the same subject two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver couldn't change 600 thousand people.
Six hundred thousand drivers lost their duration and could not change the old driving licence whose validity would extend by the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for an exchange so that their authorities can still present a new document by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year, the drivers' statistics will be published on the road without payment.
According to the authorities, they did not exchange evidence mainly for those who no longer want to run.
While the city reports a sudden decline in the interest of the driver's exchange, the authorities in the metro have grown in demand and interest in the exchange of evidence has grown this week.
The Magistrate spends about 2,000 customers a day.
In front there's half an hour of noise waiting.
In Prague the driving licence has not yet been exchanged for a total of 150,000 drivers.
The presentation of a new trial shall take twenty days.
But it's possible to request a release within a short period of five days.
In such a case, however, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Engineers who are required to exchange the test shall not reach the end of the year and shall be on the road without a driver's license shall be subject to a cold risk.
The prosecutor will pay no more than two thousand crowns.
But the police can also solve the crime.
In the case of an infringement, the account shall be paid to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, he could have received an account from the office and from a person who would never go anywhere.
He could probably have paid $30,000.
The Ministry previously called on the authorities to be peaceful and to obtain the highest thousands of bribes.
According to the Ministry of Transport, Karl Hanzelky's tenets are not threatening anyone.
The guide is based on the evidence in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not a civil record that every human being must have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should issue a driver's license.
It shall be sufficient to carry it or to send a recommendation to the relevant general authority.
At the end of the year, evidence issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be paid.
However, motorists must gradually exchange other types of driving evidence.
From 1994 to 2000, people have more than three years to change.
The validity of the evidence issued between 2001 and 2004 shall end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelky, it's about 2.6 million more evidence.
The court reduced the fines of detectives associated with Berdyche
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konerík, who are accused of having a criminal relationship with the gang of David Berdycha, will be in prison for thirty and ten years.
With definitive jurisdiction, the Prague Supreme Court decided to reduce the penalties so imposed on them once a year and two years later.
It initially threatened the detectives of the Prague Committee for the fight against organised crime for 14 and 12 years.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, it can only be granted to the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also in this case indicted, but he's waiting for the first court verdict.
In other processes, however, he has already been subjected to 16 years of imprisonment.
He can't get more.
In January, the national court recognized, in particular, the participation of 19 innocent victims, and today the Supreme Court ruled on 16 of them.
Most of the accused complained since the start of the investigation with regard to the case under construction.
According to the Central Senate, police officers, after an agreement with Berdyche, provided information to criminals from police sources, covered a number of minor infringements and helped gang members to avoid criminal liability.
Gang gave up 30 percent for Opava and Connor.
The complaint concerns the criminal activity of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, the theft, which many victims have suffered from serious health concerns, but also the abuse of public power and illegal weapons.
During home visits, the police found illegally held guns, shots with steel core, laser detector or autogun.
Gang was charged with ten million crowns.
In addition to the lack of twenty men in this process, the courts have already found themselves guilty of other beatings by Berdych and a number of others.
Other men from the area of Berdycha still speak before the court in another process, some of the causes have not yet been accepted before the court.
The main calculation has already been avoided by Tomáši Pototo and Maroshi Šulej, who are in the Irish relationship, where they are waiting for a definitive decision on their issue of accession to the Czech Republic.
Account for the exchange of children: 12 million
In exchange for children in the family, the lawyer wants the injured family Igor Veleba after the emergency hospital to be injured by 12 million korunas, plus court charges.
For each mother by three million, for fathers by two million and for children by one million.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of Andrej Hospital has therefore not agreed in principle with Veleby's proposal.
"We reject such a requirement, it is very high," said Dosal after today's meeting.
"But in order for us to take an opinion on the opposition, we need a prominent trial that the opposition has left to develop.
We'll find out if he's even worth telling.
But we keep in mind that this will be in statistics for everyone," pointed Dostal.
According to him, the amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the family case, Jablon's family wanted every month when she didn't raise her biological daughter, millions of crowns.
Velebov served as the basis for a consultation on the harmful findings he had developed at the Praze-Motole Faculty.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, children suffered mental anguish and stress in different degrees and depth.
Men were better able to cope with stressful situations, even when they had to contend with claims that replacements of newborns had not been prevented.
Women are up again compared with the current trauma and what's happening right now, the contents of Veleb.
Veronica and Nicole were exchanged by the medical sisters in the Nebula family on 9 December.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermákový to Pribyslavic and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslav Trojan to Jablonov.
Heytman Hüstočin Milos He spent the last October of every family 100,000 korunas in compensation for the expenses caused by their lack of the emergency hospital that the country is planning.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are covered by the law on liability for damage.
In the event of a mistake, they must be transferred to the reserve fund, and they can only ask for the help of the disputer.
The courts have already acknowledged relatively low damage to humans, the sum is calculated according to the table in a number of statistics, except for millions of crowns.
Polivka came about the kingdom of the Valais
The pain of Polívka lost its dispute about the sign of the Valais kingdom.
According to the judgment of the Austrian National Court of First Instance, he first used the name of the king of the vald, but the project was building a long-term work team around Tomáše Harabiš, who worked with the emperor.
The police didn't take part in the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and the client is calling.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are paralysing on the popularity of Bolka Polívky," the lawyer said after the Polívk process.
According to him, in the words of the kingdom of the Valais, everyone will have a real priest and comet.
The same is true of Harabish.
"It's almost a decade's work for us.
Money-saving and planning action," he said.
He says there's a lot of money.
"After years they realized that the project was successful and could have something from it.
They want to ban our work," he added.
Liquefied business
According to the court, the king of the vald first used Polívka in his television show.
In 1993 she was crowned by Hercules Radoslav Brzobothý.
However, this did not depend on the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came up with the idea of producing whale passports.
The original resilitary action included trade and lucrative business activity, which Harabiš then referred to the establishment of the company of the Valašká kingdom.
In 1997, Polívka agreed with the mention of his name and signature in the passports and even offered to their owners the discounts when visiting his farms and the theatres.
Who's sitting on the throne?
The Court also stated today that Harabish had only used the holo-goal idea that Polivka published in the case of his business plan.
"Popularita Boleslava Polívky of the Valais kingdom project must have helped," the judge said.
She added, however, that her soul was Harabish and his team devoted to him.
The cooperation of the disbursed parties today continued until 2000, when Harabish organized an official corunization for Polívka in Vsetina.
Since then, however, there have been disputes between Polívka and Harabish that have raised the "King of Boleslav I."
The king’s role in the kingdom was then played by the singer Jarmila Šulák as the queen’s mother at the foot of Harabish.
Then, in 2002, Polívka appealed to Harabiša and his company, which the court refused today.
Clearly, it could lead to Harabish's sworn curse on the throne and half the princess.
He's supposed to be coming out of the new king.
The details and the term he didn't want to produce yet.
"We don't want to make anything.
It should be something like a king's ride to Slovakia.
The King should be loved for some time.
And Mr. Polívka can log in quietly," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeoto 207 SW 1.6 VTi: cross-sectional
In fact, I've never been too hard on Peugeot 206.
His driving properties were not very much, the quality of cutting, handling and also the product would be marked slightly below average.
But there's now Peugeot 207, and that's much better.
And the van called SW is still about the shirt and I don't need to think about it better.
When I was testing the classic hackback Peugeot 207, I complained for example on the back seat area.
It's already a problem here, because the van car cart means that they won't suffer in this direction for two and a half feet long.
World Year
I'm going through the interior very quickly so I can't get back.
It's all about the design that I've been given, where I've got the only thing I've got to do with the poor middle tunnel.
Here I would appreciate something more designer invention when the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and they're there when we can complain about short seats or vice versa.
Side behaviour has also significantly improved against model 206.
As far as the space is concerned, it's still here to feel an increase in the size of the cartserie.
There's already a lack of space on your head in the van.
Encryption
It's the main driver of this car, so he's his fiancée.
I have to evaluate this as very well accessible (and also thanks to the closing window) and as a perfectly consistent one.
The sound seats are equipped with durable tires, which are an ideal compromise.
It doesn't stop, it can slow down and it keeps more difficult objects.
But let's get together on both sides.
This is in line with the table in the basic arrangement 428 l, which is more than the average value against competition.
However, not against the most selling vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic - injury to Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with a new generation of youth production, then we will find that Peugeot is left with a very famous 52 litres.
This value is critical to be allowed to go to a foreign country or when placing a cat.
But if I have to breathe positive, then I still need to mention the exact same base after the second line or very low pressure.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested vehicle was equipped with a rear four-wheel drive of 1.6 l with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, she should look like a six-year-old who's driving a family hackback.
He's quiet, he's got a little consumption, and he's got a drink.
If I compare her to a period of harm that's mildly going on, like she's supposed to have a hard drive to the elevator, then I can only be overcome by it.
The price of the offer
The price of the train is not human.
However, we have to remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a space interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the vehicle is 329 900 Kč.
Our farm is 410 900 Kč, which is quite enough.
Tested premium equipment then comes equipment for another 80,000 Kč proposal.
So we still had main airbags, automatic air-conditioning, automatic fire extinguishers, electrical control of the back windows...
Just the car is all over 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but calculate the extra equipment at Fabie and you'll get to a very similar number.
So he doesn't have to make a decision about the sign.
The integration of Slovenian pupils into British schools is not possible
In British schools, children from Eastern Europe are being raised, which causes local residents to be concerned about further development of local schools.
Eastern European integration is currently being attacked by a number of obstacles.
British schools even record cases when disputes between immigrants and children of indigenous peoples persist in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools well illustrates the case in northern Kent where disputes between local residents and Slovenian immigrants begin.
Hobbies, scars and cracks between the jaws have also been transferred to relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham, the police kept a Slovenian woman who had been riding a railing train for a decade.
The prosecution defends that the boy insulted her with racist charges.
The police had to arrest two young women after an attack on a Slovenian passenger.
The girls of men probably attended racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy jumped on a bus stop and started swimming on us.
When I told him to leave it, he leaned on us apples and raisins and then left his ass," she described another unpleasant opportunity for The Times' mother of Slovenian jokes.
The difficulties are on both sides.
One of the local residents even marked disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe for the fight against survival.
The above cases show that the atmosphere at British schools between local and immigrants is beginning to get drunk.
In Britain, there are 70 thousand Slovaks who have intended to work here.
Then there are 30 thousand Slovenian pupils visiting British schools.
Caribbean island of the largest island in the world
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from yourself, you can do it if you choose the right way.
Gold and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm as a fisherman.
Palmy and all including with cleaners who offer on the beach pizza, ice cream and heavy cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf course.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you will find it in a full and even richer account.
Only on one island, but you will find more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antil.
For the Spaniards, Cuba was the forest of their acquisition of America.
Columbus marked it for the most beautiful place that people's eyes have ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and a warehouse of warehouses that Spanish people in America had acquired and transported to Europe.
And then the American era came.
Hotel National grew up at the same end of the 20th year.
He allowed him to be one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was in the U.S. crime (particularly ban), was welcomed and supported by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were me.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high - rise houses were built, and after extensive bullfights, a car that belonged to the cultural symbols of the last 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a seat in San Francisco de Paula, a cousin from Havana, and in Cojmar he had his jacket.
On the walls of the Bodeguity del Medio they left their signatures of the stars of the business and politics across America.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls in the Havana Bodeguita.
At the bar of the precious national hotel, you'll be given a cocktail according to your wish.
And this 50-year-old cult car is still going after Havana, because the imported jellyfish and bats in this salted and wet air have long gone by.
Being Havana, especially its oldest part, is a significant drawback, although there are not as beautiful colonial monuments around it as there is right there.
Other places are also transformed into beauty, perhaps Trinidad.
In view of the fact that travel is bringing so much money, its development is green.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varaderu, the province of Holguín and islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another luxury that is unique in the world and is especially appreciated by trainers.
Three thirds of the scattered plantations were added to sugarcane after the narrow wheels of steam and engine wheels.
Their car park has not been restored for decades, so they are there to see functioning machines whose varieties are still only in museums.
Where are you going?
This most famous place of most Cuban visitors is gone.
And so about Varader, or about Havana, it doesn't have to be too detailed.
Just remember that in the Hemingway settlement mentioned earlier, there is a museum and whoever likes this writer should not allow his visit.
Vignales Valley One of the smallest bays of Cuba is Vignales on the west side of the island.
The bitter plant grows from the steamy floor.
Powers, steaming harmony and rocks are soaking out of the bottom of the valley, and in their condition the land is hit by the south, thanks to which the air scale is also covered by sharp sand dunes.
The street is the place where the best Cuban tobacco can be found.
With its final image you can meet if you visit any of the Havan factories for the production of dolls.
Maybe someone's going to come up with some interesting idea about the Chilean part of Major Zeman.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonization of the islands.
His glory and wealth brought him trade with children and sugar.
Wealth turned into the beauty and splendor of a small city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by later French legislators, has not changed in almost four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray, is so remote that in the last 50's there was no road that would be connected to the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay away.
It wasn't there, and that's why it didn't work out, everyone was glad he had a roof over his head.
If you have more time on Trinidad than one afternoon, then you should also look at the interesting place in the vicinity, such as the beach Playa Ancón, or the valley of the Sugars.
The evening is to go to Casa de la Música, which lives after the sowing and music in it runs over the morning.
Baracoa
The town on the very east coast of Cuba is identified by some as the fastest on the island.
The doseist's view is already affecting the road itself.
The two roads that lead from Guantanam must pass through the high mountains and through the nature of which human activity is almost unknown.
Cuba's eastern island has been registered by UNESCO through a dark and undamaged nature on the World Heritage List.
They're doing the best chocolate in the church, they've got Columbus cross (in fact it came up about a hundred years after Columbus' swimming) and from the hills where they stand some garden and El Castillo Hotel today, it's seen several table mountains, of which the most famous is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, showers, Sierra Maestre, about the Fifth Dog and Island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropical Cabaret, about the holy Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, the African religions that identify the descendants of some of the children, there would be many pages to describe.
But, as it is rightly said, it's better to see it once.
The allies in Afghanistan are passive, strong Americans
Few soldiers and lack of equipment are affected by the United States of America's mission process in Afghanistan.
According to NATO Defence Minister Robert Gates, a specific plan should be planned for the next year.
The mission in Afghanistan does not try according to the image, the representatives of the countries in the Scottish Edinburgh, which have units in the southern part of the country, agreed.
According to the growing opposition from the Taliban, today eight participating states are also discussing further alliance plans and coordination.
While the United States this week, through Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO units called for greater activity, Great Britain sees a priority in strengthening the authorities of the Afghan government and strengthening development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is massive, but military force can only be a part of the solution.
This is another way for citizens to start further economic and security development on their own," British Defence Minister Des Browne said.
Twenty-nine percent
The activity of Afghan rebels is according to the U.S. Army data for the last five years.
The number of violent acts rose by 27 per cent last year, in the southern province of Helmand even by 60 per cent.
NATO has 40 thousand troops in Afghanistan, from which four quarters in the south.
According to the United States, however, the associations reached the same limit in the organisation and equipment.
They specifically require other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the specific objectives for the next time and how to achieve them," said Gates.
In a similar way today, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke.
"I am not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about nine percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's a little," said the Reuters De Hoop agency at the end of class discussions with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive?
Among the countries involved in the past few months, there are also discussions on whether all associations are leading to the maximum level in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticised for passports.
"The Germans have relatively numerous representations in Afghanistan.
But they are found in areas where there are at least violence and war strikes on them are not as high as we are in the south and east parts of the country," Gates said.
This week, the British bulvarian Sun has marked German soldiers for Lenochy.
"The Afghan fighters are fired: the Germans are playing while our hosts are fighting," Sun wrote in a material, accompanied by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German picture moved into the opposition and drew up a picture of the British unit at the bandby game in southern Afghanistan.
State debt is expected to fall to the billion in 2009
Every Czech country owes more than 44,000 crowns.
The total debt is going to end at 842.7 billion crowns.
The government planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, the Ministry has reduced its plan to EUR 152.8 billion through better development of the government budget.
The State debt of the Czech Republic ended at 842.7 billion koruna.
In nine months of this year, it has risen to $40.2 billion.
Since June, he's been down by $13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance has thus confirmed its data on State debt since the beginning of October.
Every Czech is worth more than 44,000 crowns.
For the entire length of the year, he owed more than 111 billion dollars.
"In the meantime it seems that due to the lower deficit for the next year, we could overcome the billions of crowns by 2009.
The next year it would take a long time to move between 900 billion and billions of crowns," he said to the iHNed.cz server analytic Patricia Finance David Marek.
Similarly, the analyst Next Finance Vladimir Pikora says: "To exceed one billion we could get through 2009.
When it will depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it was shown that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to do more than that, it could be assumed in 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Straight-line depreciation [l]
The State debt creates central government debt and results in, in particular, the accumulation of State budget deficits.
The State debt shall be financed by subcontractors, state debt, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the state has risen by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion dollars a year.
This year's foreign debt grew by 1.7 billion koruna to 123.3 billion koruna.
The so-called commercial State debt at the end of September reached 803.3 billion kroner and since June it has been worth 13.7 billion kroner.
The average State debt was increased by 6.5 years.
"The total debt for the first to third quarter increased by 13 per cent, which is really very much on how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly in debt accounts where 20 per cent is growing.
It's bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that it's going to deal with what it's going to do when there's a pension reform here," Piko said.
Better than expected
The 2007 State debt financing and management strategy shows that the government has planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, the Ministry has reduced its plan to EUR 152.8 billion through better development of the government budget.
The amount is mainly due to the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach 76 billion kroner instead of the projected 91.3 billion kroner.
This is the planned maximum resource for the Czech Consolidation Agency of 13.3 billion koruna, the ten-billion reserve for the payment of payments, the financing of State debt for 43 billion korunas and the payment of loans from the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion koruna.
A woman is to be brought to court today in the Charter because she gave the name of the floating bear.
On Thursday evening, a British teacher in Sudan who was sentenced to the fifteenth term of imprisonment was sentenced to a four-day term by a court of law.
The British was accused of allowing six to seven thousand years of demands to give the liquid bear the name of Mohamed despite the fact that any vision of the prophet is forbidden to Islam.
She's been severely punished by the bull.
This four-year-old British teacher, who was attending the Unity High School in the Sudan Charter, was arrested on Sunday at home and charged with violations of Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, after several complaints were made by the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story begins in fact in the month of September when the student concerned asks for his six to seven-year-old request to choose a name for the third wing bear.
"Out of the mouth of children, eight names are named, including Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed," reports school director Robert Boulos.
After voting in class, 20 of the 23 children finally choose as the most popular name Mohamed.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of a Muslim prophet, but in particular it is a very widespread Christian name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a photograph of the bear, which was presented in the book "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself had no label with that name, but the problem is in the prophet’s own vision considered to be a violation of Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues Gillian Gibbons, who teaches in the same school in Sudan, explained that she knows her well and that she would never do anything that would be offensive to any religious faith: "I only regret that she asked the children to vote for some name," he says only about "innocent suspicion".
Such a view is shared by many pupils of teachers who describe it as "pay attention to their needs" and add that "never in class is talking about religion".
Note that the Christian name Mohamed is also the second most frequently named Christian name in Great Britain, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This Christian name is often chosen by Muslim families as a way of teaching the prophet (which is often done for the first time).
What, though, are the rules regarding the use of this Christian name?
Is it possible, for example, to give them toys?
Of course it's a question of interpretation.
During the last round of this merger in Vienna, they did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
I finally failed.
The Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians ended in mid-morning in the 6th and the last round of talks in Bangkok, without having been able to change their views on the future status of this separatist province.
"It is politically appropriate that both parties were not able to reach the status agreement," said European co-rapporteur Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
His American opponent, Frank Wisner, pointed out that peace in the area is "in the garden" and called on Bälehrad and Pristina to maintain peace and to be ready for dialogue after the meeting.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we enter the next period," he added, "it is obvious that the situation is tense."
The settlement shall end on 10 December.
Troikas, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will be finalised in Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province where 90 per cent of the Albanian-speaking population is created could be shown in a clearer light by 10 December when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian counterpart Alexander Bocan-Charčenko are to reject their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, not far from Vienna, represent six and at the same time the last round of mergers since the UN, in July of this year, Trojk believed in a new merger.
The US and Europeans are counting on the end of the debate on 10 December.
The Russians who had previously blocked Kosovo's independence assignment in the UN Security Council, however, insist on continuing the negotiations even after this deadline.
"Russia has been and remains forced to resolve the common, compromise solution," Bocan-Charčenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of management of the international community, the West considers Kosovo's independence under the EU's sole discretion.
Pristina declares that in the event that the Security Council does not decide on its benefits, it is prepared to declare its independence unilaterally.
Whitehead takes on extended autonomy.
"I'm sorry we haven't reached any agreement," announced Kosovo's self-government President Fatmir Sejdiu in a research hotel where he spent this last chance on Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former rebel leader of the Kosovo Albanians and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
He added, however, that the autonomy plan presented by Bälehrad "is the past which led to killings and deportations".
"Dominic effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic is of the opinion that the compromise continues to be taken into account and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of any unilaterally declared independence of the province.
In particular, Belarus fears "home effect" in the area which is still unstable as a result of the war on independence in the 1990s.
"But for Serbia it doesn't mean it," he said, "that compromise is impossible."
In the Serbian delegation's next day, it was essential that all decisions be exclusively made by the Security Council in which its Russian Union has the right to a covenant.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have its last word"
"The only solution that comes from the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"This meeting lasted two years.
It must end as it began: under the Security Council."
Journalists Fatmir Sedji replied that "the last word on status will have a Kosovo Parliament" and added that if a unilateral declaration of independence from Albanian-speaking citizens would be made "after agreement" with the West.
Bush appealed to the Israelis and the Palestinians
At the beginning of an international peace conference in Annapolis in Maryland released from his support, American President George Bush announced that Israel and Palestine finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He explained that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed to an immediate start of negotiations with the intention of always resolving the ongoing conflict between the two nations for 60 years.
In the presence of both Bush men, he promised to do everything to help them conclude a "peace agreement" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestine must destroy "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end with colonial activities, Bush declared and reminded both sides of the obligations arising from "road maps" to the peace they had adopted in 2003.
The head of the White House pointed out that the consultation between Israel and the Palestinian leadership of Abbas aims to "close the peace treaty which would solve all outstanding issues without exception, including central issues".
This declaration includes three issues that are at the core of the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the judgments of the Arab refugees who escaped during the conflict in 1948 from their homes in the territory of the state of Israel today.
Abbas took the words after the American president and stressed that the next meeting was "all-round and fundamental" and that it touched on all aspects of the solution, by referring to "Jerusalem, refugees, border, colony, water, security, etc.".
Then Olmert presented the court, which expressed the view that the next meeting should be "direct and continuous" and that it should be "based on being closed during 2008".
Bush defined the end of 2008 as the deadline for its "visiation of two states", of the Palestinian and Israeli that existed alongside him.
Saudi Arabia has found that from Bushem, it has made a commitment in this sense even before it decided to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is for Washington's success, launched a proposal adopted by all Arab countries, which Israel offers for the exchange of peace for the release of all Arab territories banned in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a cross in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Judge Prince Saúd in an interview, which he gave to an Arab-speaking daily protected Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutors, the police are not responsible.
What happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such details from the Black Chronicles, official versions do not agree with what is said between people.
What are the circumstances of accidents?
According to the first results of the investigation General Inspectorate of the French State Police (Inspection generale de la police nationale, IGPN), the police car drove through the town of Villaries-le-Bel on Sunday after 17 hours on the streets of Louise-Michel.
"The vehicle was not in the mode of impact, but was on the driver and passed at speeds of 40 to 50 km/h, however, there was no side light," explains the police source.
The green motorcycle of Kawasaki's sign, "unregistered, and thus without permission to drive on public communications" (read below), conducted by two young people without touching, went "very fast".
"The motorcycle drove from the left to the police car after it didn't go ahead," one police officer explained.
The blood alcohol flow test performed on the vehicle crew showed negative.
The state of the car (expressed front door, broken front desk, broken doors) is a witness to the folly of the attack.
The Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (Republique de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givry responded very quickly and announced yesterday that IGPN had committed "unintended killings and not providing assistance to people at risk", which was also involved in the departmental department de la süreté publicique du Val-d'Oise (the head of the National Police Department of Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation carried out by IGPN excluded the police responsibility for the accident at this stage.
Three witnesses' accidents that were in detail on Sunday evening were confirmed by the authorities "the police versions, although the mini-engine approached them relatively quickly on the left".
Any breath, no doubt caused by an earthquake on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles were locked up until the police car was able to break down.
The vehicle was secured and passed by a technical expert.
A drink was made on both of the victims yesterday.
What happened then?
Yesterday at Villaries-le-Bel, people were quick to talk about the police should quickly leave the scene without giving two young people first aid.
IGPN should also, in all caution, exclude "any serious accusation" in this paragraph.
"It is the most profitable aspect of the investigation which requires more patrol and which must be very careful," the police source quoted.
The "liberation" day met with a clear witness of those who followed after the accident for a few minutes.
One of his windows, however, leads directly to where the accident occurred.
"At once we were together with a nurse who is a nurse in the hospital, running down to try to find them," the witness reports.
I couldn't do anything."
Then he looked at the "fashioned, scared cop.
Two others tried to get one of the young and the fourth to speak on the phone."
Faced with the fast growing pressure and the certainty of the young people that the situation is hopeless, the police were taken by a car of colleagues who arrived in the middle.
According to the same witness, the rescue arrived "about twenty minutes after the police leave".
They also had a heart massage, but they're mad.
"Let no one claim that the police authorities have not come to help young people.
These young people were given the first aid.
The Hasids came right away.
Everything was done to save them," the prosecutor said.
Stress in Pakistan Growth
The Pakistani police stopped the first demonstration on Monday, two days before General Mustaraf announced his exceptional status.
In the city of Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2000 lawyers demonstrating measures taken against exceptional conditions were injured by grenades, which, according to the witnesses, used regular forces.
The last names were answered by a stone that several police officers were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were summoned.
Similar scenes like Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and attacked lawyers.
A few of them were to be called up.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court’s lawyers called for a general stand and announced demonstrations, resulting in about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
The access streets to the Supreme Court were closed in the morning with a view to preventing the assembly.
Other demonstrations were to take place in Multitan (center) and in Peshawar (north west).
On Monday, lawmakers were encouraged to support the religious parties involved in the political strong alliance Muttahida Mailis-e-Amal, whose president "sacrifice the population to send flowers to the judges who have taken their stand against the exceptional situation and the disappearances of those who have made an oath before the Musharaf".
"Musharof's promise is not paid"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly within the meaning of the extraordinary measure announced on Saturday evening.
The next day he had to express his views on the legal re-election of President Musharaf in the immediate presidential elections which took place on 6 October.
Judge Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry was removed and replaced.
"All we are witnesses is anti-fraud, anti-constitutional and anti-judgment against the Supreme Court," declared the official in The News.
Slib Parvize Musharafa, that he will issue an army command and become a civil president, "no pay" after an exceptional status has been introduced, announced on Monday the mayor of the Minister of Information Tariq Azem.
It was expected that the military uniform would be issued until November 15th when his first presidential mandate was completed.
The Minister of Information also confirmed that the nuclear elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also returned to the country with an ongoing speculation, which, according to the representative of the army chief, ordered the President of Musharaf's domestic prison.
More than three thirds of pregnancy continues to cause unexpected pregnancy
This amount includes the unplanned (24 %) pregnancy, either in the wrong way or in an unexpected way.
More than one pregnancy of three (36%) is still unexpected today, reflecting a study conducted by the French National Institute of études Demographics (Ined)- A State Constitution of Demographic Studies, for forty years after the adoption of the Neuvirtho Act, which passed anticoncept in France.
This amount includes the unplanned (24 %) pregnancy, either in the wrong way or in an unexpected way.
The various methods of anti-conceptives, which are hormonal or sterilization, continue to show 5% to 6% of the degree of failure, estimates Ined.
The anti-concept legislation, however, only made it possible to better "control of fertility", states the Constitution and notes that the rate of use of hormonal contraceptives among women between 20 and 44 years of age reached 60% from 5% in 1970.
Finally, eight generations of 10 today are well planned.
A couple of five has even been counted for months and if possible for eggs that are considered to be the most acceptable annual period for the birth of a child.
Aeronautics repair of space stations
For more than seven hours of space work, Scott Parazynski and his team members from the International Space Station (ISS) needed to complete the spacecrafted solar panel necessary for further scientific operation of the station.
It was about the risk output to the universe that collected records of the length of duration, distance from the usual modules, the speed with which it was planned and the measurements of the "cultivity" that the astronauts had invested in the repair.
The problems appeared on Tuesday, while the Discovery-ship astronauts set out the Harmony module, a large war effort designed to install European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see frameset).
This module is any plug-in request for modules-laborator.
But you need the power to supply electricity.
The second task of the team was to move the 17th-inch power-producing module through the solar panels already located on the ISS in order to fight at its final location.
After she moved her home, the team began to distribute the 70-foot solar panels of the module.
And there was one of the panels, which appeared to be a shady harmony, as a result of attaching a cable, damaged on the surface with a foot of less than a meter.
The layout has been stopped to prevent further panel damage.
Astronauts who were originally to conduct control exits on the Discovery ship and then to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was wrong were forced to sign up to the damaged panel.
And it was just Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic frame of the ship attached to the branch of the station, and did the right thing.
It's one of the best "space walkers" of the American Aviation and Space Agency (NASA).
High, static, very reverse, has a very well-developed chest and long neck.
In his 46 years, this doctor was entrusted with the original call to "opportunity" the " wound" solar panel.
After a detailed investigation of the damage, he fired the cable and secured a damaged place like "dile".
He helped him another spacewalker who stayed near the matching rooms, as well as inside, the other astronauts, including Peggy Witson, the leader of the team.
The tools he used, even minihokey-shaped insulated insulation means to prevent electric shock on solar panels producing several hundreds of volts, were found and "on-the-box" were produced by astronauts at the station.
After the operation ended, Scott Parazynski was waiting for the panel to be fully disbanded and then ventilated his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon the astronomers enjoyed a half-day rest before the day when seven astronauts returned to the Discovery ship to return to Earth in the middle as planned.
EADS' actions weaken
The EADS’ share in the Paris Stock Exchange is almost lost after the company operating in the aviation and defence industry announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion in order to meet the delay of A400M.
EADS has lost 4 % and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at EUR 21.96.
The financial group was obliged to reassess its expected production results for 2007 due to delays in the slow-down procedure for the development of the A400M flight engine, which is a condition for the start-up year.
The price for the delay in the supplies of a military cost flight, announced in October, has been calculated "at EUR 1.2 to 1.4 billion, more than a billion for Airbus", announced by the parent company of the European EADS designer.
In view of these costs, EADS will be required to report on the next Thursday, when presenting its quarterly results, a new review of the benefit before the calculation of the rates and duties (EBIT).
The group also found that the new cost calculation corresponds to a six-month delay.
Please note that the EADS production results in 2006 fell by 86 %, particularly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely A380.
The group initially assumed that the first delivery of A400M will be provided by the French army in October 2009.
Decision by status quo
Sunday's elections will take place with no delay: Russia will most certainly choose the side of President Putin, United Russia.
To confirm this, only after the end of a very small free pre-election campaign, its attractiveness towards stability, for the authorities.
Today, three days before the elections to the parliamentary Senate, Russian President Vladimir Putin will send voters to public justice stations with their content kept secret.
It is from the position of the leader of the United Kingdom, the propagandist, who celebrates all the trees of victory.
When yesterday he adopted the majority of foreign states, the president left nothing to complain about him and agreed with another attack on the West charged with interfering - his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we accept the fairest, perhaps the most transparent and most open, the choices without owning water on the beauty," he added.
It's not so far in the face of opposition.
They cancel the campaign marked by various pressures.
The Communist leader Gennaji Zjuganov says that "they never had so much fun, not for Jellcina."
After repressive demonstrations from last week, former world minister Gary Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, continues to prohibit visits by his lawyers.
"The Russians are left with the mind of the Soviets"
In the context of these parliamentary elections, two far- open questions are being raised:
- "Who will become Putin's representative in the presidential office?
Yesterday's official letter published the date of the first round of presidential elections, 2 March 2008; candidates may be represented by 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot exercise his third mandate in order.
However, no successor will appear.
- "What role will Putin play after lunch?"
Will he be the first?
Or the Head of Parliament's majority and all-powerful parties of the United Russia who choose the government and the president?
Whether that is so or not, the ruling power will win over the whole of Parliament, as in the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have remained mentally homo Soviets, they do not feel to be the lord of their judgment," sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
Historik Nikolaj Kopossov of the State University of Sankt-Petersburg is becoming increasingly distant: the civil society has acquired, in this country, the Christian five centuries after Europe, the delay; he has been the famous common spirit behind the creation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin referred to a state-of-the-art pattern of pateralism, which was perfectly accepted by the citizen, rather than that this new pateralism did not promote terror, but a certain economic prosperity," says Maria Lipman from Carnegie.
Today, the Russians are "blessing personal responsibilities", which they have recently demonstrated after the fall of the SSSR.
"What do you think?"
This phenomenon concerns all types of society, including the commercial world.
The official elite is intended to maintain the status quo: 65 Governors (of the total number of 85 heads of Russian regions) are running the local candidates of the United Kingdom.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, sonny chaos.
Public opinion gives priority to stability.
Also, in the name of the stability of Russia, extremes will not be preferred.

Difficulty Memory
After more than sixty years in the independent regime, the Nazi archives from Bad Arolsen, which number the courts of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are open to the public.
47 million archive documents placed within 27 km of Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were currently available only for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and specifically, at the request of the former victims or their eligible persons.
In May, the ten states entrusted with the management of archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed to open them to scientists and historians.
In view of the fact that the ratification process for this agreement is at the end of all States, yesterday's opening was effective.
Sensitivity information
Free access to Bad Arolsen allows you to examine "in particular the transfer of prisons, the population of camps and the health status of workers," explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives organized by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICCR).
Until recently, several states, among them Germany, opposed access to these so-called public documents because of the sensitive nature of some information.
What are supposed to be homosexuality or the mental achievement of some victims of deportation?
The records of the concentration camps or attacks made by the Gestapo were gathered after the war for the practical purpose of finding out whether or not the work was carried out by specific civilian populations, to provide evidence of their involvement with a view to opening the way for their damage.
More than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen still remain ten individual requests.
However, for the part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen represents only a limited contribution.
"From these documents nothing is expected to be completely new," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism at the University of Berlin.
The EU and India want to target free trade agreements in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India has already reached a total of EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
In 2008, the European Union and India expected the signing of the Free Trade Treaty, announced by European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
In the autumn of last year, EU Foreign Ministers gave the Green European Commission a green deal to sign the Free Trade Agreement (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Southeast Asian Associations (Asean).
The EU is India’s first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India, according to the European Commission, is the ninth trading partner of the EU.
"The Free Trade Agreement is hugely upsetting both economies" and "India is gaining better access to the 450 million Europeans prosperous," Peter Mandelson put it.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported to India, explained the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giant, together with the annual exchange of "47 billion euros in goods" and "10 billion euros in services", announced this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Dili, saying that bilateral trade "has not yet achieved its full potential". The EU and India meet on Friday at the eight joint diplomatic summit in New Dili, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosy.

The English bank took into account the concerns and offered 10 billion pounds in a five-day auction
The Bank of England stated in its fourth submission that it is intended to alleviate the current concern that the conditions on the credit market are again deteriorating and announced the 10th billion free bid in the five-week auction for a basic rate of 5.75 %, the offer which is not normally long-term.
"In an attempt to ease the fear that the conditions on financial markets will be very unacceptable at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty in the way of ensuring their position of preparedness for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant share of its planned reserves during the maintenance period starting on 6 December in the form of a five-day operation on the open market," she reported in the communiqué.
The Bank points out that 10 billion EUR (14 billion) will be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12-15 GMT until 10 January, at the basic rate.
It appears that it is the first thing BOE pushes on the financial market to be ready for a five-day open market operation.
They usually last a week.
BOE adds in its communiqué that "it remains ready to take other measures to maintain inter-bank loans at the same level as its basic rate".
The average interbank rate was 5,829 %.
The monthly rate was 6,6 %, which is the maximum number of 18 September.
Since the beginning of the annual financial crisis, sums have been placed on the financial market of the Bank of England associated with the payment rates made by the banks since the use of this offer.
According to certain speculative estimates of the accelerated development of the library course towards the euro, many more councils decided on the amounts placed on the financial market of the European Central Bank at lower rates and less guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union per un public movement, Union for Human Rights) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to reject Socialists (PS) proposals on purchasing capacity
The UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss on Thursday the individual paragraphs of the socialist proposal of the Competitiveness Act, which is equivalent to rejecting the text.
At the end of the day, the text of the proposal was received within the framework of a so-called socialist "ship" (a meeting initiated by a single parliamentary club) and contained a dozen measures taken by the PS's Tuesday presidency, including an increase in employment premium of 50 %, a renewal of the current TIPPs, a transport check or a rental regulation.
In view of the fact that UMP and NC voted against the conduct of individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the meeting was concluded after the general debate, which was an opportunity to exchange views, sometimes longer, between majority and opposition, several hours before the television performance of Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing.
The Head of Ambassadors PS Jean-Marc Airault announced that his club will once again submit these proposals in their capacity in addition to the amending proposal of the Finance Act, which will be held next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of many speculation that C3 Presents in Philadelphia is establishing a new festival, this promoter/producer Vineland Festival in New Jersey announced in collaboration with the British Republic Festival Melvin Benna.
"It is a privilege for our company to work with a man who, without any prejudice, inspired a contemporary festival in America," said Charlie Jones from C3 server Billboard.com.
C3 produces Chiagský festival Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in New Jersey is an annual destination camper station.
The festival should take place from 8 to 10 July on a private farm with 500 acres of solution, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most famous festival organizers.
In 1989, Cormide Reading Festival was held in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn joined the Leeds Festival portfolio, and in 2006 the Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, also has production, license and organizational tasks at Glostonbury Festival, which currently has up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 points out that Glastonbury is "the most inspiring event" that he has ever experienced and says that his company and Melvina Benna are working together to give the region a festival event of European style.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with Fairmount Parks Commission we worked hard to establish a festival in the center of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"I was with the city and the Commission was motivated and inspired by the project.
However, we regret that the current leadership of the city has led us into politics, provided by Charlie Jones.
" Luckily we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Ben and we want to establish a great festival at an exceptional place that will serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 In 2005, the Lollapalooza festival was inaugurated at the Chicago Grant Park, after it was held at the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The two major markets for 2007 were 9.8M and 11.3M.
Both of these festivals are held in the city.
"The European model Melvina Benna festival is playing outdoors while our festivals are being held on green media in cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to include in a certain way both food so that we can create both the idea of a foreign festival after Europe and of a city after America."
Vineland is located on half the road between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"In addition to Vineland, including the elderly, it supports the realization of this event with enthusiasm," says Charlie Jones.
The last appointed refusal to create the terms of the agreement, however, states that "it is sufficient to allow them to invest in such events and to welcome festivals that will have, hopefully, long-term duration".
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high", like the capacity of Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which takes 80,000 people.
He says that the groups have already received invitations, but nothing can be confirmed at the time the program is first sent to the press.
"Vineland will have a rock floor, music will be there, but it will be a desert so we can draw a wide spectrum of fans if possible," says Carlie Jones.
C3's partners, who received the price of Top Independent Promoter in the last year of Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal Heads of Terminals
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when it's set up by Terminator itself...
This certification mission is one of the tasks of the delegation.
However, his mandate is "politically good" because Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
It's hard to get the Governors into trouble?
"It must be careful, it's the industry who decides where it goes.
If he finds that the conditions in Montreal are arbitrary, he'll go there.
Our job is to offer those who will consider them the best," he said.
Festival honey
At this point, however, Denise Turcotte is a priority for the promotion of local film.
It's already started for Oskary.
At all Western border festivals, whether about festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it's about to present Quebec films, warn them and ensure that directors give talks.
A few weeks ago, the age of darkness had a good publicity on the 30th year of Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will be presented on Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is offering in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th anniversary of the Old Denver Film Festival.
This month Québec also presented four short-term and four full-time films at American Film Institute Festival.
Will it come at the end of the year on the storm to the marathon? Experts have divided the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remains at the end of the year and investors are already expecting me to reach the traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts aren't so sure they're coming to him.
Bank Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view it's between the month of December on the storm of positive progress".
However, it is not possible to provide a preliminary ruling on the basis of statistics, in particular because, at least in the current context of the market, there are certain doubts."
These experts do not assume that in the last few weeks the stock market is falling apart, and they state that "the stock market maintains the existence of liquidity which is ready to invest in the absence of guarantees, in particular of a strong income affected by the return on quality securities, as in the long and short term".
It is therefore believed that the storm will have a more calm process, never without volulity, "especially since I do not know the impact of the likely fall in the FED (Federal Reserve System), given the high level of oil prices and the risk of inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, the leading sales of BPI banks in Spain, agrees that it is not the right time to declare that he will come to the marathon.
"There are not too many reasons for joy," says this expert.
Ibex lost almost 4 % of the maximum values recorded on 8 November when the index closed at 15 945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, analytic Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could end the year on something close to 16,000 points thanks to the repurchasing of portfolios and traditional deposits on pension insurance that is coming to you every year at this time.
However, this expert indicates that this year will be somewhat different because it is thought that maraton will arrive first, in the second Sunday after the extended week on the occasion of the Day of the Constitution.
The above analysis is not expected to affect market orientation.
Federico Olucha, analytic Inverses Banco, also estimates that we are approaching technical level and "that is why we could observe an index published by US reports on the impact of the crisis on the credit market".
Analytics believe these effects will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of titles that make it possible to draw Ibex into new maximum codes.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that this year is a series of strong titles.
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
In contrast, Federico Olucha from Inverses Banko ensures that growth is taking place in the hands of banking and industrial sectors.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich this maraton if it comes to him.
"ACS has been gaining position for several months now and we hope that other construction companies, such as Railway and FCC, will go the same way," explains the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales during the evening.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that technology will also be very good, even if there are not too much representation on this field in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been only two months of losses.
The actual marathon ended at the end of the year 2003 in the year when the stock markets ended the crisis created by the collapse of the technology pipeline.
This year, when Ibex 35 received back 28,17%, the average growth was 6.68%.
We will also see whether 2007 will be in line with the fifth benefit year (while Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether he will be able to have his marathon at the end of the year.
Two banks of the Bank of Popular will have 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
The Bank of Popular has decided to modernise most of its parts.
About two seats, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These sections carried out under the Popular Max sign are a big change for the bank.
Similarly for other Spanish entities, because it is the first group that decided to make such a jump and put on an open time until 20.30 p.m. and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 p.m.
BBVA, another group which has also repeatedly assured itself that it wants to extend its opening time, has not yet decided on this step.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the opening-up committee of 75 % of its parts on Saturday for the extension of the opening-up period by one afternoon, although never for the public.
The results of this experience will be decisive in order for other entities to join in this initiative which supports the opening date of trade, accession or none.
That's exactly the purpose of the project that popular bank ran away.
Find individual customers who are exposed to these sites for their purchases, smaller and medium-sized enterprises, livelihoods and trades from selected streets where they will come to open the premises.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these sections throughout Spain for about 18 months, because it is not about opening new ones, but only about fixing existing ones.
For this reason, the bank modernises the areas already in commercial areas by adapting the customer profile in individual streets.
This is the extension of the opening time complemented by another meal of the area and with a new, more modern design in lighter colors.
The Managing Director of the Bank of Ángel River ensures that this restructuring will not mean a large investment, but a larger number of staff, as it goes from six employees to eight to nine.
The sides will even have room for small and medium-sized companies and will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group.
The Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid areas.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel River explains.
The sides of the Madrid streets were chosen Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía and according to Rivera it seems to have been a happy choice.
The Popular Bank currently has 2,500 sides.
And the other 60 specialised immigrants who are executed under the Mundocredit sign also have a very long opening time and open even on Sundays and holidays.
The PopularMax sides will not follow the BBVA model when its range offers a large scale of non-financial products for sale.
"We don't want to compete with our clients," says Rivera.
They just agreed with Telephonic on the sale of mobile phones through external staff.
Telecinco first doubled the value of its Antena 3 rival
We proved it.
This world yesterday, Paolo Vasile, Executive President Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the conclusion of the trade when he found that the television he runs doubled the value of his Anteny 3.
Only one thing said his joy: 'What I hate is that it didn't happen because we'd grow up more, but because we're less close' he declared.
And yet he stressed that thanks to the weak market, 'we've dropped less.'
Telecinco finished its sale yesterday at 2,54 %.
This profit resulted in their loss of 15,66 % per annum.
According to Bloomberg's data, this company's gross value of Mediaset (about 52% capital) for Vocenta (other 13%) is up to €4,488.88 million.
Her competitor Antena 3, which last night dropped by 1,52 % and dropped by 40,5 % since last winter, has a half-value of 2,193,46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that were assessed was 3,571 billion in Sogecable, 2,518.53 million Prisa (issuer Cinco Días) and 1,779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is offered because we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is, how much we are able to do this on the same market, what price and how we assess it in consistency.'
Telecinco announced last week that this year it is starting with the acquisition of billions of gross revenue from advertising as its first television channel, as Giuseppe Tringali, executive president Telecinco and Publispaña, has been providing the group's advertising sites.
If the expected data are actually targeted, this television channel would mark an increase of 3,6 % of advertising by 965,4 million in 2006.
In the first nine months of the year, Antony’s net sales increased by 1.6% (and reached 734.4 million), while net revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors to be considered by analysts is the increase in the relatively relative development of Telecinco on the bridge, which has so far been maintained: in 2006 this company, which is already chairled by Alejandro Echevarría, divided between its shareholders 100% of its profit.
Vasile ensures that although it is soon to decide, this coefficient could be changed after buying 33 % of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always reported much more.
This year I hope we will be able to calm down our shareholders, whom we have already increased the value of 33% Endemoul.
According to analysts, the market at these times shows a certain trend.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced his profits from Telecinco, which was 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is because it explains that the projected increase in revenue was stopped from 0.5 % to 8.4 % in 2008 and from 5.5 % to 5.1 % in 2009.
This company also reduced the expected gain of Anteny 3, which is 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.

Congress approved the transfer of MiFID from 1 November to 1 November
In conjunction with Parliamentary meetings, which were completed today by the vote of the Congress on New Members of the Senate on a proposal for a law, the government has made a public hearing of a regulation which develops a new law with a view to both entering into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of individual parties have consistently stepped up the efforts of the Members and Senators to unite and agree on the best rule to ensure the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of the entities necessary for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which is governed by the Securities Trading Act, proposes the modernisation of financial markets and at the same time strengthens investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Commission on the Market with securities (CNMV) and supports cooperation between the individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new provision allows for the provision of financial advice services for both specialised companies, both physical and legal persons and creates a new type of company providing financial services (ESIS), financial advice company (AFI), which are associated with companies with valuable papers, intermediate paper offices and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of operating systems with financial instruments is widened so that cross-border trading systems and internalisation systems will be connected to regulated secondary markets that will compete with the current windscreen.
The Act further obliges companies providing investment services to disseminate information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and ways of dealing with risk and requires a list of all operations carried out to facilitate monitoring by CMMV.
During the session of the Congress Trade Commission, several adjustments were included, among other things, resulting in the view of the "complicated" financial instrument in view of the high risk for investors which was demonstrated by the high risk-weighted mortgage debt in the United States (subprime).
The revision of the Directive was also used for the legal exercise of functions which could stop balarians in the field of economics and business management 30 years after the Royal Decree was adopted in 1977, which relates to professional economic functions.
At the same time, the Senate has organised new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary who will work externally, will not require CNMV's permission and will be able to provide trade services with products and customers for different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised ISC increased by five decimal places in November to 4.1 %
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the European Union’s inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices have developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication is consistent with Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) policies to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated by using the same process as used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices but by using different methods of statistical modeling for calculation of information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Statute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative, and therefore it should not be necessary to agree with the final data entered in the notice of 14 December this year.
"ISC will continue to maintain relatively high levels"
The Second Vice-President of the Government and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes said that the November increase of ISC to 4.1% is "the number of times", however, he predicted that the price index would be still at the relatively "high" level in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes in Congress halls explained that "even if this is not a valid number", Spain's inflation difference against the currency union is still "more or less" in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than last month when the government did not count on such a high increase.
"We expected about 4% of the value," the Minister of the Economy pointed out to the data presented today.
Virginia is planning to work with Northern Rock 42 billion euros in three years.
From the time the Bank of England had received Northern Rock into the crisis in half of its time and had to flee to the necessary credit from the Bank of England, its deposits dropped by more than 50 % to 12 billion euros (16.8 billion euros).
The Bank then fixed record deposits of more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually did not trust customers for two and a half months, although the government offered a percentage guarantee for these money and extended it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, whose name replaces its business financial sign, Virginia Money needs to get around a quarter of the revenue invested in the British banks in the next three years so that it can earn the remaining 18 billion pounds and achieve its 30 billion targets.
The Group of Magnets Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom by its ideal advertising campaigns, is planning to spend 50 million euros (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its business.
This week, the Northern Rock Bank marked the offer of the Virginia Consortium, which creates three other companies, such as here that give priority to saving them from bankruptcy.
Old Totany arrested for certain corrupt practices on construction
Today, the civilian guard maintained the contemporary age of the city of Totana (from the People's Party) due to its alleged involvement in corrupt practices at the construction that had been uncovered this week.
One of the Secretary-Generals of the Office and the Chief of Local Police was further arrested.
José Martínez Andreo won this year's flower Juana Morales, a contemporary humane envoy and until the age of the city, which according to the research sources of Cadena SER's TV, could have been the 'main' of the entire company.
The police continue to monitor the building boards and the building commissions and no further arrests will occur in the next hours.
In addition, Justice Juan Morales, a chief suspect of corrupt practices at the construction, was accused of having been removed early this week.
As Cadena SER informed yesterday, the lawyer of the 'humane' envoy Juan Morales, who was checked, arrested while leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
In addition, according to the research resources, Morales' data selection is provided for by his signature of an agreement with a military construction company that was overqualified 200 hectares of land.
It's currently held by eight people.
Bono has accepted the offer of state in front of the PSOE candidates and, if they win, the President of Congress
The former Defence Minister José Bono has taken the initiative of the President of the government and the general secretary of socialist José Luise Rodrígueze Zapater to become president of the Congress in the next general elections in front of the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Party) candidate list in Toledo and if socialists win general elections.
So at the press conference, the PSOE secretary for José Blanco and Bono himself announced this after meeting with Zapater, who passed this morning in the federal seat of the party.
The executive chief of the former minister's offer led to the fact that in political life "it is important to count with the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems," that La Manchy's policy will be a candidate for a socialist party to the President of Congress if socialists win in the next elections.
As President of the Congress, Manuel Marín would have rewarded his decision on 15 November not to apply in the next general elections and leave his active political career in order to combat climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the president of the government has continued to urge him to return to the top policy he left two years ago.
He further pointed out that just as the public knowledge of who will be the home of the Minister of Economy, if PSOE wins the elections, his party wanted to notify the President of the Congress "transparent form".
If Bono gets this function, he hopes that the Snow will change to "homes of respect and never surrender or cry" and aims to "will be more like citizens".
"Sometimes it appears that the only place in Madrid where there is no peace and peace to speak is Congress, the president of the government in Senate has been interrupted 26 times at the same time."
Similarly, he addressed current President Manuel Marín and his "good work" and did not want to introduce himself to his place to avoid falling into the way he indicated what his opponents might consider "majesty".
Climactic propaganda
In view of the fact that the campaign against climate change is disparate with unmerited follow-up, both those who look suspiciously at its predictions, and those who take the lead in other political and social conflicts, there must be strong support.
In addition, to have the leader of the campaign, which is the president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and is even able to sign a "new agreement with the planet".
This proposal encourages him to explain why the activities or inaction of his Government have contributed significantly to the failure of Spain to comply with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this failure in which the sectors in which it takes place and why his government, the government of the contract, has not prevented it.
In addition, it encourages him to explain to the Spanish what measures he is going to take to speed up climate change.
As a result, companies will be affected, which will have to change the customs of citizens, which energy support, individual and collective will have to be accepted and which will have economic consequences.
In other words, who is the victim and who pays for saving the planet.
But we didn't expect such explanations, nor do we.
Just because they have to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are not popular.
Dear, inadmissible and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one cent from the price of gasoline proposed by PSOE (Spanish socialist side), Zapatero seemed so risky from the point of view of his refusal.
In other words, it's about saving the planet so it's not going to stop, it's a clean propaganda, it's a password that gives any real meaning.
The following shall be added:
And the covenants of the planet; this Lord is so beneficial to the campaign which he doesn't speak, he doesn't charge, he doesn't ask for anything, but he is kind to the lips, and he stirs it up.
If it's limited to being a virtual party and it doesn't require us to ride around and relax with the believers.
Senior and local police chief Totany detained for suspicion of corrupt practices at construction
As the investigation sources reported, the Civil Guard arrested the age of the city of Totana, "people" José Martínez Andreo, the chief local police officer, the secretary of the workshop and one of the contractors in custody, for suspecting of the spread of criminal acts at the construction site.
The old man was arrested in his apartment and transferred to a workshop in which he is now in contact with a number of police officers who have also provided to the Commission for building and the City Company for the management of industrial land and housing.
These three arrests came to six last Mondays in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, during operations related to overcrowding of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on the ground suitable for the establishment of the Nuaria police company, after payment of illegal supplies during the past electoral period, to build 4,000 homes.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested, but they were charged in a short trial at the first instance of Totana.
Six of the first prisoners were handed over to the court today.
According to the information sources, an investigation has been made by the former President of Totany and today a member of the autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales.
His ex-wife, owner of the real office, registered today in Totana and also his contemporary friend who lives in Murcia, was charged with the main autonomous area.
Manuel N. A., the director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and a business operator from Viga, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra Province), as well as Pablo José M. G., the director of the company Suelo de Imonauur, which belongs to that group and is subject to a transfer of charges.
The investigation is carried out by a group of criminal acts in the construction of the Central Operations Unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to their arrests, also carried out eleven visits, most of the companies associated with the prisoners, with residence in Madrid, Vigu, Murcia, Pontevevre, Las Rozas (Madrid province) and Totaná.
At the time, there was only one person in Totana, a very well-known owner of the company on products from a live meat that could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria group was entrusted with the establishment of the largest residential complex in Totany City, which would represent more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company obtained 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was overqualified and its project had to double the settlement of a population of 25,000.
The Nuaria Group forms companies such as Autesa and Inomonauur, which are awarded market support, Conycase, which runs parking in Corunë, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico in Vigo City, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing and Preconiza focusing on the promotion, sale and installation of construction products.
And that's happening.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
If you're not against, we leave the Book of the Month side and we need another assessment and competition between us.
I already have something in my head.
People, life is changing.
You can always come up with ideas.
Two.
Our Finnish writer has sent us this comment from the earlier issue of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsinki Sanomat (through the introduction of the PISA report on education levels in the world), which refers to what the news published on 18 November, on the same day when the context of the book of Blackburn also came to light:
"The content of the subject of philosophy emerged in public discussions regarding the tragedy at school in the city of Jokel.
The victim's ear, the high school student, quoted in their accounts the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, a professor in charge of the subject of philosophy, asked the day-to-day professors to take a critical view of Plato's and argue that it is not necessary to use Nietzsche in the official course of philosophy at secondary schools."

One colleague shall inform you of the introduction of a criminal offence from the Internet into a criminal law:
A. Acquisition of one song would be a criminal offence from six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you go to the table at a price of less than 400 euros, it is considered to be just a break (§ 623.1).
B. If you refuse to trade up to EUR 1000, the theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than the fine (section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal the car and return it in 40 hours, the penalty is still lower than before storage (§ 244.1)
D. It's less important to participate in the cracks than the change in the compacts.
Participate in a three-month period of one year (§ 154 of the Penal Code) and exchange of the compacts would be from six months to two years
(section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at employment is considered under § 184.2 of the Criminal Code less serious than filming on DVD.
F. Unauthorised distribution of films protected by copyright is more than the provision of pornographic material by young people (§ 186).
So if my colleague doesn't make a mistake, someone's got his hand on it, and that's all right.
4. (a) What does the Bible teach us?
My treating doctor is one of his articles on weird research called "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Or feelings that cause monthly payments to employees depend on how many colleagues they make.
The study was carried out at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonances tomography and the results were published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernda Weber, author of the study and lead group Life &Brain show: "The biggest activity came when the research participant responded correctly and his colleague mistakenly."
The researchers observed that if both were successful, they would get the same pay, the assets were peaceful, but when one got doubles, the assets were higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much knowledge.
Balcanese peas
For eight years Carla del Ponte has been following the State Prosecutor's Office of the Court of Justice in the Hague crime of the Balkan War.
Its mandate will be extended by the end of the year and Carla will go away with mixed feelings because the main perpetrators of mass massacre in Srebrenica, where 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radavan Karadzic, are still on their way.
Their names are listed by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach's documentary film "Karlin List" (2006, not listed in Spain) which, at the time of the detective trigger from Belgrade after New York, was followed by Swiss complaints to investigate the alleged crimes and pressure on the States concerned in order to block the network.
What insurance is appropriate for me?
Insurance of a car which is protected by a driver in the event of an accident. It represents a significant expenditure which depends on various factors such as age, status, gender, duration of driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
To have a car is just the beginning.
Choosing a suitable vehicle insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to explain what we're talking about.
Vehicle insurance is an agreement between insurance and insurance.
This commitment takes the form of an insurance contract, which provides that the insurance will receive an agreed security amount at a certain level in order to take into account the age of payment damage in the event of an accident.
The insurance price shall be fixed taking into account the different factors such as age, status, gender, length of driving licence, type of vehicle which is insurance or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the higher the likelihood of accidents, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both 25-year-olds and women must pay less insurance, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of controls, insurance companies have concluded that those living in marriage are less dangerous than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will have an impact on the frequency of driving and on the likelihood of an accident.
The increase in speed increases the probability of driving.
There are many variables that insurance authorities consider when they determine the price of the insurance.
Therefore, the driver must carefully study the situation in order to allow such insurance as is best suited to his insurance profile.
We will show here the most important change in the choice of insurance or type of insurance that will be also at reasonable cost in addition to the treatment of the type of insurance.
Young people in their 50s meet with various disadvantages such as little experience with running and short holding of a driver’s license if they want to meet at a affordable price.
Although the ideal for good coverage is insurance against all risks, there are even cheaper options.
The most appropriate drivers can choose insurance against all risks with low insurance in order to obtain safe coverage of all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would suggest the client's participation in compensation for certain events.
"Part of the compensation for the security event that will be provided by the customer in advance when determining the price of the security that will be higher than the lower eye would be co-operated," explains Luis Noguera, head of First Europe in Spain, internet insurance broker.
Another option is insurance extended to other participants by ensuring that the customer is against other persons affected by injury but not against his own car.
In addition, it would be secured against theft, fire and vehicle losses.
Recommendation.
If you are younger than twenty-five years old, try to be careful and put into danger as soon as possible, because it affects your bonus and enables you to reduce the security in the future.
Bonus is a reduction of the basic fee that the insurance company has.
On the contrary, small is the increase of the basic rates mentioned.
"Bonus and Little will depend on insurance and her profit.
If she had a good insurance year, she'd be able to afford to raise the bonus," explains Noguera.
After crossing the border for twenty-five years, drivers will have it easier to meet insurance because the customer's risk index is reduced by the experience they have acquired.
For this reason, it is most recommended to meet insurance against all risks.
"Young people are usually unable to take advantage of the experience gained before it comes to disaster and even when it comes to management," says the head of European society in Spain and adds that most of the accidents occur in the second year of the operation when "trembling" has already been overcome.
However, if a client is married but has no children yet, it is better to sit down insurance against all the risks if this also allows his economic situation.
Families with children are considered as insurance for a client with the lowest risk index and therefore their relationship will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a low insurance (which could be 300 euros) or at a high bonus, insurance extended to other operators starting in the third year from the purchase of a vehicle.
"Their management is more calm and their purchasing capacity is higher, so they can allow themselves to get the highest price here," says Luis Noguera.
Debts are recommended for insurance against all risks with a low insurance (of EUR 150) or extended insurance to other operators if a high bonus has been achieved.
It should be said that car insurance is important not only because it protects drivers in the event of disaster but also because it represents a significant expenditure, which is a good reason for a proper study of insurance options, which would most of us reflect on our personal situation.
Celtic tries to get to AC Milan point that means osmiffinal
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their forces this afternoon at San Siro Stadium in an attempt to get a point that they fail to achieve their respective goals at the end of the "Champions" league, because for Italy this would mean being the first and in Scotland it would decide to take place.
The Italians have ten points and they have already taken the fifth round of action in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but one more is needed to ensure that Shachzyor does not get six points before him, which will play with Benfiko, who has four.
These two groups of D will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, because AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Frontier in Japan, where it will first appear in the 13th in the semifinal, in an attempt to get to the finish playing the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed earlier than the other and inconsequential outcome at the Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems to be the most likely, even though both men are trying to talk about winning because Italy will not want to act on domestic ground, and Celtic knows that after winning, it would be the first and will ensure a better place in the eight finals.
Gordon Strachana's husband could even become a loser if he doesn't win, but he can't rely on it because at the same number of nine points, Ukrainians who lost last week in Glasgow (2:1) but won in the first direct strike (2:0).
And so the AC Milan players try to hurt night Scots who believe that they will get to the semi-finals in the reorganised Champions League just as they won in the same competition in the previous competition all over Kaka in the extension (1:0) after position 0:0 in the basic game time.
Hope they win "rossoneri" will be Schachtzyor, for whom the prize of victory is only if Celtic has won, and this is both for the process of the osmiffinal and for serving in UEFA.
Benfia, although it is the last and it is not possible to continue in the highest European competition in order to win a third place by one win, so it would play in UEFA.
The first concert in the tournament of Spice Girls attended 20 000 people in Vancouver
The Spice Girls group started in Vancouver, Canada, some 20,000 times before its first tour since its release in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Hallwell) soon before they started their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver, they announced that their group's reunification was "great".
About 20,000 people bought tickets so they could be present at a concert that included videos that included the stories of this group that drew attention to the feelings at the end of the 1990s.
Returns and world tournaments are played at the same time as they have a new album released by the EMI in Spain, which brings their main successful recordings as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on the cover of beautifully decorated banners given to them by their husband "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
This sportsman was in the public who sailed GM Place, although the nerve Victoria forbade him a few days ago.
Before the show started, Victoria Beckham said about the British star that "he didn't even see our costumes, so I'm nervous about what he thinks about the show".
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "on account of differences between us" resulted two years later in the release of the fifth group, also gave his nervousness during a meeting with the journalist two hours before the start of the presentation.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion had changed, the view of Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I decided," Chisholm said about the reunification of the group she left nine years ago.
The singer also noted that, in time, things were "dark and we're all very happy".
However, many things have changed since Spice Girls finally appeared together in 1998.
So at the beginning, according to CTV, the team flew to Vancouver by Virginia Airlines.
On the flight, an army of dogs was waiting at the airport.
Five have 7 children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the group will be held in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
It will be held in Madrid on 23 December.
Warnings from new floods between Russia and Ukraine
Between Russia and Ukraine there is a dispute about the price of land flow, thus increasing the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel can be affected in Western Europe.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is kept under way across Ukraine and any dispute between these two countries is closely monitored.
Kyev warned that if Moscow raises prices in Ukraine, Russia will account for higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between these two years has reduced supplies to the EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kyjev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, owned by the gas monopoly, Gazprom, is trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says Ukraine will have to account for more, because it agreed to pay up to 50% more than the gas received from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most significant gas transit states during the negotiations," said Reuters Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinach.
"The changes in gas prices should certainly be linked to our arguments regarding the rise in transit fees (to Western Europe) across Ukraine."
The latest major dispute between Moscow and Kyiv led to a reduction in supply from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has led to a wooden export path to Western Europe, which has recently increased prices.
The Russian gas represents one quarter of the supply to the European Union.
Russia has the world's largest gas resources, but most of them remain underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supplies with electricity from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Republics.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The inspector said the NHS Scottish Chambers must improve the control of criminal records in non-European employees.
A recommendation from the President of the Supreme Control Authority Robert Black came after a foreign doctor operating in Scotland was involved in a red attack on the Glasgow airport.
Mr Black is also afraid that the Scottish NHS does not have a precise representation of the number of foreign staff he is employed.
But his report stressed that other key controls were carried out in order to sample five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Control Authority was concerned immediately after the red attacks on personnel received from the country outside the European Economic Area.
Eighty-eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was held at the airport after someone hired Jeepem into the main terminal door.
He was one of the three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court, accused of being involved in a bombing attempt in Great Britain.
From the NHS chamber, it is expected to check the foreign staff on qualifications, experience and authorisation for work in Great Britain before his employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses Disclosure Scotland for the control of criminal records, this agency has no authority to obtain such information outside Britain.
The report of the President of the Supreme Control Authority says, apart from other recommendations, that the Commission should be allowed to submit guidelines to the Criminal Records Bureau, which will help staff with controls in several countries.
"Because we have found that part of the staff records contained evidence of these controls, they are not carried out regularly," the report reported.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish NHS agreed in many ways with its own policy of transitional checks, but he also added: "Our report warns of areas where the system could be improved in order to ensure the availability of accurate information on the quantity of foreign personnel."
The president of BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry, said that it is "very unlikely" that transitional controls would identify potential employees of NHS who would be able to commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report indicates that current transitional controls in Scottish NHS are working well and it is not clear which other value these notes bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities reported that there are currently 1,161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and sisters.
However, the President of the Supreme Control Authority warned that these numbers would probably be higher because the Commission had a problem of identifying staff with residence permit.
The investigation also found that the control procedures taken by NHS authorities in the areas of Airshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lotian have been carried out to a large extent.
They included passport controls, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently processing the policy and the Transit Control Directive for foreign NHS workers.
The Ministry of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to do this work immediately after a terrorist attack on the Glasgow airport."
It also added that the Scottish Government, in accordance with the Health Committees, will consider the recommendation of this report and ensure that the best procedures are made available in the updated directives on trans-occupier control of all staff, including foreign personnel, which plans to issue next month.
Joy Division manages film prices
Control, a life-saving film about the famous singer Joy Division Janu Curtis, collected five prices on the British Independent Film Awards, including prices for the best film.
Prices were also obtained by the star Sam Riley, who worked until Curtis's role in the warehouse, director Anton Corbin and next to Toby Kebell.
Lady Judy Dench was named the best herke for the thriller's record of scandal.
And the band star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for getting a British film on the world scene.
The price was widely distributed in the London Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis's path to glory with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black film - his soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - stood only 3 million free.
But he won a Dutch photographer Corbin, formerly known as an iconic obela U2 Joshua Tree, two prices - for the best regime and for the best debuting director.
The rock music was the focus of another rating - because the film Juliena Temple about the singer Clash Joe Strummer received the award for the best document.
Viggo Mortensen won the plaque for the best leader of the Russian Mafia boss in the London thriller David Cronenberg's Easter.
Ray Winston, whose reputation is based on the role of tough guys, won the price of Richard Harris for an extraordinary contribution to the British film.
This teenager, including Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another part of Indiana Jones - The Kingdom of Christian Lebbles.
Winston said he was proud of this price, which is named after the star of Camelot and Harry Potter Harris who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, the great hero of his time, I'm very proud."
Independent film prices, known as Biffy, are made together with filmmakers, heroes and festival organizers.
Between stay and boss Bif is Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Ngyy, Meera Syalová and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people for terrorist spying
Last night, Saudi Arabia announced that 208 soldiers had been arrested for membership in the cells preparing for an immediate attack on fuel equipment and also on spiritual and security components.
The state television of the largest oil exporter reported that one of the cells wanted to enter the country.
Sympathetic al-Qaidi led the campaign against monarchy, the United States' allies, from 2003, and from invasion to Iraq.
The television report reported that eight foreign-led troops were planning an attack on a red machine in Ash-Sharqiyah Province.
Saudi Arabia has a rapid response to the force of 35,000 members to prevent an unexploded attack on al-Qaida on the world’s largest mining factory in Abkhaiq in 2006.
The report quoted the Ministry's internal declaration: 18 prisoners belonged to a bunker led by "expert on rocket detonation", which he declared to the country.
It further indicates that the military planned to destroy the kingdom by eight shots.
22 arrests were to be prepared for the killing of spiritual and safety workers.
The government offered spiritual help to further prevent Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaida soldiers fighting related troops and Shiite government supported by the United States, which Saudi conservative sunnipers consider to be quasi-cais.
Al-Qaedish militias are believed to have purchased many spiritual bodies in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that rules the government.
Militants - supported by the challenges of the leader al-Káidy Saúda We use bin Ládin to focus on the Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy equipment.
"This war was a huge effort of security forces in the past... five months," said state television to the Ministry's inside speaker.
There was also a 16-member "medial bunk" in Medina, which was intended to promote "takfirian thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports violence against Muslims marked as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the prisoners were also 32 persons accused of providing financial support to the military.
The climate in Venice is probably a view of the future of the Earth
The scientists announced yesterday that Venus could have been a pleasant place for life.
Data from running European stations show that the planet is even more similar to the wave of Earth than it once thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
These two worlds are equally large and run after similar expensive ones, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that thousands of years ago there were conditions similar to those on Earth and could also be civilized.
But the alarmed greenhouse effect caused by light oxygen, atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and the lower rate of return sent Venusi on a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is without water, the temperature on the surface is quite hot on the canvas roof and leaves it with storm and wind of hurricane power.
Findings from the probes of the European Space Agency Venus Express, which studied the planet for one year, offer a balanced view of how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the physics cathedral of Oxford University and one of the leading missions Venus Express said: "It is as clear as ever that the climate in Venice is as different from the Earth, although the planets themselves are quite different.
"Our new data enables us to set up a scenario in which Venus began the same way as Earth, perhaps with the civil environment, billions of years ago."
The police kept the "rich uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, probably enriched uranium, was detained by the Slovenian and Hungarian police yesterday.
The police officer said three people were arrested and the material was confiscated.
He did not confirm that it was a enriched uranium, but he said that this substance could be sold for $1 million (480,000 free).
Continue running
Mitt Romney said it is not appropriate for presidential candidates to answer snowflake questions.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates subsequently agreed with the discussion on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and presented them to the candidates sent.
None of the questions raised in mid-November 28th were as comical as a snowball who asked Democrats about global warming in the debate on the other side of YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected a lot of the Republican situation that led to the elections next year.
It is not clear how exactly CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, chose clips that were then shown by inspiring candidates.
But the first half of the debate, the longest time devoted to the only subject, was focused on immigration.
This issue is one of the most powerful topics in the Republic.
CNN asked the panel of undecided voters to turn around when they heard something interesting: the voter noted the tops of the agreement when the candidates were talking about the hard access to borders.
The firmest and longest exchange of views came between Rudy Giulian, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who was first elected in key votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to track down the story of a man who was like a New York receptionist soft on an illegal traveler.
He challenged Mr. Romney, accusing the former government of Massachusetts of renting illegal immigrants to work at his home.
These two were particularly cautious when the graduates asked whether any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (give illegal immigrants normal status and citizenship).
Further candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, were able to come up with their little bit on this subject.
None of the two have a chance to nominate, but they're both in the game about having begun to beat on the shoulders because of their immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least the candidates have the same view of immigration: greater presence on borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, along with concerns about contemporary Chinese players and other concerns about the environment, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the gap between freedom and Christian conservatives.
But the debate began to be very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had previously supported the possession of firearms.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the simulation heating technique should be considered torture.
One prosecutor asked whether the candidates believed every word from the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani concluded by saying that even though the Bible is his favorite book, it is likely that he does not believe in the account of Jonah and the hero.
Another prisoner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now opposed to all assumptions at the first place in his recent research in Ioë thanks to his long-term Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty is unacceptable but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too clever to apply to himself.
The room is usually open.
Mr. Huckabae's presence in Iou is covered by recent success in making money and in voting for the pleasure of Ron Paul during the midterm debate.
These two were reflected from the bottom because both sides were still unable to agree on more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates joined the party very quickly and convincingly with a victory report on the American size on the rhete, marking on both sides.
This time the side is split and the result is far from uniform.
Laboratorial Diseases
Gordon Brown again found a trap he could fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although this is a common practice in British political scandals, this is not particularly picky.
There seems to be no order to be sold, no accounts in the Paris hotel have been paid in favor of payment, no foreign fingerprints have been paid.
But the barbaric Gordon Brown would have gone without it being shown that a wealthy businessman would mask contributions to the government's labor force at a rate of 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) on behalf of other people, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister abstained from voting and challenged the British intelligence by claiming that this decision had not been affected by research, there was hope that he would ensure a sound and effective government.
Instead of expressing it as the more impressive representative president of the Liberal Democrats, Mr. Brown has changed his mind from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The neutral rescue of Northern Rock's problem banks showed weaknesses in handling and poor judgment under the deck.
Wrongly planned proposals for a change of tax law were linked by companies against the government.
The loss of personal data by 25 million people has left unrepresentable administrative care.
Three of the generals in the pensions withdrew their opposition to the trade lords; they protested against the massacres in military spending because they claimed that being the leader of the armed forces was a part of the work.
Now there are several gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the general secretary of the workers (and their former internal discipline overseer), has already refused.
It doesn't mean that Mr. Brown would never turn back to his end.
Even so, governments can reach the point of overlap that they are looking for difficult governance.
People don't believe politicians and they don't like them, but most of them take away their mistrust when we take over a new party.
Once it seems clear that some Prime Minister is probably not doing anything better and must not be in the office for a long time, this is being withdrawn away: state administration becomes a hero, ministers start to do briefing, the press is looking for bad news and the government becomes uninterrupted and defensive.
In one direction, Mr Brown's position is particularly complex because it is not possible for other political leaders to take the position of the new cost.
If he'd like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he'd be his first agent.
For example, problems with Northern Rock and financial authority records are linked to decisions made by Mr Brown as Minister of Finance.
And even though he was not directly involved in the brairovish minors, for example, long-term investigation of funding of political parties affected by "money worth," voters can easily assume that he was.
But Mr. Brown's not as bad as they look.
These concepts are not as complex as the conservatives do.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died or was exposed.
And the treatment, whatever it may be, is to provide what the Stalinist trend Mr. Browna has always promised: reliable, stable and easy for the brutal government.
The latest traffic around political gifts is a good example.
Mr. Garboids, who compares his gifts with the charity, says he didn't want any publicity for his welfare.
That might be true, but the decision wasn't on him.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and there is a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those in the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abraham's procedure, but he didn't know that he was illegal, will certainly be heard properly; so will John Mendlesohn, the main labist treasurer who learned about the outstanding gifts in October.
But Mr Brown is not yet quite busy; there's nothing that would mean he knew about these wars, even though the main part of the payment went on until after he arrived in June.
The Prime Minister's already done half the job.
He quickly condemned this violation of the laws by his own party, but resolved his decision that he had obtained a certified instrument, the Commission to investigate this matter - led further by the bishop in debt and the judge.
In this case, there are no difficulties in teaching.
If the law has been violated, it's a matter of police concern.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent independent committee on Standards in Public Life, which has no one in six months or more, and taking on a real reform of the financing of political parties.
This would require employers who are in debt to cooperate with conservatives and almost have given up their special financial relationship with committees - hot pills for a given party, which is Mr Brown.
But he should face some simple facts.
Conservatives now have a good chance in research; he's two years old to get back to the vote; and the only way to win is to be honest and highly competent.
Carrots
Does the crisis affect the same mortgages of the American credit card market?
When it's in the water, it's naturally starting to mix the red river around.
When the American market with properties is now rigid, the traitors focused on the darker market of credit cards.
Goldman Sachs' analysts say that losses on credit cards would result if there were other consumer credit options from similar mortgages, they could achieve $99 billion.
The pressure marks are visible.
An increase in the number of cases of non-payment (at more than 30-day late payment) and the accounts recorded (accounts considered by the supplier to be inexhaustible).
HSBC reported last month that US consumer credit market losses of $1.4 billion - also due to unsolved loans on credit cards.
But it's still too early to panic.
There are still a few accounts and paybacks that are still low.
According to the Moody's assessment agency, 3,89% of the payment capacity in the third quarter was almost the total percentage point below average.
In part, there are technical reasons why there is an increase in the number of conflicts.
The changes in American personal banking laws since 2005 have led to a sudden decline in the number of reported banknotes that make a large part of the loss of credit cards; the number of reports (and, therefore, the number of letters) would therefore be based on the fact that the general conditions for the lenders have deteriorated.
The company also shows a good level of pay which shows how many consumers per month pay their debts.
And trust in valuable paper of secured credit cards is strong, despite the paralysis of other structurally structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup research company predicts that their emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than electricity.
Direct routes for the spread of infection between the crisis of similar mortgages and the market of credit cards are crucial: when credit cards are raised in real estate, consumers are more indebted to credit cards.
Credit card issuers are increasingly looking at cash flow rather than the value of handicrafts, so the falling prices of the home should not necessarily mean a change in the reliability of the lenders.
They can even be useful for the suppliers of the loan.
The reason for consumers to pay mortgages is when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, debt on cards is raised on the list of priorities for payment.
The issuer of the card will also be able to respond faster and more flexiblely to the hotter conditions than the provider's mortgage by changing the rate or limits of debt.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid changes in the prices of handicrafts.
"It's not gonna happen that we'd just overestimate all the loans one good morning," says Gary Perlin, financial manager of Capital One.
Although the risk of explosion in the style of similar hypotheses is low, the risk of gradual deterioration is much more real.
If the lower prices of home and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card sector will be facing a darker future.
Look out for those red rivers.
British bankers admitted the blame for Enron
Three British bankers who were supposed to be linked to their role in the dispute with former financial manager Enron Andrew Fastowe, changed their statements and admitted their guilt.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally guilty of seven cases of subpoena when they had to share with Fastowe in 2000 in the financial subsector -- to be enriched in the account of their employees -- they were fired.
They were supposed to sit in front of the court.
However, during the trial before U.S. District Judge Ewinge Werline Jr., everyone admitted to one trial.
The case of these three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, has been listed on front pages throughout the two years that have been running.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed part of the investigation initiated after the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charge against him in 2002 warned Mr Fastow that he was the aim of the government investigation regarding the small Enron.
The complaint against bankers -- who have served as a review of the "NatWest Three" -- claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to reopen their business with Fastowe and his ex-chief partner Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's partnership area controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of many Enron's substations that were following Enron's spiral towards the banknote.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank assessed its share in this area as zero, but our three British knew that it really had a significant value.
The company under Kopper's control bought part of the bank in this area for $1 million.
Incriminating bankers paid Kopper for a share in this company of $250,000.
According to Fastow's complaint, Enron falsely reported that the energy company would pay for its share in this part of Greenwich NatWest.
In fact, all those 20 million went to those British bankers, Fastoov and others.
Bankers received a claim of 7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper and others improved for $112.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow admitted his guilt in two cases for his role in Enron’s trial.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving six-year sentence in the federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is in prison for three years and one month in a facility in Texas.
All three Britons moved to freedom at $1 million, which ordered them to stay in the United States for the trial to come.
Enron, the seventh largest company in the country, settled into the banknote in December 2001, after which it was no longer possible to hide billions of debts after years of accounting tricks or to show a growing speculation as profits.
The merger has broken down thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and former chief executive officer Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year to their role in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is in operation more than four thousand-year-old punishment.
The trials over Laye for poisoning, poisoning and other charges were reduced after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow’s Non-Power
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with Rolls-Royce engine and with enough fuel for nonstop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, it's too small to pay back.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of the Gulfstream.
"But none of them is interested in such a place because it's for the family or the company president."
Mr. Firer sat in the Gulfstream station last Friday at the Millionaire exhibition, which is a four-day consumable organ at the motherly exhibition centre on the main city's perimeter.
In addition to the Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers have set up their stations, who have hoped that the very rich Russians will draw on all of the mahogany jackets that have been made after diamonds that have been turned into cars that would not be ashamed of even 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looked closely after the orange Porsche in the back yard.
"It's a nice car, but it's five and ten against us," he said.
"In the United States, Russia is the second largest private airline market."
In the streets of the Russian capital, money is saved just as if Dallas had his days.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans became rich and went to Europe where they looked like materialism," said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year-old listener at Davis's centre of Russian and European studies at Harvard.
Like the southern miners from the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russia is becoming the most prominent world loser.
The most exclusive luxury characters are looking for this Klondike's work.
In another place in Moscow this week, the conference of the luxury industry Donatallu Versace, Tom Forda and Bernarda Arnaulta, led the LVMH Group to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods on markets such as the Russian.
(The Conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which owns The New York Times Company.)
Russia has a list of the richest people for Forbes 53 billionaires with a total of $282 billion.
In addition, the local institute of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research has issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103 000 "secondary" millionaires in Russia whose assets amount to $670 billion.
(The World Bank notes that in 2005 there were 15.8% of Russians living within the limits of the existing minimum.)
"In Moscow there are hundreds of millions -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of the London colony of David Morris.
She was at the market for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this sign, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are completely adjusted, and men are all for the whole name."
When they went through evening shifts on Sunday evenings, 11-year-old Evgenia Yumatov and five-year-old Lightlan Turovovov himself and his clients marked themselves and their clients for millions.
"I looked at this car and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatov, who was wearing a distinctive dress as the veteran of the red cubes, where Joan Rivers looks like a homecoming.
Veletrh seemed to focus mainly on pure rich people, markedly controlled Russian buyers who are willing to sit for several hours in the road to walk through the warehouses that circling Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fish, Movöenpick ice cream, Christmas table for peace, apartments in Dubai, Gund swimming and swimming pools.
Members could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in what is the most precious and best sign," said Mr. Gijrath, who inherited the state of the Dutch producer Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt's image from hand-made blue cotton in a magnificent size.
"Of course the Russians are more interested in lunch."
And as a result, salesmen say that Russians with old money (according to Russian measurements are 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from blizzard logs to a few well-known limited editions that would never show up on the market.
Even a few thousand people, whether they are millions of people, millions of people, or just tourists, every day the world’s shopping malls are flooded.
And some of them bought it.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershaw, the local manager sent King Koil to sell two matrac fruit from furniture, cassamery and cotton, covered with gold jewelry, after $70,000.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, the sales manager of A1 Moto, who is providing high-end high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company sold a clear orange Porsche for $170,000 for Russian million.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, who is expected to manage a luxury car, said that he sold three lines into a car in the style of a shared network for Rolls-Royce Phantom after $55,000.
He showed the reporters around the car designed for the Russian casino owner who had an excavated Swarovski crystal that looked like a roller.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
"This Russian millionaire who wants a car from a fur or a portrait of his wife from a cross-circuit circus should not drive on these wheels yet," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He puts them in his garage about thirty to forty cars."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" at present does not mean anything very exclusive, given the large increase in prices of older properties.
"If you bought three or four years ago to live in Moscow, you're probably already millions, at least on paper when you're no longer ready," he said.
"There's more to them than you think."
Those who are not millions could at least predict wealth in the state of Russia's Alliance Continental company, which is run by active management.
The company drew up four red cell cells of British-styled fake banknote columns worth millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing manager of the company, reported that his team had issued 500 000 fake banknotes for Veletrh millionaires.
Contradictors were tempted to spread money around a collection of money or to let friends take off their cell phone as they rest in the middle of the reward wealth, or simply throw a few million caps out of their pockets.
"You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a million," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by an operation
It was the day before Christmas when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the restaurant about something better and followed the Sanitary, which came to a white New England house with two houses than after West Scott Avenue.
The police guard's car was on fire soon.
And then again.
"Then I saw the hand of a judge," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant inspector.
"At that time I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found out that Olga Arroya, 41 years old, was an executive assistant to the head of the non-war police department.
The investigators are now trying to determine whether she died due to the procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to grant, who worked at home at West Scott Avenue No. 212.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and they hope that toxicological tests, which should not be known for weeks, will help to solve the death of the suspect, which, under the guidance of the non-war police, has caused a wave of sadness.
Ms. Arroy was the assistant to the police chief, Gary F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, uplifted and hard-working," said Mr. McCarthy about Ms. Arroy's phone interview in the middle.
"It was my protection.
She'd protect me."
Mr. McCarthy pointed out that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former non-war police officer who works for the Commission for the Control of Alcoholic Drinks, and that she left behind two sons at age 14 and 11 and her own daughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for the Union's national representative, Theodore J. Romankova, said that Detectives are trying to find out whether Ms. Arroy died of unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"The investigation is still underway."
The authorities reported that the storm had reached home at three o'clock in the afternoon. 21 o'clock.
November and found Ms. Arroyo at the shelter.
She was on the spot declared dead.
More than a week later, the authorities continued to say little about their research or about the owner of the house, probably Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't say if the authorities heard of Miss Castro.
The investigators are trying to determine whether the part of the house was used as an office.
In the middle of Miss Castro's house, with a broken pink box in the front yard and a Dalmatian walking back, no one answered.
According to the door that led to the conclusion, a blue barl in an open garage with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" - which is a substance used as a substitute for the wool in food and cosmetics.
On the one side, there were two mountain cars.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in New York's police department 25 years later in New York City, Ms. Arroyo provided him with invaluable assistance in testing his new city's hateful and vicious political culture.
"She said, 'You should pay attention to this or this," he said.
"She was always here when I came, and she was always here when I left.
It was stupid."
It is hoped that Fed will reduce the rate of inflation, leading to the strengthening of the world's burgeoning winds
The stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic fell yesterday after the market hope that the Federal Bank is trying to calm down the loan conditions by further lowering the rates, were strengthened by the relaxing products of the US Central Bank.
Burzy jumped in London, New York, and above Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line with Ben Bernanek, President of Fedu, said that in response to the continued pressure on financial markets there must be "flexible and pragmatic" drivers.
In a clear effort to calm the fragmented market between the signs of life-saving credit, Mr Kohn said that recent developments "particularly resulted in some improvements in the functioning of the markets at the end of the September and October".
He further pointed out that if increased instability persists, the possibility of financial conditions of households and companies getting worse.
Investors consider these products to be a signal that Fed is ready to add to the US market other net capital doses, and perhaps further lowering rates to stabilize credit conditions.
These notes also helped calm Wall Street among other bad news about the American economy when the sale of apartments in October showed a record of low numbers.
The results of the financial credit were supported by the announcement by the Investment Bank Bear Stearns that it will abolish 650 jobs, 4% of which are its world labour force, in the context of the reduction of costs due to the compensation of serious losses caused by the unreported share of the grant of similar loans to housing in America.
It is expected that only 20 of these places will be dissolved in London where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York the industrial index Down Jones grew by 331 points, or 2.55 per cent, and closed at 13,289.40, while the more used index S&P 500 increased by 2.65 per cent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 per cent, and closed to 6,306.2, with the value of British blue chips rising by over 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index grew by 2.6 per cent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 per cent.
A short time ago, the credit pressure on the markets was shown in full force after the European Central Bank’s three-month cash package auctions were awarded to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7 %, which is the largest since December 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and issue over-standard money on the London money market increased by increasing the rate of three-month British inter-bank loans "Libor" after an uninterrupted increase from 12 November to a maximum since the end of September - 6.59 per cent.
England has to decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas here, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who's gonna be the number six in England this weekend in Candy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context of nothing less relevant than the first test against Sri Lance, who has to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the committee's selection committee, which is held to be more favourable at this time of borrowing, has Peter Moores, the Chief Trainer, and Michael Waughan, the Captain, with the decision to assist and because the board of Hugh Morris, the lead manager of the English team, begins to fill in applications at the national election post, so that they do not need to be fully informed.
One who's not going to be set up in six places on the throne will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sports is not at all.
It is not easy to find out what one will get at the top of his profession, while someone else will never get over the lower level, sometimes because of lack of happiness more than ability.
Not only in the cricket is the choice of order and requires a judgment that must always be subjective.
Is it time for Bobara to move up?
It's fair to Shah, right?
At the same time, we could ask ourselves, in another area, to say that here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young leading staff with good education and field oversight, should be raised to the Commission - place is only for one.
Who should say what level is right for cricketers if he doesn't have a chance to swim or swim on the other side?
Of course, they have figures for decision-making, but they also have opportunities.
In the team, the cricket must capture the captain's view at the right time if he has to take a wicket, and the packer needs a regular chance at starting positions, if he ever has to make an opinion as a single cricket.
Taking a look at the speaker is more complicated.
For example, in the London season there was much better than James Anderson, whose place in the first test seems to be certain, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and challenged as a worker.
Anderson took 32 wickets in the first class at the 33 pass on each.
Chris Tremlett took the same dark average, but they both had their time at the highest level and hoped in another.
If he's playing at the Asgiria Shah stadium, or Bopara can only be an observation thing.
The choice may develop or get a career both, or it doesn't have a major impact either.
Four years ago, in Syria Lance played Garreth Batty in each test and in the first class gave good performance, five weeks and 40 permits, but it was Paul Collingwood who at the same time fought his place, who eventually became a stable test critic, which is more than that, although in Australia he recorded twice a hundred points, perhaps still undervalued.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion of the fact that today's training course will follow their conservative instincts and give Shah's greater experience before Bopar's youth rebellion.
There are arguments for both.
For Shaha, he speaks his sharp and valuable debut test exchanges on 88 points in Bombaji and 32 percent in the first grade of six Boparovs, which is, in twenty years, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spinal cord.
However, Shah did two shifts in May against the Caribbean in the Lord's Test, his domestic game in Middlesex, just ten moves, and that, along with the immediate refusal of the elections, when Vaughan wanted to re-locate him to another game, his withdrawal seemed to have been removed from the elephant that was so evident in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essical University has the joy of living in the bones.
At the cricket game, he is not distracted and his behavior outside the game symbolizes a recently converted car with a wear on four cars on the exhibition day of the English team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He brought his Vadaphone (of course also sponsored) with slight injuries and quite shocking shock, but as the first thing he pulled out of his Vodafone and called Alastair Cook, his partner who would tell him to ask him excitedly, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, its average fast comical tops on the walls that seem to him to get out of it, effectively dissolves and burns himself and handy.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe it's just the real art of the choice.
I personally turn my back on Bopar's chance now, which I don't want to say is that Shah won't be great if, as cello tea leaves indicate, it's who's gonna play next week.
Buses bring the fugitives back to work - and to fight against al-Qaida
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday and to excavate the refugees who had arrived or spent the visa period, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the weapons that escaped them from their homes.
The mansurous bus station was already before 800 people from Damascus arrived in the official government war on bus flows, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned from private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaysi, Sunni doctor.
"I'm back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspapers about what was done in Baghdad and how it's safe now.
"They say Mahdhi's army has stopped killing people," he said, bearing in mind the Shiite army of the military spiritual Muktady al-Sadra who ordered his people to stop fighting.
Kasim al-Atwani, an eight-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amariya, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew the Syrian visa and because the darker regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His jealous neighbors in Syria called on him to help the local home with the support of the American army to expel al-Qaida from its position in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribes, who from his home in Sleigh in northern Baghdad avoided a grenade attack after he urged his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"In the course of the morning a few friends called me and told me that they were going to Sleigh's military against al-Qaeda and that they needed me and the support of my men.
That's why I came back today," said twenty-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeid.
Many talked about the involvement of the rest in the capital after the strengthening of American military presence and the growth of local "groups of citizens involved", which are armed by the American army to defend their quarter.
But it was more about the return of the ban on visas and the death of money in Damascus, where over 1.3 million Iraqis have been attacked in recent years.
Salaam al-Samaraj, a 13-year-old father of three children, voiced the suspicion shared between refugees that Núri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to restrict the visa of refugees and so on.
According to the available data, more than two and a half million people were killed in the Iraqi sector.
"It was all right before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressed on the government to stop giving the Iraqis visas to have to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't believe the government that supports the criminals who burned me after my departure from the house."
Part of the reason for the weakening of violence is the fact that the Sunni were driven out of the coastal areas and on the contrary, which in many places reduces stress.
Concerns are expressed that the sudden flow of refugees back into the sectoral tension will slow down and lead to another battle.
Small Sarasko, good education
Germany's least social country plays a leading role in vocational education, and it is even superior to the international focus of its high schools.
In just one educational area, Sarska is concerned about the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"A man who doesn't leave Sri Lanka yesterday I explained after 50 years that we are no French" - this sebieronic password appears on the payments for the 50th anniversary of the birth of this least common country.
In addition, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Irish education system, which plays a major role in monitoring the study of the Colinian Institute for Economic Research (IW) in the fifth place.
High schools are thus traditionally co-operated with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 in France.
To date, students can complete the study by two or even three degrees.
This corresponds to a fairly high proportion of foreign students who make 15.6%.
Of course, an excessive number of breastfeeding children are admitted to high school - many of them even without a university degree.
"In Sardinia, a professional education system is being used," says Axel Plünnecke, educational expert IW.
Because more than every fifth young person is entitled to study at a professional school, Serbia is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared with the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Sardinia to combine practical and academic education.
The opportunity to study two camps is given the number of the second best citizens throughout Germany.
Through practical training and ongoing demand, the number of graduates of engineering over the last few years has increased.
Therefore, the Hungarian Ministry of Education has now ordered a high school to create a propaganda campaign on engineering teams.
"After the first study of the Scriptures, we conducted several reforms at schools in general," says the Ministry of Education.
The government therefore conducted comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as early as possible, the last year of maternity schools is free - a model that is also transferred to other partner countries.
If the results of the needles are significantly better, they will show up the next comparative study.
In the course of the Pisa study in 2003, the risk weights decreased from 29 to 20 %.
However, Sarska has not improved as much as other social countries.
Barrows can count better.
And to break up Sarska's study of the Scriptures does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - in the wrong case, Sarska could be directly affected in this area.
The language of the neighbours is still mandatory in the Gymnasies - even though the citizens of Sárska are not French.
Key to move E
What they don't see is going to be in Venezuela for hours other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez will be allowed to spend half an hour in this South American country.
In Spain there is a funny figure between Chavez and Chavez.
The official Venezuelan letter reported that the hours will be reduced by at least four and a half hours under the new World War II.
The South American state will be this step in the time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Chávez, an enemy of the United States, justified his decision by inter alia that the United States had entered into the world’s distribution of time stamps after all hours.
In the middle of the local time, Chávez further announced that due to the causes of handcuffs, he was breaking up relations with the neighboring Colombia.
This left-wing nationalist has declared that while conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, there will be no relationship with him or with the Colombian government.
"I can no longer vote for myself," said Chávez, who is promulgating the reform of the Constitution by which this poor country must vote in the Sunday referendum.
This reform would greatly strengthen Chavez's power in the country.
Hadku has chosen Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's credit to join the Marxist Revolution in Colombia.
The Uribs by their decision Venezuela "flyed face", criticised the Uribe Chavez Sunday.
And in Spain, everyone's talking about Chavez.
A new mobile call here called "Why don't you call" (Why aren't you quiet?) - so it sounds like more than half a million people got out of the Internet.
It was expressed by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who, at a recent Ibero-American summit of the top of the attention of this leviathan populist, was so shocked by his silence.
Germans in 2007 are at risk of lower payments
According to the forecast, this year Germany's employees are at risk of reducing realism even through strong convulsions.
Experts have explained their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to Nadace Hans Böckler, in 2007, employment can really be counted by getting lower wages than in the long year.
"The wine brings small increases in wages, increases in tax from added value and increases in prices for food and energy," said the IMC Research Institute (Institut für Makroukonomie und Konjunkturforschung).
New employment problems may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the New Osnabrücker Zeitung that by the new year, the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the company's work agency should no longer fall into such a threat that it would have to demand loans or contributions from the company's youth, citing the news of this social democratic policy.
On Tuesday it was published that the price explosion of food and raw products prevented inflation on its highest level in the last thirty years.
In the annual comparison of prices, the total price rose by three per cent.
Venus is the Hellen Two-Sided Earth
During his life as an enemy, Venus Earth is more similar than ever before. The European Space probe Venus Express in Venice has noted the lakes that occur in the winter on Earth: mud in the atmosphere and wind in the fields.
For nearly three decades, scientists have dreamed that it's blushing in Venice.
Now the European probe Venus Express has brought proof - it has caught electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. In Venice, clouds from dark to dark are flying up to about 56 kilometers high, wrote in the natural Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles.
According to the famous theory of the origin of lead weights, the Earth was able to produce life by lightnings. Boroughs probably resulted in ocean reactions that led to the origin of amino acids, the basic stones of life.
There was no such thing in Venice: "If there had ever been life there, it must have been a long time," explains Sean Solomon of Carnegie University in Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus, there is a living room. The atmosphere is about twice as thick as the earth and sometimes there are temperatures about 500 °C.
"It's probably a double Earth, but it's a double," said Russell.
Why has Venus, which is the Earth of weight and size so similar, started to develop completely different, is the basic question of Esa's mission.
In view of the fact that since the beginning of the 1990s no probe has been sent exclusively for the study of Venus, the beginning of the Venus Express was in November 2005 in search of this planet.
According to scientists, the latest research, which approached several articles in the journal Nature, did not highlight only the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"It has also been shown that our neighbouring planet is more like Earth than ever before," said Esa.
Besides the already known windmills in the north, scientists have found a dark faith in the south that is much faster.
This phenomenon recalls air raids on the northern part of the country, writes a research team led by Giuseppe Picioni of the Italian Institute of Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second most internal planet of our solar system creates almost the same weight as Earth and with an average of 12 100 km is almost the same size.
This planet is marked as the Night of the Sun for 225 days.
However, around its own axis it returns much less. One day in Venice, it lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venuše’s surface temperature is not mentioned at 460 °C and the pressure of 92 bars Earth, scientists are aware that both planets have given rise to very similar conditions.
The water was collected on both sides, but the earth remained in the oceans, while the universe was being formed from Venice.
While carbon dioxide is absorbed on Earth, most of the atmosphere is formed in Venice.
Köhler calls for a meeting of Merkel with dalailam
Co-President Köhler calls for the end of the party's disputes because of the adoption of a delay in the office.
SPD did not directly criticise her attacks on the office after her meeting in September.
Co-President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's history and calls for a great coalition to end its fight against dalailam.
"We should not be presenting ourselves as a nation which is not united on this issue," Köhler told the economic news Storesblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the decision of the German Chancellor Angely Merkel (CDU) to adopt the dalailam in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universality for me," Köhler said.
The Co-Chair stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain reasonable balance in foreign policy, but it did not prevent Merkel from stopping when it was read that he is creating a new policy against China.
"The National Chancellor didn't leave China's traditional policy.
China knows that too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) gave his immediate agreement with the adoption of the deadlines, and he was attacked by a number of coalitions.
Steinmeier also complained about the "pretty" foreign policy of the coalition.
Following the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Office of the Chancellor, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of the German Finance Minister Peera Steinbrück (SPD), but according to the SPIEGEL magazine, it also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of foreign ministers.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on the Chancellor of Angel Merkel to admit that the adoption of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China disagrees when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
The words and deeds of Dalai Lama showed that Tibet is trying to separate from China along with other Tibetan areas that are also located in China.
Schäuble protects against similar disturbances that have emerged in France
Halfway fights with the police, shootings, burned cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar disturbances that have emerged in France.
We must do everything to ensure that social unrest in Germany does not increase in street violence, the Minister of the Interior calls for it.
Baricadas were burned, protesters shot at police broccoons. After serious disturbing young people in France, the joint minister inside Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) was afraid of similar developments in Germany.
"We must be careful not to create such social pressures that are due to violence as well.
We have to take this seriously," he said in the Hanoi Neue Presse newspaper.
Not every young person is able to cope with the rapid change in social reality.
Social government, countries and citizens are already working hard to solve problems, Schäuble said.
It's not just the integration of migrants.
"From the summit on integration after the Islamic Conference we note the first success."
However, transparency is still in place.
Schäuble at the same time pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of the French.
In the past few nights, youth and police forces in the northern suburbs of Paris were engaged in a hard street fight.
And in Toulouse she burned cars and public buildings.
More integration efforts were required by the German government by the President of the Turkish Town in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the turmoil in France, he warned Kolat against "a similar effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
However, it should be done.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 years of age who come from immigrant families, unemployment is "promely high".
In particular, there is a need to ensure a greater number of study opportunities.
Kolat stressed, "We have to give young people hope."
The Turkish mayor added, however, that there is more social control of the family in Germany than in France.
In addition to many young immigrants, he does not want to destroy what his parents have built here.
He said, "Be straight, but we have to pay attention."
We've got to get young people to start working and learn.
In the meantime, she stayed at the Paris port of Villaries-le-Bel quite calm.
There were hundreds of police officers in the camp, and over the area there was a helicopter with lights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests and several burned waste bones and cars.
Since yesterday, about 1,000 organized forces have been in charge of rest.
The police will take as long as it is necessary to notify the Ministry of Interior of Michelle Alliot-Marie after the visit.
In the restrooms at the Villaries-le-Bel, about 80 police officers were injured on Tuesday night.
The next night, Toulouse was caught in trouble.
Disorders have led to an ongoing traffic accident involving two young people.
According to the original findings of state representation, the police carry no blame for the death of young people.
In the "Oblak" section of Angely
Cancleric's real remote output confirms that the coalition is programmed at the end and that we can no longer expect anything more from it.
In what country does this office actually live?
After its unsatisfied, relentlessly exhilarating and very poor performance in the general debate on the Social Network we must note: not here - not in this country where it should end up.
It appears that he is too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel once responded to a very arrogant world.
It's a provincial she said she didn't want to understand what critics are talking about.
In the Colosseum she showed everyone clearly how much she deserves this reading.
From Merkel, he had no real interest in any problem in the country.
Instead, Angela "Oblakov" was presented: a politician who is responsible for others who go into foreign politics and even express themselves mildly.
For example, climate protection: without stopping, it is praised for the conclusions from the summit in Heiligendam, but it is no longer saying how the climate goals are to be achieved in Germany.
And in fact, this kind of behavior - so embarrassing that President CDU would have let go two years ago.
Now it's limited to a plan of words that could increase the gap between people.
This approach damages its pragmatic image, which doesn't need to be relieved because it solves problems.
But in the "Oblak" section of England, internal political problems are of extreme concern.
Child poverty and the care of people with low poverty?
She's been left with a few more questions.
It's worth noting how often Merkel is involved in child care.
Mercel has to start three times from the beginning in order to be able to express at least partially the right way.
As soon as things start to be very concrete, it's stuck like in a very foreign field.
Breakdown of exit
The debate of the Republican presidential candidates at Youtube has opened up in favor of Rudy Giuliani and Mitta Romney - and they must now fear an outside candidate.
The pressure of both candidates is already on the first topic.
Mitt Romney tells his opponent Rudy Guilianian that he made "a refuge for illegal immigrants" from New York.
Giuliani is quick to respond to severe criticism: "I think his own house was just one such attack," he answers and gives the former Governor Massachusetts the impression that he was privately employed by immigrants without evidence.
In view of the fact that the Republican foundation still has no clear preference, eight presidential candidates use these CNN debates mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute, Internet users are affected and via Youtube sent videos serve only as such key topics.
"This is exactly the political isolationism we have enabled Hitler to gain power," John McCain gives his opponent Ron Paula, who as the only one is promulgating the immediate withdrawal of the army from Iraq.
Vietnam's veteran McCain doesn't care about either Romney or Romney because he refuses to condemn the torture method called Waterboarding, where the heat is symbolized.
The public's reactions in the Florida St. Petersburg show that among the important issues of the campaign, there is no war in Iraq or methods of torture.
The promise is called into question whenever conservation values are praised and future tax increases are refused.
It'll show you where the weaknesses are both.
"I've been wrong this time," explains Romney's misunderstanding and asks for a foreign basis and a TV release because he was still a customer in 1994.
Giuliani is in trouble when it comes to the Scriptural explanation of the Bible.
Musharaf First Government in Civil
On the day after his resignation from the position of the superior army commander, Pakistani Governor Musharaf made the presidential pledge.
That's when the eight-year military government in Pakistan ends.
The President of Pakistan, Parviz Musharaf, made a presidential pledge on Thursday, which he holds in the presidential office for the next five years.
Pakistan's television has transferred the life of a ceremony that took place in the presidential palace in the capital city of Islamabad.
The Musharif swore he would respect the constitution and force the good people.
In the middle of his senior army officer's office, he handed over his trust to Ashfaq Kiyan, who was under international pressure, particularly from the United States.
Eight years after the power was gained in the bloodless military revolution, the former general first as head of the state.
As a result of the withdrawal from the position of the Chief Armed Forces, Musharaf met one of the main requirements of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the exceptional status expressed by Musharaf on 3 November.
According to the senior state representative of Malik Muhammad Qayyuma, Musharaf will now withdraw an exceptional status after his accession and thus meet the requirements of the West.
The highest court of the country, which, following the announcement of the exceptional status at the beginning of November, had contained its cited lawyers, rejected all objections to the re-election of the head of state on 6 October last week.
In the meantime, five Vaziristan soldiers were killed during an attack on a military war in a tribal area and four others were injured.
The speech army reported that the bomb exploded on the road near the border with Afghanistan.
The father's shorts are coming back
The famous German group of seventy years is playing again. Three Harmonian groups re-enacted their electronic synthesisers at the Berlin concert.
Revival will also include Live 1974, sisters from the most successful capel period.
They've already been significantly more prominent abroad.
The announced sense then begins with the appearance of three seated gentlemen who at first seem to be just having dinner.
Everyone's got a tie, cables and buttons.
Thirty-nine-year-old Dieter Moebius was sitting in the snowy chair in the middle.
After his left, he's seventeen-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and a guitar.
Thirty-seventeen-year-old Hans-Joachim Rodelius, who is centrally leaning over the synthesiser, is from the perspective of the monsters right.
Everyone sings sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, I don't know, it's a tradition.
It doesn't seem like it's too bad for the singers.
Among the lovers, he briefly called for a revival of the chapel of Harmonia to be a significant blow.
One thing is worth noting. Repeated questions have shown that this name of the network is part of the collective knowledge of the pop, but it is certainly not so urgent that someone should have treated this capelel for twenty-three years.
But why couldn't Germany celebrate its still living legends in the 1970s?
And especially when it's a musical style, called a short truck, in England and in America, it's worth more than it's in its own country.
When in 2003, the music industry gave the rest of Cancho's Culinary Group an echo price for life, the hall was full of dozens of views of German pops.
In addition, Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu groups for their show, the wonder of the monsters no longer knew the boundary.
Michael Rother was later at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concert with them sitting on the porch as their old friend.
The problem of homelessness and foreign love is one thing.
With the memory of Harmony’s chapel, we are overemphasized, the trio existed for only two years, and even at that time there was no such effect as they were later counted.
Moebius and Rodelius were already playing with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promised name of Cluster.
They started playing at the Berlin theater of Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons at the gramphone firm, the church led.
Rutherford briefly helped the Kraftwerk group, but he received the story as a guitarist at the New! chapel, which at that time may have been the most traditional German group.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the Capely Cluster to the Exile in Forst and Weserbergland.
There, in Old Weserhof, the 16th - century ruin, they lived as members of the community who escaped the city.
They didn't live here as idealistic as in Communist I, where Rodelius was still supposed to steal like a cow.
It was a better life in such an artistic life.
The name for this art is probably derived from the name of the song congregation of Harmony Ottenstein, whose record was probably found in the library.
A lot of that harmony has been observed.
The first album was called "Hudba from Harmony" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music was so quiet and modest, the capillary suffered from financial problems.
The collection of growth did not serve only for self - recognition.
The "Live 1974" CD was currently released at the concert in Griessem before the record of a small, almost ten-member concert.
This time, Rothera expressed his hope that the members of Harmony would get better and more likely to enjoy themselves.
For Rodlia and Moebia, it was a very disobedient request.
In 1975 the chapel announced its release.
He ended up in an esoteric sphere, and he made his future secure by the album "The Hot Heart".
Capela Cluster lived again in the 1980s and has been more successful since then than Harmonia had ever been.
For live album from Griessemer, we can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His recording company Grönland took it for a short walk to see as a original German contribution to live music.
Chapel Neu! was considered Rodel's solo work at that time.
The body resurrection of Harmony will take place in the Berlin House of World Culture.
The event under the Voldtronics festival will be publicly sponsored.
He'll be next to Brit, Julian Cope, old banker and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
Also involved is the founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
That's what we've been planning to do with a whole range of short-term effects on future pop music.
The empty place of the celebrity group will be filled with harmony.
The Briana En, delivered by these most wonderful sounds, is known in the hall: "The only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are images on which the producer with Harmony is in the agricultural seat.
It also contributes to the creation of legends and to the promotion of other black photographs on which the seeds of wild devices are attached cables.
In the past, the three veterans were again employed for improvisation.
I'm no longer looking at microphones on the walls and drums to make these tools come out of the unheard-tones.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the point-in-the-frequency technique.
There's nothing changing about the World's House of Culture.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, under the sounds of the hat and in one beautiful place, he sings "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Krautrock was always a very English idea.
It's never been about rock.
The roots would be more than found in the blues in the music schools (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in the run before the art and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever calls this place '68!' is not so far away from the truth, but Harmonia is not even allowed to get out of it now.
And it's probably the most obvious thing to think about on the scene.
Where does the music start and when does it end?
This is a question whether a person is prepared for nerves or is prepared to cope with extreme moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
With the introduction of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two movies about the war in the Balkans appeared immediately.
But not one of them is convincing.
The presentation of films is either too much focus on action and shooting or too clever.
There's no such thing as Richard Gere's here at The Hunting Party.
The good news as the first: The Karadzic and Mladic criminal are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the southern part of the Bosnian War, here is Richard Gere.
We have recently lost this most beautiful man for eight decades, not only because he has played in many popular, trivial roles in traditional women's films, but in connection with his press conferences forever on the subject of Buddhism, he's going to have another movie with this hero.
And yet Richard Gere is one of the strongest arguments for following The Hunting Party - Where does the hunter become useful (Why should the names of movies be so long and confused today?).
Gere is doing so. His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically what Gere could become if the judge and the film industry were not so kind: a man who has his best years behind him for years, but as a few similar memories he still maintains a certain positive feeling.
But despite this storm, The Hunting Party is together with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also enters China this week, only by continuing an endless series of unsuccessful movies about the war in the Balkans.
With Mörderischer Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian girl from the Kosovo shooter, one of whom loves her.
While it is commendable that Serbs are not represented here as the cause of all evil, this television film is changing too quickly in shooting and action.
There's going to be something much like the Cobra 11 series that's going to stay out of the way, but it's war.
On The Hunting Party's film, you can look carefully at why it has not yet been able to find a really good film about the Balkan War.
The story of three U.S. military reporters who appear to be "Lick", a Serbian top war criminal, could be a new "Apocalypse" under the leadership of another director and scriptist (here is both Richard Shepard).
Both stories seem surprising: small groups go into the woods to do something that the army is not capable of, but their path will become a way of madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not that jealous and sentimental kinetic that was presented at the beginning.
On the contrary, the proposal also predicates a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The Hunting Party film can finally be described after reporting to reporters in the last five minutes of the film what NATO, the CIA and all the world's criminals in the last five years have not been told: to capture the crime and leave it to justice for Bosnian Muslims.
It's so against the logic of film creation that it could still be referred to the International Court of Justice in Haagu.
This movie has a deep human message.
It argues that Karadzic and Mladic are still free and suspects Americans and Francoise (they are extremely united) that on the basis of secret political agreements, they do not believe that they are being pursued sufficiently intensively.
But the good and the bad are sometimes so similar, the woman who attacks us celebrates Brecht's pool.
It refers to the wooden mask of the Asian demon at the work desk of the writer: "I feel like I'm looking at the quicksands on my head, a sign: how it's intended to be evil."
In movies such as The Hunting Party, they present exactly such tired heads, but they point out how intentional it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the subject of the war in the Balkans.
Recently it was written in these newspapers that all Hollywood films about Iraq were very unsuccessful.
It can be added only: No good film about South Africa has yet been posted.
Almost always pays: When a star falls across the crisis area or passes through the mine field, it creates a film such as Rangoon with Patricia Archette, Limite with Angelina Jolie or Bluddymanten with Leonard DiCapri.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close.
Finally, they had to run for ten years before Hollywood could find a good movie about Hollywood - Schindler's list.
Many films must obviously be viewed - movies that are considered classic Vietnamese today - "Lover of yelens", "Apocalypse" or "Oil-West" - were not celebrated in any case as mystical works.
But maybe today, when every mass murder occurs at home on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
The scriptists do not have this ability that is needed to fix the good news.
"Be or not" or "Great dictator" have become so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin have not yet known how the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe a man shouldn't want to be good when he wants to do good movies.
It may be necessary to create a saracasticly appropriate artistic view as romanticist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was caught in a parallel between his historical novel "Lemprier's dictionary" and "Balcan War," he declared: "The same thing is only about that things never change.
The cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible manner and the war in Yugoslavia will always be."
Von Beaust is critical of the elimination of the Olympics
Representing anxiety from the organisation of the annual Olympic Games in Hamburg has led to a prudent policy and economic crisis.
Many want to continue to fight for the water supply.
Von Beust, but he's trying to get realism in the way of chance.
The main director of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, in the middle, pointed out this decision "from the point of view of an unhappy business".
No other project has recently failed in the city with as much motivation as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, it would not be possible to maintain this sports political superpower so high."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to undermine this project, but created for it a new long-term concept, "which comes from an amended time plan."
The old Ole von Beaust remained in the middle of his earlier statements, which show that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are at least unrealistic by 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Association decides on the Olympic candidate," said von Beaust to the WorldT Online newspaper.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sports Union will decide on the Mnichov candidate for winter games in 2018.
"This preference for us means that we have no realistic chance with the 2028 time plan."
But this dream hasn't ended yet, von Beaust said.
The Hamburg Sports Union (HSB) marked von Beaustow’s products for policymaking.
It will be concluded that Hamburk does not want to be involved in organizing the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
"It is still too soon to destroy the chance that plans are already marked as dead in this early stage," HSB President Günter Plus said in the middle.
The conclusion would be in line with the statement by the Head of Senate, who went to the open-ended assembly of the German General High School Sports Association.
Von Beaust here presented the Hamburg candidate at the University in 2015 as a reward for organizing the Olympics.
In the past week, Hamburg’s high school sports club was nominated as a candidate city.
The SPD Group in the Hamburg Parliament stated that it is a valuable time that could be used to build houses in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area was the Senate for years, as it included the organization of Olympics and the building of apartments," SPD envoys Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook area continued to plan the Olympics with the later use of the whole area for the housing purposes, the CDU deliberately added "Olympian factor".
The 2012 season of the annual Olympic Games drew on its time in Hamburg with great excitement.
Hamburk, but he's lost his life in Lipska.
They're not Warhol's skulls.
The one who joins the Swedish and wooden beads doesn't think about Andy Warhol, but about Ike.
Or what?
Wooden beads currently made in Sweden are on the list of the part of the dark stone wall.
Most of it on the list of the 19th "Brill Box" types of Stockholm are fake.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" expressed doubts about the rights of the Warholov "Bryllo Boxes" in 1968, an internal research of the Museum of Modern Museet in Stockholm with a result of disappointment; six "Bryllo Boxes" awarded by the Museum of Modern Museet in 1995 by its former director Pontis Hultén are copies - like most of the other "Brill Boxes" type of Stockholm, which are on the international art market.
The previous events are complicated, manoeuvres of artistic and curatorial actions.
Warhol produced his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, reducing wood concrete, which was based on the red-mechanical design of the paper bags of Brillo.
The exhibition of his work at the Modern Museum in 1968 presented - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo baths from cardboard. They did not go (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from Brillo factory.
It wasn't about art, it was about their presentation, it was just the showcase.
Warhol was apparently granted permission in 1968 to produce several wooden Brillo beads in Sweden, but they are not displayed in the Modern Museum.
The most difficult witnesses are now talking about the fifteen bets that have recently entered the art and academic history as authorized sources - "Andy Warholovy Brillo Boxy" with the label Type Stockholm.
Some of them were executed on auctions for over $100,000.
The problem is now that the legendary director of the Pontius Hultén Museum later falsely claimed that in 1968 there was a production and exhibition in Sweden about a hundred bees who then left Warhol.
In fact, 105 Hultén's concretes were made in Malmö for the exhibition in Petrohrad for the first time in 1990.
Warhol was already three years after his death.
Lars Byström, top conservative Modern Museum, examined in addition to six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, three Brillo boxes from Swedish private collections, of which two were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their crossboards were painted in basic colour and painted, were made into a white colour.
However, from the structure of the 1990 copy it was discovered that the color was painted without the previous basic nature of painting directly on the crossboard - except for acrylic and not oil.
"This poor artist was not authorized and should be removed from Warhol's official Brilliant Boxes," said the director of Modern Museum, Lars Nittve: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to any other conclusion, the Modern Museum will have to classify six beads from its exhibition collections as "exhibital material - copy".
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that these "debt charges" that were raised in the case of scraps with metal dust would be destroyed.
But the organization is still in constant silence.
Rebellious Soldiers in Manila
In the Philippines there were rebel soldiers who were repatriated in one hotel in Manila and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The head of the rebels, Antonio Trillanes, who spoke about manipulation and corruption at elections, told the reporters at the hotel that he refused responsibility for bloodshed.
In the past, the government's soldiers had been forced to install solar currents at the hotel.
A few hours ago, about two tenths of the soldiers returned to the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood before the trial because of the measured attempt to reverse in 2003, including Trillanes.
The treatment was used to raise about 30 sympathetic people.
The soldiers who were supposed to watch him obviously ran over his side and joined the force.
They arrived at the Peninsula hotel and requested the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The government of loyal units closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president called for an urgent meeting of the security department.
The National Security Council of Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of soldiers.
"People already have enough," said Triallnes.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, head of former elite unit Scout Rangers, said that other military units will soon be joined.
Critics called on the government to act against the president of a great demonstration on Friday.
For months her government has been counting corruption.
The Manila financial area has already become the main centre of some 200 troops against Arroyo in 2003.
Because the rebels refused to join the army, they were forced to spend 24 hours a week.
Since 1986 at least seven times in the Philippines have tried to bring together a democratically elected government.
