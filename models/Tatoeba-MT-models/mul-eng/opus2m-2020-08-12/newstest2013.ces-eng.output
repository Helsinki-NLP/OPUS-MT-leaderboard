Strategy of the Republican Party against Obama's renewal
Republican leaders have justified their policy on the need to fight against voters.
However, Brennan's average of such a survey indicates that the pollutant is less common in the United States than the number of people who die after exposure to lightning.
In the last ten years, the Republicans have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States.
One thing is certain: this new provision will have a negative impact on voluntary participation.
In this sense, these measures are partly subject to the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, they are responsible for organizing federal elections of individual states in the United States.
And in this spirit, most American governments have since 2009 issued new laws that undermine the process of election or registration into the electoral list.
This year, after the elections in November 2010, 675 new Republican representatives arrived in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 legislative proposals were submitted for 2011 only in 41 countries.
New electoral laws require voters to provide evidence of identity with photographs and evidence of American state citizens.
In addition, these laws limit the period for elections in advance, exempt the right to register voters on the day of the election and take away the right to vote for citizens registered in the criminal register.
Before the elections in 2006, he did not require voters to present evidence of authenticity to the U.S. state.
The first state that made this requirement was Indiana.
The Constitution of the Indian Law confirmed in 2008 the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Republical authorities have been speeding up this process to other states.
In the last two years, proposals for such laws have been supported in 34 countries with a view to bringing together voters to present proof of identity from the photograph.
It should be noted that, unlike Quebec, there is no American public university certificate of identity, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, it does not own 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of age who are allowed to vote, no evidence of identity from the photograph issued by their government office.
There is no such evidence of identity for about five million new voters in 2012.
In addition, the required proof of authenticity is often more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are not limited to young people, members of the minority and persons with low income.
25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of people under $35,000; 18% of people aged 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 are therefore not required to demonstrate their identity.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as volunteers for their example of democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use their photo-based identity evidence.
On the other hand, the same Member States allow members of fishing or fishing clubs who prefer more Republican candidates to use the cards issued by these clubs in the elections.
By 2004, no state in favor of citizenship was required.
The first such request was made by Arizona.
Since 2011, about twelve states of laws have been adopted which lay down the duty of voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Spanish minority.
It is necessary to note, however, that two of the three Hispanic people are giving priority to the democratic side.
In 2011, the Republican legislators supported in eight states laws that violate the voter record on the day of the election.
They also limited the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to sign.
These restrictions have their consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, the polling campaign helped to record about 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted after 2009 however resulted in a fall in the registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% between 2006.
The Republican legislators then adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for elections in the next five states.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of African American voters voted in advance, although only 13% of African Americans voted in this country.
It was the same in Spain.
They created only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in front.
On the other hand, white people who represented 76% of all voters formed only 46% of the voters who voted in the show.
Against the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters, of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have become very prominent.
Democrats have blocked several legislative proposals in their own time.
In order to stop the application of the most controversial laws, the Attorney-General of the United States has even attacked the United States.
The damage they initially suffered was limited.
For example, the law requiring the presentation of proof of authenticity with the photograph was adopted by only 16 of the 34 countries.
However, the new rules introduced are inexhaustiblely difficult to implement voting rights in 2012.
The democratic criticism is mainly about the prevention of approved legislation and considers it a clear effort to influence the outcome of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 Brennan media report shows that the countries where these laws were adopted represent 171 out of 270 votes in the group of voters required for victory in presidential elections.
It is too soon to announce with confidence that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain today: this new provision will have an irrevocable impact on voluntary participation.
In this sense, these measures are partly subject to the US democratic system.
The detection of cancer of prostitutes: whether to complete the investigation or not?
The PSA test has led to slightly wrong results that were not correctly negative or even positive, leading to the remaining medical steps.
This has still increased the intensity of men who have already been so excited to go into the investigation.
Let yourself be examined or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
The studies conducted in the United States showed a high level of contamination among individual tested groups, so it is difficult to interpret these findings and make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a difference in mortality between patients who underwent examinations and those who did not.
This study also showed after 12-year absence that those who do not go to the study have between 30 and 40% higher risk of metastasis exposure.
So I'm recommending a 50-year-old or 40-year-old investigation if your direct visitor had cancer.
The most threatened group are also men of African American origin.
The key is to make the right decision when cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and types of cancer that are not accurate.
It is therefore necessary to properly explain to patients the level of risk of its type of cancer, to offer it possible alternatives, not to treat cancer without long-term life-threatening risks, and to focus on active control over disability in these cases.
Today, a number of men with cancer diagnosed are not treated because their cancer type is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We will suggest more active monitoring and, if we are unable to make progress, we will offer them treatment.
We are increasingly and more specific in setting criteria that help in deciding which kind of treatment and which are not.
Nevertheless, I recommend that the investigation be completed.
However, it is important to establish a dialogue with your doctor and determine whether an examination is appropriate.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, a Movember tool was created to evaluate for and against PSA research.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress made in the research, it seems to be the best means to reduce the risk of disease to adopt a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if everyone ate and moved sufficiently, up to 30% of cancer cases would occur.
"If everyone had stopped smoking, this data would have risen to at least 50%," supported André Beaulie, speaking Canadian cancer research companies.
On the contrary, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer disease causes addiction.
Some percentage remains completely unclear.
For the Canadian cancer research company, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even though the number of smokers is falling.
Cigarettes are 85% of cases of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
It's incredibly harmful to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million kids in Quebec today," wrote spokesman André Beaulie.
Upgrading data: 10 years after the smoke stops smoking, the risk of death from cancer of half.
Weight
Fatigue and obesity are another risk factor for the spread of disease according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fatty tissue and endocrine, iron, lead and particles.
"The research suggests that regular physical activity for the entire life of protection against the cancer of a fat stream," adds the report.
Exhibit
That organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too high can lead to increased risk of exposure to colorectal cancer.
It is appropriate to ensure that the loans for which it is paid are also paid.
Store in a refrigerator, drying or salting medium may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"They can cause damage to the liver of the organism and lead to cancer development," the report adds.
Vitamins
In recent times, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet brought a single conclusion.
Studies focused on vitamin E are dispersible according to SCC.
Although one of them says it will reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another study will talk more about its increase.
Not even the effect of vitamin D on cancer has been demonstrated.
Mr. Beaulie continues to focus on how important it is to talk about your concerns and your family's past with your doctor.
"Retailing the investigation doesn't mean you'll have cancer."
Higgs' Boson Researched
The notification of the likely discovery of Higgs' boson caused a wave in the summer of the correct outbreak.
There is a view that this boson is divided into a mechanism that is responsible for all mass in the universe.
And it's also about the last part whose existence presupposes a standard model - our best or "at least bad" explanation of behaviour and weight behavior - which has not yet been observed empirically.
However, physics still doesn't seem to be a percentage guarantee that it's Higgs' boson.
There is no doubt that we have a whole new part that is very similar to the Higgs Boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the great physical convention in Kyoto are more confirmed, but there is still a lack of data so that we can have absolute certainty.
However, let's assume it's about Higgs' Boson, because the risk of making a mistake is small, and let's look at what's really going on.
In this world there is a totally undisputed law that does not allow two things to be published at the same time in the same place.
This rule can't cover - and don't try too hard, otherwise you're hurting yourself.
Although partial physics is very strange in the world, it is shown that it also pays for the same law: Paul's exclusive principle that two parts cannot take the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quant state" - this "stand" is said to create some of their properties.
Next divides the physical parts into two categories.
On the one hand, we find organized citizens, or farmers who adhere to Paul’s principle.
And on the other hand, bosons are moving, under the anarchists who don't care about anything - definitely not the same principle, which means they can be at the same place at the same time.
These bosones are still divided into two groups according to the device (by simply amazing means), which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley laboratories: the masses we leave here without notice, and the "force parts", which are spread by the great natural forces and with which Higgs' boson is most likely in some way adapted.
It is necessary to say, however, that these bison are not as exotic animals as you might think.
If you read this article, it is thanks to the box with unusual banalite: photo, or "parts of the light", which is "carried" by electromagnetic forces.
When all the parts with an electric charge accelerate or change their direction, they "break" this electromagnetic field in this particular place, like the shape taken into the fishing vessel.
From this "distortion" comes an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photo - and then one of the bosses, "power drivers".
A more stable field
It's also with the Higgs Boson, just by the difference that "disrupting" is necessary another field, Higgs' Field to reveal this Boson.
This Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; it needs to achieve very high energy values, such as in the freezing cold of a fisherman, which is only creating a very large balloon.
For this reason, it is necessary to use as large parts of the accelerator as the accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large hormonal accelerator with explosive couplings is bread with 27 km! - so that such energy can be developed.
Analogues with the electromagnetic field are again used to clarify the relationship between Higgs and Humt.
With an electromagnetic field they do not react to all the parts or all the materials.
Some, such as magnets, do it, but others don't-- they don't-- they're never gonna keep themselves on the refrigerator.
And it also pays that not all parts of the Higgs field do not respond to all the parts: those who do so have a certain sense, while others (for example, photo, let's look at it) don't have it.
And Mrs. Novak's question is, why are all these researches "take him"?
From science it is about confirming the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physics to give details of any disagreement between observation and premise.
There were no physical texts before it could be found because the difference could open the space "new physics" and seal some paintings in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge weaknesses, does not provide any explanation of gravity (oh!) or dark weights that create approximately 80% of space weight (see oh!).
However, the CERN device has not yet detected such discrepancy.
Odezvy
The challenges of these research in your everyday life can only be expected very difficult, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be no one.
Look: At the beginning of the 1960s alone, there were no laser surgeons in Bellow's laboratories or a revolution dreaming that their work has already begun.
They predicted scientific use, but nothing else.
Physical Willard Boyle - who worked in Bell Labs, where laser was found in 1960 and who created the first permanent laser paper (the previous paper was rolled) in 1962, I've already said that - laser was initially considered such a "play in the lab".
Just imagine...
In addition, applications can also be derived from any of the tools covered by the research.
For example, Willard Boyle created a small light camera in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This monument, although Boyle did not plan it at first, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and earned Nobel's price for physics in 2009.
Of course it doesn't mean that the activities around LHC have to change our lives, but it means that a person doesn't really know...
Paliative Care - The best way to get out of life... ► Le Debor
By means of his Commission for an adequate measure, Quebec has recently been involved in the six-year-old issue of the end of life.
The debate should continue at an early stage and at the same time be accompanied by a draft law.
There is still much work to be done in this area.
The newspaper Le Debor tried to look at this issue in more detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in Monteregie.
The cancer of the prostitute she was afraid of gave him a double life.
"They've given me five years of life and it's seven," says without emotion on his bed in his house for the palliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he came last day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," she adds.
The patient has done his job: an uncomplicated weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the toilet alone or just to eat himself.
He looks at the delicious breakfast and agrees that we can help him eat.
He's shy and even laughed, talking to strangers who stop him, bring him drugs, offer him a bathroom.
He's going to a normal death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of this curse, the one who humiliates me," he believes.
A few hours later, he found a team of doctors on his problem.
"For the rest of your life, a man learns that the boy's power exists," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois's facility.
Returning to the phase of the child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the abilities of a person," says psychologist.
According to the opinion of a number of people living in palliative care, the key moments are played in the own core of such a return.
Patients who come home with Victor-Gadbois palliative care suffer from cancer.
Their forecast is at least three months of life.
At this stage, medical teams and sisters who care about them do not provide so-called "medicine" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, it is the worst fear of dying "for the pleasure of full consciousness."
But my disease allowed me to reveal my children.
"I have many children," she adds.
"I don't have any hope in life," she says, and then let us put her in a breathing device.
However, she is still happy for the next few days on her last visit from Italy.
At Victor-Gadbois's home, he works with a group of volunteers to provide care for the body by means of survival.
It looks like palliative care that turns out to be if you can't do anything else.
To make death more comfortable.
In Québek there is one bed of palliative care for 11,700 people.
It's very small if we realize we're all going to die once.
Here life continues under optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it's about the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, for example, he can be given a ton of brandy or pepsi, according to the taste.
Diabetics don't have to watch the cold of sugar anymore.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night they brought a beer to Mr. X., who died later that night.
He's drinking his son's beer this morning in honor of his spoiled father.
"We help patients as well as their neighbors," says Nathalia Savard, director of nursing services.
At Victor-Gadbois's house, they're going after each other for days, but they don't like each other.
According to a 13-year-old man who has been consulted since his last meeting with his family based on posters, while being honored by him, a tragic six-year-old man, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children, dies after he has tried all the opportunities to survive.
"For half a year there have always been three or five beds for people with cancer up to 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to Victor-Gadbois's home will come here from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care that is intended to ease the patient’s suffering as long as he gets into the final phase of his life, whether he is at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And a number of organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois and the Grand Montréal Association for Domestic Palliative Treatment, are less highly specialized in the care of oncological patients.
And just this fundamental lack of medical care in Quebec leads to the fact that a number of doctors specializing in palliative care are afraid of adopting the EU law and assisted suicide.
Since October, there has been a manifesto signed by spies in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their disagreement with such initiatives.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure access to quality palliative care for all people until it can be agreed with the implementation of euthanasia.
As she says, she recently survived a patient who spent 14 days preparing for major diseases without anyone taking the necessary steps to cure her.
It is feared that patients will not be asked to die because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, it is paid that a number of oncologists care for their patients until the last minute, regardless of the adverse forecast.
Hope for Hélène Richard's survival was completely minimal when she gave up on order chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist I'd end my treatment, she said she'd regret that I stopped fighting, she'd tell us.
And she told me it was over!
No Powerful Care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the patients who die are grateful to their healers for not meeting their expectations when their palliative pills died.
But it has to be said that palliative care is certainly not effective when treating the disease.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care in the Community for domestic palliative care of the Grand Montréal area, patients are preventing disease treatment in 8% of cases.
At the same end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives that the patient sleeps until the end of the day, either suddenly or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't care about this part of suffering.
A patient we don't know about the pain will have an ever-increasing chance of access to palliative sedatives.
Patients who are not given satativium are always saying, "I want to die".
But it doesn't always have to mean "I want you to give me euthanase," which means "I want you to get rid of my pain."
The implementation of this report has enabled a grant for journalists from the Canadian Health Research Institute.
Wide range of real scandals in Quebec
Travel management officials, construction and public works firms, lobbyists of political parties and experts on the Italian Mafia continue to tell what they know about the wonderful "system" in which buildings, state officials, politicians, committees and mafia are involved.
This "opportunity" came very expensive between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has grown since we took the essential measures," said Iranian Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec Ambassador and former Chief of Police in Montreal.
By 2011, it was launched a scandal on the basis of a follow-up investigation of the media in relation to the construction of the railways in Quebec, which was approved by former liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest even after long periods of time.
The "Duchesneau's report" confirmed the direct link between industry, unobtrusive financing of parties and corruption of state officials.
"Since the start of the survey in 2010,," she says, "only the Ministry of Transport has saved billions of dollars' bans," when some people have kept their instincts on getting shares!
Charbonneau's Commission "has brought her to the dementia of two years," adds hope that she will be able to "discover the plight of some people".
Standing unit for combating corruption based in 2011
A permanent anti-corruption unit based in 2011 is also involved in the fight against its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
In addition to this, the Marteau Police, who have since 2009, made sure that the exhibition "Minister of Money" has significantly reduced the focus of the ban...
In the last few weeks, they carried out a series of visits and complained about the turmoil and corruption of a number of general representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, an elderly town in the area.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his duties of the old town of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
It is suspected that he has again received charges for the exchange of public contracts.
The formal charges have already been received by transport engineers from Montreal and operators of Italian origin, such as Tony Accursso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito called for consensus when he explained to the Commission the "system" mechanism for obtaining public procurement.
During these years, he himself committed 3% of the value of the ban he received in Montreal, to the media associated with the Mafia, which then transferred the money to the Union Montréal page for which Mr. Gérald Tremblay was candidate.
Zambito was sold to all sides after 2000 and awarded over $88,000 (about EUR 68 000) to the provincial parties, especially to the Liberals who were in power at that time.
He also admitted that he had organized illegal financial planning for former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Orders with cash water at which prices were raised
In Montreal he worked "system" corruption very much.
Gilles Surprenant, former transport engineer, described it in detail before the Commission: for ten years he had received from construction companies a gift, an invitation to travel, golf tournaments, to a restaurant, hockey stores and a total of $736 000 exchanges for contracts with money.
Other public transport operators acknowledged that they were allowed to pay the fees because of over 30% or 40% of their turnover by means of unfair overtime.
The organizer of the old-fashioned party, Martin Dumont, then accused Tremblaye of turning his eyes to the common budget, which led him to his warehouse of spinal money.
On the basis of these findings, Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, where Montréal raised a large crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first visual envoys who issued a warning signal.
As an age of Rivière-des-Prairies in the eastern part of the island, since 2010, it has been established against the sale of the total land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promotions directly in the midst of the emerging real estate trade.
70% of spinal money in election campaigns
The study that will finally be started says that "it's too late for anyone to understand the functioning of the movement system to stop the gangrene and beat the guilty".
The process says it's "serious, but cool."
We are in the wound cleaning phase, but we need to conduct our own investigation unit in Montreal and ensure that these suspicious practices cannot be returned.
It's like he's getting down.
All right.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public makers have cut hundreds of millions of dollars" but he is particularly afraid of the role of "messengers informed about this letter" if they have failed in these workshops!
He estimates that 70% of the funding of the electoral campaigns in Quebec comes from spinal money, and ironically he adds, "I've heard that it's just a poor side of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit gifts to $100, but it does not solve this situation: "until there is a strict limitation of voting costs, spinal money from politics will not be lost."
It proposes a complex control of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of parties: "We can't stop; if we focus on the basis of things, we can put again on stronger foundations and with greater control and compliance with laws."
If this story opens the picture of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends that all who laugh at him look at their own court...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
In this season you and PSG have set a whole new time.
How do you explain this development?
You can explain to her that all individuals went to themselves, or just to a new size of PSG.
The big players came to us.
Every day I'm getting along with them.
The technical team also helped me a lot.
Every day these realities allow me to raise the level of game.
And it's easier for the game.
Everything's going very fast in the football.
I'm not losing my head.
From my beginnings in preparation at INF Clairefontaine until after I moved to Saint-Etienne, I always agreed on a single step.
So you're using the competitive environment that led Carlo Ancelotti...
The forces of this year are usually playing games at a very high level.
He also knows that every training is essential.
And it turns out that a player like me has more taste in touch and wants to do the maximum performance.
And Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot to do with my position.
He's got assistants like Claude Makele, who played at the same position as me.
And has Ancelotti got the right word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all the technicians.
Today, there is no balance in the 1st lesson and is one of the best European coaches.
He's got huge experiences and he's got a lot of titles with spy teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he's gonna win other titles in Paris.
In January I graduated from a quiet conversation with him.
I had a lot of injuries behind me.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
On the 1st of July, Lyon took our lead.
But we're still in custody.
One of our main objectives is the League of Masters: very easy access to the osmiffinal.
What's your club doing in this competition?
Let's try to go as far as possible.
It can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a difficult opponent for the quality of European teams.
First of all, we want to win our qualification team in front of Port so we can play in the eight-final home department.
Can the PSG become a short-term orientation for a large European club?
It's already got to be...
To become a large European club, Paris has to win titles and enter history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial page, the PSG has the means to achieve this purpose.
And would it be a big failure not to win in the 1st league as in the long season?
Of course, that would be a big mistake.
This year we really want to win a patient's title.
We haven't missed enough in the London season yet.
In May we were lying because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We've collected 79 points.
It's usually paid that with 79 points you're a clear master...
So another club, Montpellier, had a more amazing season.
I think this is gonna happen this year.
Even though they're strengthening large teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have a weapon available to defeat them.
You think the PSG media are expecting too much?
It's not unusual to expect from us much in view of what we've invested here and what players we have.
That's what we're going to do.
It's the fact that if we win Troyes 4:0 at home and there's still something they're reading in our newspapers, it's not exactly nice.
A man asks what people from you can want more.
Of course it's not gonna win 4:0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to keep our hairy style.
You need time to build a team.
We've proved in Liz's master's office that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, which was no longer in the second season at the end of the eight-year term, and they also invested large amounts!
Given the amount invested, you would be expected to have before the other 15 points of impact!
That's why you threaten the other clubs and the French league.
The Lyon and Marseille clubs, which did not have too much in the long season, moved with the new PSG into the next phase.
It shows how amazing 1st league is.
I hope we'll be able to laugh in the flower and say that despite all the difficulties we've been able to win.
It looks like the PSG in everything depends on the performance of the Golden Ibrahimovic.
It's good to say there's "dependence on Zlatan".
It means that Ibrahimovic is very effective and gives a lot of hair.
That's why he came here and proves he's a star.
Everywhere he went, he proved he was a great player, a world star.
We respect people and players in our team.
And he respects the people around him.
What he got is really extraordinary.
This also led others to raise their own level of game.
Thiago Silva, who belongs to the world's best defenses, also makes it possible for others to grow.
How did you survive the Euro 2012 with French representation?
It's like a fraud.
I wanted to play on this tournament.
I'm sorry I couldn't play as I imagined.
But I survived it and got out of it stronger.
Today, I'm also given the opportunity to play good games.
And that's what I've been hoping for since I moved to represent you.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to be exemplary.
How do you look at the first month of Didier Deschamps in front of the national team?
They're talking about his results.
We're in a good position to qualify for MS.
The coach will choose it carefully, is close to the players and will be able to jump for victory.
That's what Laurent Blanc was like.
But I don't want to compare them.
Blanc has achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will take our team to Brazil.
Is the ambiguity (1:1) from 16 October in Spain a solid easterly game?
This game has given us a sense of identity.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I didn't experience such a game for my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without a bank
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and costs for processing between recipients.
As these technologies are often true, there is a clear political perspective here: the belief that the existing financial system based on banking monopolies leads to the financial crisis.
Bitcoin, by its researcher Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudodo), represents as virtual money (but translated into dollar, euro...), thus a secure translation protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between two partners.
With 15 000 computers connected to the network, nearly 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin course first reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later ended at $2, today it is moving to a limit of about $10 (the price is listed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
Compared with the world's exchange for real money or financial products, it's nothing taxable.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual funds issued in October.
Bitcoin refers to "most successful virtual money", "competitive dollar and euro" and "normal period of money".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money because it's like "credit" used for the video game process that a person gets game or that he can buy (and then change back).
The social network of Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority shall monitor and process individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all online depositors of ordinary accounts, controllers, money issuers and buyers and sellers are included.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between the two e-mail addresses.
However, the user can choose another address for each payment which ensures anonymity.
The data set related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual-key encryption system.
The network can verify the validity of the transaction.
With the content of the file it is still possible to ensure that changed bitcoins exist in the public library of regular accounts distributed across the network.
The key phase begins in writing this new transaction into this book.
It shall carry out the mathematical task of the computer assigned to it, whose solvent, as a temporary central banker, shall have the right to write this additional order.
This is the file-distributing phase, i.e. the transformation of a large file to a shorter and one digital print.
Computers "transmit" this new transaction and add the number to it, just then the whole "cut".
The aim is to find a number which provides a specific print (well zero at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, the other cells will easily control its accuracy.
The transaction will then appear indestructiblely linked to the network of all other transactions; any adjustment would be made to change the print.
If the user wants to pay twice the same money for himself (up to 10 minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the other will be released because each of them has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order for inflation to occur, this rate is divided regularly by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited by the number of 21 million, but it can be divided up to 20 million tons, so the margin space here is...
The difficulty of this task is also increased by increasing the level of calculation.
The network has already survived its rise and fall.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and have come to print stored bitcoins.
"The used shield does not violate the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a company for real money payments using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem is also paid for your readiness.
Prominent players like Wikipedia reject the gifts of this attitude.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, are accepted.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of Weizman’s constitution in Israel recently analyzed the book of ordinary accounts and showed that nearly 80% of the bitcoins do not run.
In November, the "oversales" were started.
"Three thousands of dollars have been changed," John Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who lives in a gold exchange.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the pedagogical books on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a trading network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or a wireless mobile payout, but uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are cheaper.
The carrier also corrects his identity and may remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up for traders where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
It's enough to send the address that can be "photographed and recognized" by the phone, explains Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
It is due to the general movement of hierarchical systems and to the transition to more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin goes on, it's still going on for a while, but 2013 could be decisive," he claims.
In its report, the ECB also proposes to reassess the different risks that are considered to be increased if this kind of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French authorities left their territory of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capis and Surobia).
NATO and US units should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of their territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not all of us.
The biggest surprise was that people in the Afghan outback suffered because we considered them terrorists.
And we, too, have come with 88 killed soldiers, all of them being wounded and frozen.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former leading representatives who fled to Pakistan, but often it is about aliens who reject the presence of foreign forces as in Soviet times.
They only want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they are joined by the Jihadists, the Pakistanis, the Arabs, the Uzbeks, the Tajiks.
They are now using tolerance and often helping local rebels, but if Western forces are to be dropped, their support will be lost.
The departure of the French units from the base of Nijrab, which I was following from the tops of the mountains planted by mandlons thanks to French loans, has been arranged.
The carriages of trucks and passenger vehicles reached Kabul without an attack on the air transport of the helicopter.
Since the end of 2014 the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
From their inexhaustible procedure in 1994 to 1996, conditions changed significantly.
Kabul was once empty and the country was in blood and fire as a result of wars between various warring groups.
Their taking over control of the country was then considered to be a sort of liberation, a return to safety.
The Afghans paid the price for the suffering of these foreigners, who were completely dominated by Al-Ka'ida, but their situation has not improved until our day.
Some Mujahedins, the Afghan government and the contemporary Taliban agree to try to keep women in a position of subjection.
The main supporters of the war against the Soviets returned to power in 2001.
They became leaders, strengthened the state-owned lands that sold as construction lands for refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used large American bans for suppliers.
They were disappointed; most of them were never at war.
According to what I've heard in the campaigns, people are complaining about a government that won't create more crime.
A number of young people want to leave like those who have been able to use American intelligence: capital's uniqueness is important.
Young people are already engaged in war and are associated with it.
During the exile in Iran or Pakistan, they knew the modern world and its benefits.
About 65% of the population is younger than 25 years of age; in Kabul, there are currently 5 million people, five of whom live as a whole.
In cities, public schools are full of girls and boys.
This young people will need to be given work, they no longer want to return to the dark side of the past or to the corruption of some of the representatives.
All, including armed opponents, enjoy mobile phones; televisions and Turkish series that show the modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that will be placed on her head be considered legitimate?
Some leaders of the Soviet army are already renewing provincial militias that are beyond control of central powers.
Afghanistan, which has a strong influence on local identity, should enjoy certain decentralization measures following the example of the Western States, but the United States wanted to change it into a centralised state with a strong presidential influence, so it had reached the abolition of the post of prime minister that had existed since the adoption of the 1964 constitution.
President Karzáí does not want foreign controls, especially when the elections are scheduled for June 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier years.
No industry has been able to recover, no buildings are functioning, no basic loading system has been fixed.
All things are done; nothing is done, except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is a private initiative.
In the country destroyed by the three decades of war, the necessary government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
They agreed to know that Afghanistan has enormously ungrowthing wealth.
And that just made me feel that Western states were here just to strengthen her.
No power to process iron or copper on the ground and no means to transport raw materials across the mountains but no difficulty for non-growth can be experienced.
The Chinese have almost left the middle of Mes Aynak and have left the international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) to explore the vast Buddhist area in order to maintain the role of the most prominent employee throughout the province.
One day it will also need to restore normal relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depends largely on imports and exports.
The departure of French combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement proposes the continuation of common types of aid: girls and boys' leagues, French universities cathedrals, French institutes, military, legal, health and agricultural cooperation, support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative "find out the heart and soul" has been working on the difficult task of accompanying assistance and military activities, under which the service of the Civil and Armed Steps Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, has been carried out thanks to the countless French non-governmental organizations in the field of joint interest and agricultural recovery in tens of mountain villages.
These work, which involved the number of local workers, helped to stem the rise: deposition, wetlands, drinking water, wetlands, fruit trees, soil protection and expansion of processing areas.
What do we keep in mind about two billion euros of military expenditure?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very beneficial in these areas, which are often located at sea altitudes of more than 2,000 m.
The majority received dozens of written requests for small agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Capis.
In order for these farmers to be set free from the rebellion of leading foreign groups, they are willing, in their own words, to obtain unskilled civilian assistance in their benefits that would be properly controlled and directly addressed.
Hard work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Murzy has been admitted to another party of poker.
While Egypt remains the most fragmented in its history because of the declaration of the Constitution, which temporarily confers unlimited powers on it, the bank decided to play.
In the meantime, it was announced without prejudice to the opinion of all the others that the Constitutional Assembly would adopt final amendments.
A few weeks ago, the Head of State made this gathering two more months to complete the necessary work.
For nearly two years, Egypt has been using the provisional text which has been repeatedly supplemented, which weakens the constitutional stability of the country and leads to legal agreements.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country's prosperity.
From the point of view of opposition, the president is in his "autocratic delirie", "he's breaking his word" and "he's breaking the law".
Its supporters, however, ensure that it is a means of speeding up the constitutional and political crisis and speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
It is a very short period of time that will allow the Brotherhood to withdraw from the purpose of the text to explain the article to the Egyptians.
For the President it is also about how to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the entire country rejects protests.
As he confirmed in his speech for the American weekly Time, Muhammad Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
In particular, because this rapidly organised vote puts the Egyptian people before the ultimate: "Let me approve my text or let me have unlimited powers", which should otherwise end after the adoption of the new constitution.
In this special atmosphere, 85 Members of the aforementioned constitutional meeting with a large majority of Islamists adopted the text yesterday.
Most liberals were wrong when they were voting.
In the middle of November, shortly before the Constitution was announced, they knocked at the door because they had no opportunity to express their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities have taken their steps.
In order to achieve the ability to raise awareness, 11 of the number of beneficiaries were added earlier this morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brotherhood.
It is not surprising then that the articles were often voted unanimously.
The commentators continued to insist that one of the non-constitutional debates took place about that day... hours for prayer when some members of the committee held an opinion that the hours in the meeting were not properly arranged.
The text on which yesterday evening was voted shall be composed of 234 articles.
Subject to general attention, Article 2 is finally in line with the 1971 version of the Constitution and states that "the principles of the law of charm are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, hoped that it would replace the term "principles" with "rules", which would allow for more stringent application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their good will and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Creation" means liberals who see only a verbal problem in it.
According to them, the Islamic constitution is being carried out through other articles.
They shall focus in particular on Article 220, which confers on the University of Al-Azhar the advisory role, in particular on issues of compliance with the law of the Sherry.
According to Egypt's expert Sophie Pommier, this is surprising because "people who are allowed to express themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
It can be seen in the beginnings of the theocracy."
The fact that the next rector of the university should be less balanced than the existing one is also growing.
"There has not yet been any specific religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not lazy, but university workers, a number of them have studied in French schools," the peaceful concern of Alexis Blouet, who prepares for work on constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, it agrees that "there may be disputes over the interpretation of Article 220, since the terms used therein belong to a religious dictionary.
In particular, it refers to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science, p.
In the future, there can be a question of what extent civil judges are competent to do so."
Yesterday's approved text, in addition to religious pages, is highly criticised because of the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brotherhood is based on their strong restrictions on the former regime.
Another controversial place: the power of the trusted army.
In accordance with the request of the military representatives, the audit of the defence budget will not be carried out by Parliament but by the National Defence Council.
Then there will be no ban on dealing with civilians in military courts, as required by the Association for the Protection of Human Rights.
This association shall address its doubts about the text which they consider to be intended to oppose freedom.
The fatty act is stored and the infection is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for printing.
There is no article on the protection of a woman, heba Morayef of the Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only valid point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous sentence.
While the Egyptian president was to appear on television last night, this afternoon a demonstration was planned.
The top heads of the state will then show up on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await holy places, the world’s dome and the sea from the sun’s birth solution
The Promised Land links the size of Bible truth, modern comfort, and natural inability.
AaF identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Communion With the Holy Place
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that all those who enter into this "debt" will receive God's mercy.
And Galilee was the place of Jesus ’ miracles: the turning of the water into wine at the wedding feast, the pooling of water, the quieting of the pool, and the filling of the net.
Here Jesus also appeared to his disciples and after his resurrection.
But most holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers here are going through the Way of Pain or Jesus ’ Cross (Latin Via Doloros).
It begins at the strength of Antonia - Pretoria - where the judgment is final, passes through the streets of the Old City and leads to the Temple of God's sepulchre on the Mount of Golgotha - to the place of crucified stone and place where Jesus was buried.
This is where the symbolic crown of the Christian world symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the church of the Holy Cross was built in Jerusalem, where according to the Christian legend a tree grew from which the cross was made to Jesus ’ cross.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place for the Jews — the wall of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people from different backgrounds leave records with hopes that will then be fulfilled.

The reason for Masada’s courage remained secret before the enemy whom Herod the Great set up in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The river is located on the peaks in the mountains at a altitude of 450 m above the cold sea.
Only those who take part in the harvest can get it by their own strength.
The rest of this historic mountain is bringing out the laundromat.
And on the north side of the country is the famous Hermon ski resort, located in the elevation of 1600-2040 m above sea level, which is located in the winter months of the large tourist resort.
To this skiing paradise, tourists travel by bus from the top of the hill.
The entire length of the mountain range is 45 km.
According to ancient legends, they probably lived on the top of the mountain of divine favor.
Visit the unique museum
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You won't be able to visit all of them during one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near Knesset (parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts or candles from the Dead Sea, which were found in the ancient Jewish deserts, and there are some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The visit also includes the Art Museum in Tel-Aviv.
In his exhibition there are its wide range of impressive and expressive coins, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.

Improve your health
The three main Mediterranean centers of Israel are located on the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers pools, water parks, dolphins and oceans.
It is interesting that in Rudém the sea can also be purchased in winter months because the water temperature does not fall below 21 degrees Fahrenheit [21 ° C] and the air is heated up to 23 degrees [2 ° C].
The dead sea is even warmer, and people buy it all year round.
The Dead Sea is by far the most outstanding sea in the world, located in the lowest mountain point of the planet - at a level of 417 m below the cold sea.
Azuro water is a salt solution that is easily kept on the cold and people who are unable to swim.
The surrounding country is unrealistically beautiful.
Get out of here to take treatment with salty water - salts, and a treatment bag that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, constipation of the pancreas, diabetes to treat heard nerves.
Touch the Dark Past
Protecting her from the old part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them was a glorious sea route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The terms of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved beautiful Andromeda, where they then lived together for a long and happy life.
Tourists like toys with colorful streets named after the signs of the beast.
It is said that if you press on to the wall in the street of "your" sign, your happiness will be rewarded.
In Jaffa, you may meet new couples who come from all over Israel and even from other countries to get rid of them.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can go through the Roman theater and "get" the strength of the cross.
In Roman times Caesar was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pilate Pontius Pilate.
A well-constructed theatre is used today for evening concerts and operas.
Tourists, in dictionary
If you are moving to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the Russian population is speaking.
It's better to take your money on the road, not in euro, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for check(there is about $1,8 check).
The city transport is mainly by bus, but in Jerusalem there is a speedy tram and in the city of Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connect the lower city with the mountain.
It's basically about the underground laundromat.
Traveling all types of urban public transport is 6 bicycles for which you can drive 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath was celebrated.
From Friday evening to the west of the sun on Saturday it ceases to work on markets, shops and public transport.
And Sunday morning's work week begins.

In the evenings you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Preducative cats love nestled places and feel free to every good thing.
The rental of the car will be between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 per day (Audio A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $15 per day.
And rent your bike will be about 15 checkbooks a day.
The entrances to the museum are on average 30 cycles.
Number of digits displayed
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists from around the world.
Getting to know the country and rest came from most of the citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, the country visited 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, 51% more than during the same period in 2010, before visa cancellation on 9 February 2011.
"Great and powerful" is a message to Moscow: immigrants save money in their own language
While human rights envoys and defenders are still discussing the law on compulsory language tests, in the country there have already been found subcontractors selling "dedicated" certificates.
Each year 13 million foreign workers arrive in Moscow, Petrohrad and other Russian cities.
Most of them are Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support the family at home.
On 1 December he entered into force the law which requires every migrant worker to undergo a test of the knowledge of Russian.
Meanwhile, this rule applies only to those who are intended to work in the services sector, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the FMS promises that at some time the tests will be required for all visitors.
However, tests will consist not only of language knowledge but also from Russian history and legal basis.
Language skills will also need to be confirmed to obtain and extend employment permits.
The exception is only paid for citizens of a country where Russian is the official language.
This law does not apply even to people who were successful in obtaining a certificate and getting academia to the collapse of the SSSR in 1991.
Use, assessment and protection of rights
The Network of Experimental Places will work under the auspices of the Russian-language Constitution, the National Associations of National Friendships, the Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petrohrad and other Russian High Schools.
Migrants can run tests in all cities; today more than 160 such centres have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to support testing was also supported by the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law came into force, the defenders of human rights were able to put on the press a question: what does it really bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for Russia and for its own visitors?
In particular - responsible for representatives of migration services - it is possible to reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of "child labour".
Many people today talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explained the President of the FMS Russian Presidency in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be started before their departure.
Only a system of organised assembly allows 90% to solve foreign workers' problems.
Problems arise for immigrants without a permit, without education, who do not know the language and have no medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - says Sebelev's conviction - he is a future migrant sentenced to the deaths of innocent people who, under the help of him, will ensure a "show" for the elderly, hardworking living in which he and dozens of others, like him himself, spend months without food and documents and spend 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of trouble from our migrant workers.
"They promise one to them in their power, but when they come, they'll have their passports, they won't pay the promised bet," confirms the Chief Task Force Management of Labour Migration MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't give up!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian Republic, who intend to work in Russia, admit that they do not only know the language of the country to which they want to go but have no experience even with that work.
Of course it is not as much their wine as any more unfortunate: only very few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tadik can afford to get at least adequate basic education.
Of course, their families need something else to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, dressed and trained in school.
As children grow into productive age, work must be done at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language it's difficult - they admit it.
"You feel humiliated and humiliated."
It is true that in view of the law on language tests, the protection of human rights is one of the most important things.
The test will only be carried out by migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't do any tests, they won't get any other official work.
In the meantime, most migrant workers live as illegally as they did in Russia.
"Witness or unauthorized access"
Many of the coming workers claim that getting official status in our country is not as easy.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and all these language problems.
Legalization is also worth money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police personnel know that we have basically false documents, without registration, and that is why we are in a state of emergency.
"Requires a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," he shared his experience with a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
"Well, don't be easy, buy yourself a paint."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Law, it was found that there were false evidence of registration by migrants.
The FMS staff have already had a few false certificates of language testing.
Detailed evidence is printed on the standard colour printer.
Of course, new owners did not get free: each of the migrants in hopes that they would be so vulnerable to testing that they paid for this document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times higher than the formal test is completed: this will be a migrant worker of three thousand rubles.
The main task of the near future is to ensure a system of prevention of corruption so that workers cannot easily buy evidence, which is agreed by government officials and the protection of human rights.
Government authorities can still promise foreign workers who did not conduct tests first, the time needed to complete the course of Russian language.
Visitors who are not Russians are expected to work in areas where there is no need for active contact with people.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not engage in an illegal arms market
The share of criminal acts using legally held weapons is very low
The MVD Russia submits a proposal to clarify the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the response of government authorities to recent events: the incident of the shooting at the weddings that took place without a victim and the massacre prepared by Moscow's lawyer Dimitri Vinograd, which resulted in the death of seven people.
The police want to prohibit the possession of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which licenses can be obtained - from 18 to 21 years.
This opinion supports the head of the Security and Anti-Corruption Committee, Irina Jarova, who promised that amendments to the arms law would be submitted to the State Council in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem of the road "swifting".
In the network, an open letter was published by its authors - representatives of various terrorist organizations - calling for the refusal of "unreasonable clarification" of the law.
The percentage of fraud with registered weapons is minimal, Vasilij Lesnikov, a lawyer and a criminal in a discussion with the Russian edition of BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, 142 criminal acts were committed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs within six months of 2012, with the use of firearms registered by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, while at the same time a total of 1168 thousand criminal acts were committed.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the enforcement of the laws in the field of civil weapons does not accept asylum seekers to pass on to the black market.
According to their words, at present there can be found a voluntary weapon at a low price in Moscow.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the competitions by officials
The black market with weapons is equipped with several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Baranéc, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot page that accepts gun orders
The first one is "military or military road", which means a weapon that was fired during the Kavkaze wars.
"The weapons have also been stolen by Russian officials and the prisoners themselves," Baranéc says.
Other types of "black weapons" are weapons stolen from security agents.
Baranec explains that there are also thefts from police funds and weapons stolen directly from officials of criminal authorities.
Unlawful "mainly" are being brought into the sale of military funds.
In many military reserves it often comes to explosions.
"It has been shown that some fires have been deliberately built - so that there is no such thing as a lack," says an ex-combatant soldier.
They bring their contribution in accordance with the words of Barance and the arms manufacturer.
"At present, private arms companies that are not competitive in the international market are developing and are producing weapons that supply to the black market, including Moscow," says this expert.
Another source of "black" market is hunting.
In particular, a large number of guns and cars come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's their production, sometimes weapons are produced here in small arms production, and there's a mafia that organized their oil production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun?
The experts calculated what is approximately part of the individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
The report on this problem was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for the Analysis of Problems and Design of Public Administration.
The experts collected reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminal literature and information on public data portals focused on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons are reported by researchers, from military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons appeared on the black market "because of the official workers whose work is linked to weapons," says the report.
According to data available to researchers, 17% of armed conflicts are weapons, 14% of them were stolen when they were manufactured, and 5% is "black archeology".
The seller-consultant of one of the arms trades that he asked us not to introduce his name is convinced that the weapons found in black "archeology" warehouses are no longer purchased - they are just too old.
Most often, as he says, the salesmen are driving for new shipments directly into the military reserves.
Through the rapporteur, the interested party buys a unit, such as TT gun.
You order a gun to him and he sells it to you over the board.
"This brings it to the city and sells it for 900 euros for two savings," she reports.
"It is true that the police are well in the picture, and that is why whenever a plan of criminal acts is started to be heated up, control purchases are made by illegal arms dealers," he adds.
"As in luxury business"
The sellers with the most frequently purchased find each other through their know-how.
I visited websites and blogs until there was a guy who offered me the opportunity to go to the "Test" platform, where there will be a man who would lead me to "Qutka" where we will meet together.
I learned the price mostly until I was there.
Military report by Viktor Baranez
If I want to get a gun, I need a known man who knows the way out, he'll send a salesman - a consultant. - I have such a well-known one, but I don't trust him.
The sellers are on the market, but there's also a need to go, hypothetically "by Mr Ivan Ivanovice, who asked me to find out that the daughter was missing."
And now I'm going to get there through the man I'm sure of.
He's also giving it to me because he knows I'm not giving it to him.
Beginners are looking for weapons in various ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranéc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid - 1990 ’ s when he was processing a press release on this subject.
The schematics didn't change according to his word.
They gave him a photo album where there was "all you thought about."
"I felt like a luxury trade," the soldier recalls.
The buyer, according to Baranèce, doesn't offer interest in demand - you can try everything.
I'm a potential client, I'm just not buying-- we're going to go with the salesman into the forest and we're gonna set up a plan.
"They give me a chance to shoot, and when I convince myself that guns are good, we start acting," says a scientist.
Stainless steel
Searchers will bring you online to websites and groups on "Vkontakta", where you are offered to purchase weapons "for various purposes".
There is no need for documents or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a fixed amount of money," they write in the advertising title on the websites "Buy a fight gun or auto".
On these sites users leave their notifications and questionnaires.
What about the sale of cheap?
"Of course without a license," the user "Ivan" is asked (recorded).
"I'm buying TT.Moskva" - it's working on the "Fedorenkov" requirement.
The Federal Security Service has recently decided that a vast network of web sites and individuals who are willing to buy military weapons can capture the ballato.
People feed themselves like hungry fish on the beach and then get oil on Siberia.
Military report and senior military officer Viktor Baranéc
I have heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer will pay for the banknote.
"In response to this, his saleser sent him a photo and a description of where the weapon is hidden," reports the press spokesman of the non-governmental organization Dmitrij Kislov.
Victor Baranéc confirms that you can stay free of weapons after order is placed on the web pages.
The Federal Security Service has recently decided that a vast network of web sites and individuals who are willing to buy military weapons can capture the ballato.
"People tend to feed themselves like hungry fish on the reef and then get coal in Siberia," she confirms.
Macarov for $100
If you buy illegal firearms, you will pay from $100 to $900, according to experts' estimates.
According to Dmitri Kislov from the non-governmental organization "The Right to Arms" you will order the Makarov gun for $100 to $300.
You have to wait for a month and a half.
The weapon shall be transferred from funds to long-term storage through the funds of the mid-Article.
According to the official statistical authority, compared with the winter period, in October 2011, the number of these criminal acts in Russia decreased by 7%, and 22.9 thousand cases were reported and the number of cases of theft and shooting of weapons, firearms, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, employees of fast food and supermarkets are stable
"McDonald" works on a regular basis up to a quarter of all American teenagers.
In recent days there has been a wave of protests against low-cost buildings in Walmart's hypermarkets and in the restaurants of popular fast entertainment networks such as McDonald, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether this wave changes to the ninth wave or whether it is intended to disappear soon.
All these actions support committees and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest fees that are received by a number of workers in Walmart and in fast-paced systems, it is the aim of protest organizers to achieve their creation in their committee organisations.
At present, this economic sector is practically not affected by the Committee's incentives.
46 cents a year?
Actions began last week after the Day of Thanksgiving, in what is called a "black Friday", when the organ of cheap products hit America, attracted millions of people and, in some cases, were also supplied with roaches.
On this day, some Walmart workers, who work for 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and demonstrated together with teams and left-wing activists of international trading companies whose goods are intended for people of lower and middle classes.
Walmart sells all over the world, from plague through hunting rifles and car batteries to dryer, eggs and milk.
The products in its sales range from 8% to 27% lower than in large supermarkets.
That's why many employees with low wages in Walmart's sales are only buying themselves at work.
The availability and variety of goods made from Walmart’s network one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply partly because he pays only a little of his employees.
They also suffer from bad working conditions, such as lack of automatic vehicles or manual scanners.
The "black Friday" demonstrators demanded an increase of fees and complained that the costs of health insurance offered by the companies had grown from $30 per month to $100 per month.
The typical Walmart employee gets $9.5 per hour, but it doesn't meet the costs, employees say.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley have found that if Walmart increases the average wage by $12 per hour, it will be $3.2 billion a year.
It is on average 1.1% more than this company is currently paying.
If Walmart's company moves an increase of half-life on the consumer's shoulders, every visit to the sale will be only 46 cents more.
This year, customers lose about $12.39 more than today.
Walmart's supporters point out that the protest was only conducted in nine countries and that the company should not cause practically any harm.
The "black Friday" in the sales company lasted from 8 o'clock on Thursday to midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items of goods per second.
Its entire warehouses carried out almost 100 million transactions on "black Friday".
The representative of Dan Fogelman mentioned in the discussion for the left-wing Huffington Post website that the workplace left the Walmart's employees "less than five" and that the protest was all "other media sensations" organized by the committees.
"Unsatisfied store!"
The protests continued this week in New York where Walmart's business houses were not intended (they are not too close to the city, and therefore are not almost here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of pieces and then he doesn't pay you for your positive job!
Jumane Williams, member of the City Council in New York
At the present time, the minimum amount of work is to be done in accordance with federal laws and with New York State regulations of $7.25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants gradually raise this demand, but only mildly, and they get their order workers in New York $8.90 an hour.
There's no one down there in this precious town.
I don't really understand how you can live in New York for money like that.
At McDonald's job, almost a quarter of American teenagers who work after school for part-time jobs and live with their parents.
Only a few people look at their main source of life or plan to stay there longer.
At the same time, I keep in touch with McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live with these money and sometimes even raise their children.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal has a comment that the author notes it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know how to hold them.
The participants of the protests that started at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonald" at 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the shopkeepers and cooks in fast food companies start to get at least $15 per hour, which is more than a dozen of their current minimum drinks.
They also called for the establishment of committee organisations in the area of rapid nutrition.
The American laws require the administration to prevent the establishment of committee organisations and to discourage the Committee's activists from spying out and leaving.
On the other hand, it only makes life easier for them.
However, the introduction into the fast-moving companies of the committee organisation is also complex for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons for this is the unusual high inflation of employees.
Non-insomnia
This day there was also a wave of protests in a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The above-mentioned action was in the morning meeting at McDonald near Times Square, where there were several local democratic policies, especially a member of the Jumane Williams City Council, who said, "McDonald" says he sells billions of pieces, and then he doesn't pay you in cash and does not pay you well for your positive job!"
The demonstrators also sought support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as an old-time candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must work together to support hard-food workers in order to achieve fair rewards for their work and economic well-being, which every unicorn deserves!"
As New York Times reported, it was the biggest act of its kind in American history of rapid nutrition.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even though not all of them were fast-moving employees who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will take place quickly, which will result in the blessing of the flame of a mass stream is still unclear.
"In the meantime, the brain gives average clima"
Among the fans of modern virtual reality technologies is a popular theme of widespread reality; it is particularly important in recent times to watch the world through special glasses.
At the beginning of this year’s annual conference, Google presented the work model of this newspaper and it was announced in November that the application for an appropriate patent was also submitted by Microsoft.
In a discussion with the leading group of interactive 3D technologies at the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadim, it is clear that scientists of this company are already looking forward to the past.
The medicine is a perspective manipulation with virtual objects in the air with large hands, creating virtual public media.
- Please tell us in a frame what's going on with your research team?
We're dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time we're trying to shift the limits of this interaction.
People have already been exposed to working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes touching your fingers.
We want to look at 5-10 years ago and predict significant changes in this interaction.
For example Xbox console and Kinect camera - it's a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without Kinect cameras, because for all there is a very interesting possibility of handling a gesture.
- What else is waiting for us in the future?
- Despite the fact that the kinect system has transferred interactions to a physical level, very many interactions are still taking place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system accepts more data), but the output flow is not particularly present.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including design.
We need to get the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the users but also the space around it.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate way.
And in the first row - for hell with those stupid helmets virtual reality!
- What do you think of the voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it worth it?
- Of course he can't be considered by everyone - a private question arises because we don't always want to inform others about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for example, we had a project that we thought about gestures, but not about soft ones, only about such short cuts.
The guest would not miss a camera device, but the direction that would follow the movement of the legs and shoulders.
It's still big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of orange hours.
However, it is generally paid that the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- And how?
- How do you want me to give you this lemonade?
You'll say it and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, that'll be very complicated.
So you want to get users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do right now?
- It's not necessary at all, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work especially on developing new types of cameras that will be able to find out more exactly how people react.
These can be laser cameras, for example, which provide a relatively good depth solution, which is very important.
Do you have to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Is there not enough solution today, deep or something else?
- In general today's generation - that's what we can draw from in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just megapixels. It's like a mother and a deep.
At the same time, all modern technologies are insufficient for us – this is what gives work to algorithm designers.
So we have to remember not only the resolution in terms of X and Y, but also Z.
So it's also very important to speed, the number of photos per second.
The human movement is relatively dynamic and current data flow 30 photos per second are told a little bit honestly, especially for the gesture.
Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond made the relevant camera with a adjustable delay of processing in lengths 1 to 100 ms, while current, serially produced cameras are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much it affects human interaction with machines.
For me at work would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, I just don't need so much touch, but I need some pictures in a second.
- And there's no need to raise the number of cameras?
- In Kinect system there are now three cameras, one of which is actually an infra-red transmitter and the other - the receiver of a reflective signal.
And now the third camera - it's actually a regular camera of visible sand.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or worsen it because it would increase the required amount of the calculations made.
It would be easy to create a flexible analogue system Kinect, play with the closing position of the camera and see how it can help determine the three-dimensional position.
- If I remember well, Microsoft (in contrast to Google) didn't present his glasses publicly.
Don't you think that when it comes to the daily use of technology, the reality of the advanced technology through special glasses, is it one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course to walk and keep your smartphone in your raised hand is not very comfortable, but I think the most powerful variant would be "translatable" like expanding reality if it was possible on the basis of the clouds platforms to switch from flash to smartphone, project display and further around the doc.
Bryle - it's a very personal device, it's their power (one thing you see only you), and at the same time the widespread reality on the basis of which it does not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine at the moment that manipulation with virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also to ordinary mortals.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no touch response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What response does your group make to this challenge?
- In my talks I often say that the widespread reality - it's the seven next half of each other's interaction between man and machine.
I think that supplementing mass perceptions could easily become eight-threat.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - use another hand as a particular type of background for the display.
In an outstanding way, the pressure is recorded!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding mass to these "images in the air" - for example, interference of several direct ultrasound paper in the defined point where the finger is, but it's still very weak - as if you were focusing on the edge of your fingers.
There is also a framework on the edge which affects nerve endings in fingers - also a flexible direction.
- You've already tried to clear your brain?
To think he's feeling what he's supposed to feel at the moment when he sees something?
That's a good idea. We haven't tried it yet.
Here there is another challenge that will be faced for a long time - how to accept a person who is physically in a very tight space to believe that he is moving in an open, practically endless space - we are also working on the concept of running trails (not even such as in clubs), moving platforms as well as large balls.
If brain damage becomes a goal, work is still for many years.
That's what makes work on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - a lot of things are in simple beginnings.
Experience instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petrohrad Avantgarda", dedicated to the people who are in charge, are an Avantgarda culture and art.
At the top of the list were the important positions of the Pedrohrad scene, whose expenditure exceeded the city's framework, often found recognition in Europe without achieving all the expertise.
The new "Rosbalt" garden is an amazing creator of Cyril Miller.
The whole city is known by Cyril Miller - a brave man who is dressed in red, where you meet here at the Russian Museum, here in the summer garden, here in fashion hostels and on vernisa.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they're shown, always attract the gifts of fans.
Cyril Miller is one of the pure social and philosophical petroleum manufacturers, the creators of new myths.
Cyril Miller - this is an ideal husband of the Petrohrad Avantgardy at the end of 80th and beginning in the early 1990s.
Besides being an urban man, his appearance on the streets makes a smile on the faces of the citizens, increases all tension.
He recently took the bottle into his hands and became a petrophoric bottlemaker because he grew up to this complex role in his entire divine life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why are you going all over town in red and not in yellow or, for example, in Turkish?
- I've chosen a red color as a designer with a look and an image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between artist, imagemaker and the public.
He may generally pay for everything that is slightly different from the sedentary, aggressiveness, and the pursuit of bad qualities.
But my provocations are focused on the connection.
The whole story of my provocative actions is primarily an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the Cultural House in New York, where my work was being held.
I understand what my way is.
There was a wave of old unofficial artists and a new, free type of artists I couldn't understand.
I made friends with artists of new wool, post-gasonians who brought us to "Puskinska 10" and there were no other wool.
It's treating me to the theatre, to the clothes, to the music, to all the genres except words.
And all of this happened in your art clinic... it was important for me to attend at the center of Petrburg culture, where all the best powers of creation should be assembled.
In 1995, I had a place at Puškinska 10, and there was a music-art club, a bohem club, a house of peterburg bohemies.
There are many:NOM, Tequila Jazz, don't forget how Shnura brought the project "Ucho Van Gogh".
Snur and his friends sang under the cover of a light song, dressed in attractive tricks, among them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the hat began to play live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg led a lot of hali-galivian programs.
We gave them Trachtänberg, then started his big career, basic education, and training got from us.
"D 137" gallery, "Gribojed" club - it's Art Clinic.
This is where our workers and our permanent guests left.
I'm a hero of the past century when culture meant something else.
In 2000, the study was conducted in print, and the special price was "People in our city".
In the nominee of "The Artist of the Year" I was named me, so my top ended.
In new times, according to the old rules, work is unacceptable, I am a man of truth, motivation and culture of the past century.
In modern years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular but not too cultural.
- Your work is characteristicly recognized.
- A lot of my pictures - these are the hits in which life is caught up in the news and the sense of failure.
I'm going to have a program exhibition "Russian Museum in the Clan."
The clones are overtime categories.
I used to be social. Being such today is painful and terrible.
But in the clans, everything's going to work, the tragedy's filming.
I love Grotesque, I have big ideas.
For example, to save the world from the path of total equipment in the order of order.
Today, people meet by clothes, focusing on the outside mechanism, not on the inner person.
Or maybe he can't hand it over and he needs to swim in his face.
And the curse will be removed by turning away.
We've recently seen you in the role of the city's flashlight.
And who should have it if it wasn't for me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At the same time, it should be commercial, enjoyable art based, tactical, sweet.
It's coming to an end of culture.
In the past, people were trapped in holes, they loved one another, they loved one another.
Today it's all broken up into micro-enterprise, it's very hard today to like everyone.
I'm not a banker to like everyone.
Today, you need to think about who you like.
Today he has every cultural garden of his 100 fans.
- And there's a few thousand fans coming to Stas Michajl's!
- He'll be caught by the fans. There's a sexual social affair.
And there will be 300 people on the cultural ground, and 10,000 will not come, and as a result it's less management, money, everything's cool.
I've got fans. The main thing is that no one's gonna get them out of there and they don't waste what they're alive.
When I was young, I painted pictures that one of the collectors hung on the wall together with Falke and Larion.
I started with pictures that most people end up with.
People today are often confused about ideas.
They say:Culture spiritual, consumer culture.
There's no consumer culture, it's different.
I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up in the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, denied money for drawing pictures.
And I'm for such a culture.
- Cyril, what's missing in Petrburg?
- Good experts in culture.
There is such a concept: a factor over culture.
Not all of them can survive culture.
It wasn't so in all the time of the proper priests, the priests may not have understood cultures too well, but they realized that real experts should be supported.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people who might be experts at the Peter Palace, but they are being held somewhere in the castle because they need great experts who properly evaluate these experts and they'll introduce them on the right path.
Today, he is benefiting from the experience.
Also, Erarta, but it's different from saying honestly that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should look for another museum.
- What do you think is Petrburg?
- Petrburg - it's not the main city of culture, in Moscow culture is much more, there's this right floor.
And on our hill art is poor.
We need cultural soil, but we have more writers than readers today, that's bad.
In Europe there are very many people who are curious who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
We only have such a weak species.
We need art to become fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is carried out by means of the St.Peterburg gift

The country is at risk.
Global warming or collision with deadly asteroid.
The caravans of spaceships from land on the deck are on their way, looking for a replacement planet.
To save mankind, there is a basic question: How to maintain your family under difficult conditions or on a given planet?
I don't think the choice is so big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be won, even if only hypothetical.
"It's Venus and Mars," says highly established scientist of the State Astronomy Institute P. K. Šternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
But while there are better conditions for life on Mars, on the surface of Venus, temperatures reach 500 degrees Fahrenheit [- 500 ° C].
Living there is only possible in the great height or orbit of Venus... in the universe.
To solve the questions of reproduction in the universe, scientists started with the flower.
Half a century ago, tests on plants were carried out.
The four generations of the game on the common road are nothing different from their earthly lovers.
Then an abortion was performed - very small fruit men of Drosophile.
In 1979 we were sent to the universe to see how the embryo develops into a state of ease.
We get a absolutely normal bird at the exit.
But then problems begin.
"The problem is that this bird has to find comfort, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving," says the leading laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.
If they don't find resistance, they're chhaticky birds fall down and they're making potatoes.
After 10 hours, the purely fledgled birds came to a simple burst of instincts.
Birds didn't react to light or sound.
And the problem was they just died within four days.
"We let birds escape twice, but then we refused, because it's just impossible to work with them," comments the sequencing of the experience of Kurts in the universe of Vladimir Syčov.
The last "miniarch" of the animals flew on a common road 16 years ago.
In 2013 experiments will continue.
"Bion" biosatellite, but they're only gonna have one sex.
He's been experimenting with rats who were sent to the universe already pregnant.
They didn't reveal anything out there.
"It was only on biosatelites, but again - it's about a unique experiment and such attempts are to be carried out," says Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on the ground, a generation of cosmos were born.
However, it has not yet been able to approach the problem of multiplication directly in the universe.
It's a tough job.
In the loss of normal living environment, animals simply cannot realize their basic instinct.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens rules by abstract thought and is able to create a corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying to space for 50 years.
The greatest danger has been the threat of Törezkov.
The most precious thing mankind has is a woman's body.
Our Father flew away and no one on Earth could say if he'd been flying into space.
Is it possible to have a child after such a flight?
"No one has yet answered this question," says the Vachtang Vačnadze rocket veteran.
In June 1964, more than a year after the universe, the first woman to be born by Valentina Tæreškov's daughter was born.
The father was also the cosmonaut of Andrian Nikolay.
In 1988, the son of the second woman-commonator Light Savicke, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in an open universe, was born.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts born after years of birth and growth of offspring.
"It can also be dangerous at orbital flights," says the Cosmonaut-pilot, Hrdin of the Soviet Union and Hrdin Ruska Valerij Poljakov.
However, mankind must look for new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK hydrolaborator is the required stage of preparation for the summer.
Here, under zero-accompaniment conditions, cosmonauts win the skills needed to work in an open space.
The water looks like it's tougher.
The water may be comfortable for adults, but in its own way, it's a wonderful environment, for young children, it's natural.
Small whales seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the child is on average 9 months in the womb of fruit water and that it is easier for them to get used to water.
In principle, this is logical because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first purchase, it takes only 2 weeks.
"It's very little about forgetting something," says Marina Aksenov's New Year's swim instructor.
Technically it is said - if the condition of a newborn is more natural than the situation of a newborn child, then for a woman there is a more natural unexplainable pregnancy, an attractive force.
In the state of ease, it comes very quickly to guard the muscles, the muscles of the head, the delicate ability of the body to produce fruit.
We can leave this on the side if the stimulants of the speech activity at birth work.
The end of the end is possible for the birth to take place in a special room in which the mother's organism produces fruit.
"And what further?" Valerie Poljakov poses complex questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism is not able to cause soil addiction, it cannot properly form a bone or set up muscle.
Newbornness on the common road is not possible as an adult in a special suit which is difficult to train.
He'll just get rid of what he needs for his development.
"If we come with you to an experiment that will allow the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring to Earth a healthy infected person who will not be directly suited to the environment," the lead committee for the bioethics IBMMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So the birth of children in the universe is just a theoretical question today.
Once, however, a time will come when the earth will become a reality and the earth will be transformed into a distant planet that will become home to their offspring born in the universe.
Head of the NKU: Control of the sugar system has reduced the wine policy
Czech Republic has good control and quality legislation in relation to public orders, but in its application.
In the discussion for Current.cz, the Vice-President of the Miloslav Kala Supreme Control Office says.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that's what I think is missing," comments Kala's current situation.
Similar conclusions also indicate joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of the wrong practice, Petra Nembes points out access to the so-called "scholar system".
Recently, Mr. Prime Minister said ODS would not be responsible for its controls - is it therefore prohibited or permitted?
"The law must be contrary to certain rules, and if anything is prohibited, even the President of the government cannot prevent the activities of an office which has the duty to check and discharge its duties," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee in Parliament, you spoke in agreement on a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What exactly is this?
It's about parallel control we started about two years ago.
It is simply said that European legislation manages how public procurement is managed, followed by individual national legislation and then by practice itself.
We have all done this together, and even though the control is not over yet, we have shown very interesting differences - generally called legislation is perhaps "more precise and perfect", however, the practice itself is in some parameters better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to continue to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to commit to the application of the law itself.
What can this project really do for you?
Just such joint control could contribute to our continuing efforts to clarify laws, reduce and improve borders if that does not have such a positive effect.
The economy means getting a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to exclude counterfeiting and, where appropriate, criminal treatment.
But by lowering the limit, we don't have to achieve it.
This system may require such a number of "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system, so you will get a lot easier than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about Turkish problems with the translation of legislation on public bans into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is this office similar to our NKU, or is it set up otherwise?
As far as the authorities are concerned, like the NKU there, Bundesrechungshof, which is organised like us, also has a college, is only a bit different, but in principle both offices act similarly.
The powers are also similar to certain respects, although Germany has a common organization, so these accounts also have a level of individual collective countries - this system is somewhat different from ours.
The BRH can only control collective money, which we have in our state resources.
The public funds that we have managed by the country and the citizens are controlled there from the level of collective accounts.
What are the darker laws, so that's easier than ours?
In general I would not like to compare this without specific data, although in some respects Germany has been marked as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that it is better in any way.
So it's also necessary that they have better controllers?
I'm sure not, but I'm saying again, I don't like this comparison.
But it must be said that even countries we consider to be a model are dealing with a number of problems.
Otherwise there would be no contribution to working with our office, wouldn't it?
What about foreign legislation, which means that the new law on public procurement for your office already has some impact on it?
Given that the period of validity of this novel is relatively short, we are not yet in control actions.
Because we're doing ex post checks, we need to calculate with a certain delay.
We are only looking at this in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new tool "detection of the risk of unemployment", through which we have passed some 14,000 public bans, and we have analysed them - these changes will be made in understanding, as the changes in the limits, the conditions of some types of choice are managed and similar.
So, then, do you consider this law to be more profitable than any other burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is definitely the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can happen here is that it's "relative" rules and it won't be possible to keep them.
For the purposes of the previous rules, controlled persons are already obliged by suppliers (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council) to ensure that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement constitutes a breach of the budget penalty.
So does the law have a price to be fixed in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it and not those who allow formal doubt to affect their decision.
Such a system will only create greater pressure on bureaucracy.
So how's it going out?
Let's show you where they don't take the road.
Recently, Mr. Prime Minister said ODS would not be responsible for the controls of this so-called "scholar system" - and what does that mean?
Is it prohibited or allowed by the system?
The law must be contrary to certain rules, and if it prohibits anything, even the President of the Government may not prevent the activities of an office which has an obligation to control and discharge duties.
He can say, "We change that law and allow it," but he can't say we're gonna do it like nothing.
In the law on public procurement, there are relatively strict rules on how to formally implement - which is correct in order to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the best offer interests are excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that's what we're missing from my point of view.
The roads are narrow, mostly but smooth
In some places the Czech Republic is surrounded by roads and also flooded.
Most of them, however, vehicles are relatively convenient, some with increased caution.
Karlovarian Republic
In Karlovar's country, there were rails on the road this morning, places, but they were tired and tired too.
The temperature is between five and ten degrees below zero, but during the day it has to melt slowly.
There has been a rise in snow in the region and there are only weak species in the lowlands.
On the Red Mountains, however, there are about 30 inches [30 cm] of snow.
Places were even less visible due to the brain, resulting from data from the dispersion of national drivers.
The R6 speeds and first-class communications are now unlimited in the region.
Caution is always at the place, for example, at some places where the surface can be soft and clumsy.
There are also all roads second and third classes including mountain roads.
However, in some areas the remains of frozen and frozen snow are still on them.
In particular in the above areas, increased attention should be paid to the road.
Pardubic and King's Land
On some roads in the eastern Czech Republic, there is a threat of hate, in higher places and on the mountains, the type of snow can be caught in communication, informs on its pages of the Road and Distance Guidelines.
Railways protect drivers from the cold, especially in the higher places of the Pardubic country.
The following can be located around Lanskroun, the mouth above Orlica, Poličky, Svitov or the High Museum, especially on the roads of second and third classes.
Chemicals have been contaminated by I/43 and I/34 in Svitav.
Snow is especially on the Krkonoš and Orlic Mountains.
The snow type is the highest in the railways in the Richnov regions over the Kneznou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Czech Republic, it is most clear today that there is no strike.
Temperatures usually move between minus 3 and plus one degree of celsia, resulting in low wind.
Plenary
The railways in the Plyzeńsk country are on track this morning, but with increased caution and driving time needs to be adjusted.
It's after the morning of hate, the temperatures move between three to nine degrees below the bottom of the ice.
After the previous discharge and the next relief, some communications may be indistinct.
The places must also be counted with the moon, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is due to information from the dispersion of national drivers.
The D5 distance is almost unlimited, with increased caution recommended by communication managers between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first class motors have dry and wet surfaces.
South Plenary and Tachovsk, but they can be mature.
The communication of the second and third classes is weak and in this case there is also a need to pay attention to the intended purposes.
Drivers should be cautious mainly on less frequent roads in the area of Shumavia.
Olomoukian country
With snow cassettes on the road today, it is necessary to calculate the direction drivers to the highest point of the Olomouk country.
After the chemical takeoff, she stayed on the Czech seat and on the road towards the Videl Cross.
The railways to the area escaped on snowing nights, and on the way to Šumpersk, according to the road managers, they had a three-centimeter bridge.
In other parts of the country, vehicles are mostly compatible without restrictions.
"On the Schumpersk is located in the highest snow balance.
With the snow cassette on the Croatian seat drivers have to count in the direction of Jeseník," the CHTK spokesman said today.
Their colleagues also appeared on Jesenick's field at night, and the roads to the highest places are now thought to be full and wet after chemical healing.
On Olomoukk there are roads that are unlimited, however, in Strasbourg drivers should pay attention to the forest areas where the trains remain vulnerable.
Instinctive country, in Liberia
Several difficult railway stations are reporting today after the morning of the train on the north of the Czech Republic.
In addition to a few places with the snow or snow, a mountain railway from Telnica to the Book of Usteck is closed, it comes from a police database.
Temperatures are maintained even in lower zeros, so ice and snow are apparently maintained on the roads.In the lowlands, especially south-east of the Chechnya, however, there are no problems and the roads are dry.
The operating complications are not yet reported.
The rise of the ice is reported by the railways, especially from the area of Protective.
According to meteorologists for her, the ideal conditions were at night - through the day of rain and the silent snow, at night clear and cold.
The main charges are reported in non-conformity conditions as well as on I/13 at the border between the Baltic and Liberian countries.
The closure of the Telnica on the Library drew on the embodiment of trees that were exposed under the snow to the driver’s nose.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think it has to do with the end of the world in a few months?
It's just one of the more frightening news that we people like to catch.
Together with The Tap Tap's hat we're doing more fun and say we're the only hat in the world that can gather enough positive energy to keep the world away or prevent it.
In December you also organise a simple single project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to readers?
It's a national benefit action we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the May calendar announced on 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before 20 December of 21 hours, 3 concerts were held in Prague, Brná and Ostrava.
They will end in the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in Tichomor, which is in the 12-hour period ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
At first, it was my idea, then we were all thinking together with our Creator, Honzo Augusto.
In addition to trying to gather enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state in which this world will once be passed on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items of bots, tricks, bags or original keys against the end of the world whose purchase at www.e-top.cz can also support us.
The Tap Tap tap together with other interpreters also sang a so-called hymn against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Disappeared".
He's already very popular on YouTube, is he also involved in these beneficial concerts?
Of course, and it's in full conclusion, so if everything happens to us and the end of the world doesn't come...
All three concerts sing together.
Hymnes are immediately offered in a unique direct transmission to Czech television.
The words of this song were written and the main role of Jesus in the play of Tomáš Hanák, also known as Xindl Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We're also working with other Czech cultural characters, since we're organizing a lot of positive actions and concerts...
We are trying to get them into these projects intensively.
It has been shown that most of them are interested in and interested in us.
What's going on from the concerts against the end of the world?
To provide a free educational center for Studioo, which we have been working with the Tap civil society in the Jedlička building for six years.
For students of Jedličk's school, lecturers come regularly and engage in activities that are fun and interesting.
Students themselves do not have the means to get out of school on their own, so we try to make it possible for them to do so.
Within the framework of the delivery of the Jedličk facility in the future, a separate building will be built to which we move with this project.
There are several musical groups and interpreters at each concert.
What did you choose from?
We've been trying to establish a program that works for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague is Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustrapere with Dan Barto, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchi.
All details are available at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombstic action" to the future?
In May we will first go to the Prague fair, so here we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
The next year, we would also like to play in the Czech national home in New York, and I would like to do this with the show in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalistic, you've already shown, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is however a group that creates people's handshake.
How do you manage these roads logistically and organizationally?
It's not as scary as it looks at first sight.
We have five members on an electric car, their cars have to travel in the condom space, and of course we carry a lot of costs and poverty with the tool...
However, it has always managed without problems, ČSA and British Airways were well prepared for us, that I've been able to wake up a few times.
Even in Moscow, where we were back recently, that was no problem.
With exits to the border, you can compare how individually you are exposed to barbaricity, public access to the hedging and similar.
What have you ever met with?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than we do, we were just witnesses in Russia that in the east there are still in full starters.
On the contrary, Moscow is a very barrier, where it is still unusual to move on an electric car alone in the center of town.
It doesn't pay for any kind of self-evidentness, as drivers need to give priority to the race.
Happiness has also resulted from civil society, which is trying to warn people of the problems they face.
What, though, do we still have to get more productive countries?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation are always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it's quite common that even people with a hard handcuff are moving on their own to the public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
But it's not very common that a large number of people with success would actively participate in social life, in which we are with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respect for public or non-barricularity is one thing, but only when important sportsmen, artists, priests, politicians or lawyers are among us, things are really starting to change.
There's still a single case of people who have a strong will.
Capela The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years ago what it was up to you in 1998?
I was raised as an educator to the Jedličk Foundation, where I had many young people around me who were interested in something.
And since I'm a musician myself, playing besides saxophones, so I set up an interesting musical circle together with my colleague.
Well, as time goes on, as our modator Ládía Angelovic says, a little out of his hands (Laughter).
But she's been popular for the last few years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that it helped us when we started talking to famous singers and also actively working on the sermons of the chapel.
We've learned that work that's not visible is basically like there's no one.
In addition, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can allow quality lecturers, training and so on.
Was it your goal to bring it up with The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Showbusiness is filled with things where one looks like another.
It's its logical way, everything new is taken care of and it's going on for a long time.
The stars that are united are very small, but I'm going to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first idea of the man who first sees us is of course sorry, it's natural...
But this pity is very important because people with hendikepe are not suffering any of the abandoned properties that we need to forgive.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, assuming that they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if something happens to people with a hendikepe, it's not just a move for them, it's for the whole company.
Did this success also help you to be a good boss, as many people have noted?
If we want to do a high-quality job, we must be in many things uncompromising and require a certain discipline.
But I think it's very normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and with their head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to the test twice a week, get ready and spend a lot of time on the concert trips, the excitement is fast gone.
But that's how it works everywhere in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
At present, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only Ládá Angelovic.
We're an open group, people are coming and coming, and that's not gonna stop.
Who has the will and the taste, we always have the door open
The actual day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours
Courses in Prague Incheba arena, Brné Flédé and Ostrava Plynojem for 12 chapels and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities end up playing telemos at the joint song The Tap Tap Tap "The End of the World Disappeared"
The aim of the concert is to pool financial resources for the provision of a multifunctional non-barrier education centre STUDEO at the Paralytic Institute in Prague of 25 million Kč
Initiated at the concert is 400 Kč, children up to 12 years of age have access to free entrances in front of Bohemiaticket
Polish and space.
In the past week, Poland was adopted by the European Space Agency for the second member of this European Space Agency, as the second country from the country of the former Eastern block (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the next few years participated in a number of Agency projects.
It's been a long time since Poland's journey to space.
In the years leading up to the second world war, the Polish superpowers had already been engaged in space; but they did not always meet with understanding.
For example, A. Šternfeld in the Warsaw Astronomy Observatory, which presented ideas from its work on 6 December 1933 on the entrance to the cosmonauts.
The thoughts of the young engineer (1905) left the audience hungry and after years, Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld gained access to cosmonauts in France at the price of Robert Esnaul-Pelterie and André Louis Hirscha.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became the great promoter of astronomy and cosmonauts.
In Polish newspapers he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books assigned to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became the world-known promoter of cosmonauts and was also assessed by the name of one of the craters on the back of the moon.
In 1925, a railway train was established in Poland, which was to be fitted with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately the author of the proposal is unknown and we do not know the details of the project.
It is not clear whether or not the rocket should be used for the discharge or for its contamination.
The information about this cut is only known from the print of the paper.
Since 1933, rocket fires have begun to take place in Poland.
The research provided a Chamber of Arms Technology in cooperation with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolf and Professor Gustave Mokrzyckieg.
It is evident from the materials collected that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
The investigation was interrupted by the German army's arrival.
In 1937, in a professional press, the project of photoelectric racing rockets, which was proposed by engineer Rohozinski and the following year the work of Rakieta - aerospace torpedo and rocket bomb by the author of Lelywy-Krzywoblock.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects of military use of rocket techniques were dedicated to the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Timed Scientific Committee) which coordinated all work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of action, it ended up in war.
Further work of dedicated cosmonauts in Poland after the war in Poland is revealed by the work of the Polish Astronautic Society (Polski Association).
The first is the reference to the company in the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problem, which contains the four more comprehensive articles of the appointed astronaut.
One of them, by Professor M. Subotowice, is designed to create a company that will remain a cosmonaut.
At the time, the projects of the art community were already under way and it was clear that space research was a perspective.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautics Company (PTA) has been trying to enter the International Astronautics Federation (based on 1951) and has already become a proper member of the PTA.
And next year, PTA President Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice-President of the International Astronautic Federation.
This function remained until his death in 1959.
Since 1956 PTA has contributed significantly to the development of very successful meteorological rockets RM (Meteorological Radiation), which has become the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and came to the first start on 10 October 1958.
The access rocket was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, the perfect version of RM-1A was established and in 1959 the Bledov desert began double-distance RM-2 tests.
The rocket was 1,4 metres long and its weight was about 11,5 kg.
Another development type was already capable of real scientific work - RM-34 rocket had access to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
In 1962, further development was suspended.
The following RM-type first rocket became the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a double, its overall length was 510 cm and its initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (defined as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) that were different from the size of the space for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket there was available space of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 he was at the Institute for the Development of Meteor-2 rockets, which began its first flight tests in October 1970.
The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying useful weight weight weight of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The later versions of the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were set up.
There is still a need to mention Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Poland also started researching space within the Interkosmos programme on Soviet art associations, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became Vladimír Remk's second intercosmonaut.
Breaking the Public Works Act is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court broke the Public Works Act.
The conclusion has led to a lively discussion on the public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU are also based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition in a globalised world.
In its effect, this means that individual economic institutions, national economic systems, are in a permanent conflict.
The reason is the principle of free trade and free movement of private capital together with a sound financial speculation.
The impact of significant differences in labour prices is due to price pressure.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation when the producer tries to import cheap goods into economic competition by ‘conforming’ the price of the competitor with a view to achieving a greater share on the market and thereby increasing its own profit.
In mass it means that for most businesses either transfer the product to a foreign market or buy it cheaply or lose it.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are higher than other economies.
Since private capital does not have any social responsibility and, therefore, the unemployment resulting from it, the social costs of the state are increasing.
The whole situation makes it easier for business owners to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social benefits they have suffered in the past.
The situation is so generally known that specific statistical data should not be entered.
Independent private capital practices are created in individual economic situations when the governments of individual countries are forced into competition with the aim of reducing the social level of their own citizens with a view to attracting foreign capital.
In other words, governments give private capital the advantage of their own citizens regardless of social losses.
This is reflected in particular in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to encourage its own citizens to accept the price density of private capital, particularly in the field of gambling.
However, this is a system of economic lending in the case of long-term unemployment, but the limitation of workers' rights in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty is growing along with the growing gap between the poor and the rich.
There have already been several years of public spending on poor people who cannot enjoy their own jobs.
The number of these people is going to millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for people to get a fair employment so that they have to be paid to an existing minimum.
Such a scandal has also been published in the case of auxiliary staff of the joint network.
Conscientious measures by all the southern EU states will undoubtedly lead to the same status when people under the pressure of a catastrophic catastrophe are forced to either migrate as they did in the 19th century or live for food shortages at the end of society in hopes of a certain investment capital coming into the country at least once.
Where do you need to go, but where does he come from?
If this is from other EU countries, then poverty is moving from one country to another or is not coming at all because China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, or Egypt or Africa are still working for European currency.
It's all about Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media in terms of ageing argue that the state cannot capitalize on its own economy, that the managed economy leads to economic disaster.
In this respect, the State should not be able to apply the rules of the State to the economy.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital is not affected, which is now actually leading politics and this whole state in its own selfish sense.
There's a unique answer here.
The evidence is that there are practically all-powerful and all-inclusive lobbying in all states.
As a result, there is a reliable situation in the area of corruption, by providing mutual benefits, by legislation where virtually everything is criminal but not criminal.
In the SRN, the situation is such that State ministries for the lack of financial resources are responsible for drawing up draft laws to private legal companies that are late in business relations.
These draft laws are then agreed in Bundestag.
Not all of this comes from people like this from Western constitutions, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is evident that liberally oriented democracy is now rapidly getting to the situation as Appianos describes it in his part of the crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state has been in full distribution for a long time and the authorities have been involved in violence.
For fees, illegal acquisition of goods and for the use of stones or stones.
The underpaid and corrupt people fought without any restraint and people went to the elections with the previous sold vote" ... "the characterized people didn't even know about the office, so once this divorce was eight months without consulates." . .."The result was that the only remedy in the bad situation was self-government and that it was necessary to choose an energy man."
The conclusion As in the past, the current company is based on an independent preference for its own benefit regardless of its general interest.
The private capital is no longer able to understand and apply its entire benefits.
The result is now, as at the time, an unprecedented decade without any effort to reform the deeper race.
We must therefore look for a causal of the rise of fascist and communist regimes in the independent liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the present situation, the absence of these systems in favour of liberal democracy can be considered to be a certain stop with the expectation of another car.
Especially disastrous is the fact that current elites in the future are completely ignoring possible statistical losses in lives, humanitarian and social disasters that we are now witnesses of crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
Breaking the law on public works is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of economic competition at both international and internal levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of citizenship.
So this trend is system-wide.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that strengthen the state's capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in the interests of the state.
Israel: Chaos laboratory.
"There's nothing wrong with violence and it can't ever come out" Sting in the song of Fragile, whose main verse in the refresher is "let's not forget how we're breaking."
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be any" dying Gutel Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there were many reactions.
One stands behind Israel, argues about his right to self-defence, and Palestine belongs to the role of terrorists, others supports Palestine, argues the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide of the Palestinian Arabs, and the States of Israel belongs to the role of the terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who has been born into the current political situation and who has been the victim of the repeated wave of killings of the innocent and who have finally been born, including today's Israeli citizens, into the present political situation and who have not experienced the beginning of violence.
This is what I'm going to offer readers a view of the opposite, the view of which has been serving for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on the small coast of the Middle East.
Some of my views are supported by available historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who resp. which group of people is the main contributor to the events of modern history.
People's actions are in the first series of game stories about power.
At any rate, we can look at some of Alexandra the Great, or Napoleon.
What's not so clear is whether these were always those individuals who were rather autonomously taking their steps and whether someone was behind their throne who directed their actions towards the stated goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that money and its flowing power have not been able to survive by one generation.
Among these astronomical rich families is one that could be considered to be the head of the shoe shop (if anyone is still standing above them, but I don't know) - Rothschield.
It's not too much about them.
Copy that.
The first printing agency (Reuters) had already bought in the 1990s to stop connecting their name with high criminal effects, which were behind them and which were always meant to restrict power, wealth or both.
They have major shares in almost all the central banks of the world and against countries where the central banks do not have to lead or prepare wars (before the attack by Afghanistan, it was 7 countries, after the attack by Iraq, it was 5 countries, after the defeat of Kaddáfi, only four, but between Russia the central bank of the Russian government was headed).
Whoever tried to stop this family, he died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Central Bank of Rothschieldov Bank of America, began during the civil war to issue his own (intellectual) money and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began to issue its own money and wanted to cancel the FED, was murdered in 1963, and Ambassador Louis McFadden was executed in 1936 after he wanted to appeal to the FED for a major economic crisis in 1929.
Their passion for global power led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of the plan of three world wars as the highest wall, 33rd degree dedication by Albert Piek.
The first war was to remove the great monarchy state in Europe, the second to remove colonial power, particularly Britain, and the third to reduce the world population somewhere between 0.5 - 1 billion people (such numbers of children for their approval and luxury are enough and do not need so much resources), the creation of one universal religion (emenism is nothing more than a solution) and the final transfer of absolute power.
The method that a group of the richest families in front of Rothschieldy works is the issue of crisis and the next offer of solution (order ab chao - order of chaos).
However, these solutions are false and are always leading to a deterioration of the situation (see the FED Foundation so as not to reverse the crisis as they were called in 1907).
So after they had been killed by Habsburg's successor, R-U, the throne of Ferdinanda in Sarajevo for the first world war, they destroyed the Russians by the fall of the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended with an unprecedented, military and economic downturn, the capital of Germany (there was no war for the destruction of Russia) and then came to the destabilization of Central European power, Rakouska Uherska.
To facilitate the discussion of the Second World War, politicians have allowed the creation of a late conflict situation by putting large war repair in Germany, which they have created in advance of radicalizing the supplying mass and then were sufficient to support the Germans with sufficient strength, bearing and simple solutions of the present Leader and still creating a strong German minority that was to be defeated, as well as the role of the fifth column, in the conquest of the warfire.
By the end of the 19th century, Rothschiel’s foundation of the Zionist dynasty, one of which was based on the creation of a Jewish state, was in preference to the historical area of Judah and Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The previously mentioned Balfour declaration created a forecast for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, beginning to reach the first sights with local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks were on both sides.
The second world war broke out if Hitler broke out of the network at which international bankers initially held him or whatever he had done was difficult to figure out whether any suffering of European Jews at the concentration camps was a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and similar to the war-reparations in Germany in World War II, the declaration of the State of Israel was made by the Third World War.
If international bankers can discuss it, the Jewish nation will, like the second, sacrifice in the first line of war, now with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of anger and chaos not only within the country but also in an international measure (we will only take care of people on behalf of the miners and the repairers of Israel).
Who is the blamer and who is the victim in the Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where the cry of violence results in an endless chain of violence when, at the beginning of everything, there is the pervading spirit of individuals and their thirst for global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the simple citizens of Israel from their leaders because, like us, international bankers support people's choice of their own elections.
The current Prime Minister of the Netanyahu River is a typical example of the fascising international bankers of loyalty, a policy that is doing everything to resolve the war with Iran, which would threaten the growth in the global conflict and the control of Iran over the Hormuz Peninsula by 20% of all the world’s rocks (the blue corridor is only 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is the general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world order in their presentation is the world of men and children.
A world where the rest of the human population serve the strength of financial aristocracy.
A world where every new born unit is implanted at the birth of a chip that makes it a fully controlled habitat.
"And they encourage all the small and great, rich and poor, free and children to have right hands or heads of grain so that he cannot buy or sell who is not named by the name of the tribe or the number of its name.
That's what you need to understand: who has the wisdom to count the numbers of the letters.
That number represents a person, and that's the number sixty-six."
Argo: When it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979 he held the duties of demonstrating Islamic students of the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
The missing were to be replaced by the frozen Mohamed Réz Pakhlaví, who fled to the United States after the revolution, which was the patron of his regime several decades later.
For the U.S. administration, she did not offer a positive outcome - she could not afford to wear a hat over the deck because it would undermine her trust in alliances in other countries.
The loss of hands, however, was not possible in Iran, where the revolution was triggered by the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was the morning for the U.S. loan, which later intensified the fiscal attempt to free the hands.
The diplomats were finally released after 444 days after the meeting was conducted by the Algerian government.
Their actions at home called for a wave of solidarity and a spirit of opposition.
Debakl in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's failure with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film of director Ben Afflicek Argo describes one episode of the story that America has brought about a little victory.
Just before the embassy was arrested, six employees were fired.
After complex perpetuities, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian capital.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, made it available from Iran, helping with the extravagant coverage of history - they went to Canadian passports as members of the film station, which looked around the country's location for the show of ski-fi grandofil.
Combination of Genres
The plan that the expert invented on "exfiltration" Tony Mendez also required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to make the legend credible, the film project was written in specialized stores, the press conference was organized, and the firm had a real office.
The details of the operation were long-standing, the film comes from Tony Mendez's memory.
Affleck's film is a special combination of more genres.
On the one hand a realistic concept of political thriller, also called "caper motion", the story of a piece of taste, a visit - for example can be a series of Danny's partners.
This is how the events - on the one hand, documented sequences from Tehran (the title series shows iconic time photographs of events and ways in which the same situation was presented in the film - are not very different).
On the other hand, a walk away from Hollywood, accompanied by irony and peace of mind.
And then again, scenes from the CIA center and other institutions - men in their clothes collect situations at the same table, at the office's walk, on the phone...
Ben's Afflict gave him a good start in career.
From his smile, he became a respected director and even his legacy ceased to be the meaning of ironic notes.
Argo is his third full-time film, after the dark crime of Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the city thriller (2010).
At the same time, it's the first Affleck's picture that doesn't play in the director's home Boston.
At the same time, a sense of the local atmosphere was among the characteristics of the director's older films that elevated the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also broadcasts it in Argu, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are played in the streets, when real events are reconstructed - the initial sequence of the invasion of the embassy is due to its transparency, which at the same time intersperses the emotion of confusion and uncertainty that occur when the course of events is somewhat clear.
Similar effects of Affleck and his associates are achieved in the scenes of thought (a false pillar on the Tehran base).
Too many events in too many places
The director had to make arrangements even though the right story did not actually offer much in the sense of filming scenes.
He's quite successful with this little thing, sometimes he's actually thinking about something - it's not going so elegant anymore (the scene in which the terrorist crisis on the Tehran airport opens up a phone in America and the honech after the run is quite hair-fixed).
But the lack of Arga is the frustration that results from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the role of Hollywood staff, but their positions would serve more space and are not the only ones in this film.
Affleck's film so much losing dramatic touch is a picture that is possible to follow with peaceful interest, to evaluate the achievement and retro style of rising thrillers in the '70s.
But it's just hard.
As he reminds us of one still a certain way of living history and evidence of how the representations of powerful and knowledgeable secret services have been changed, but they have become.
Rules for the fixing of balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankniknipopatky.com, which issues an annual questionnaire on the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to issue a competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU.
"It has led us to the last event when the EU is planning to adopt 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," poll organizer Patrick Nacher said.
Among the so-called absurdities, for example, recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the merger of rates for men and women.
To date, women in the prices of life insurance have been rewarded because they are less objectively risk-free for insurance.
"More incredible ideas from the EU can be nominated by people at the end of this year.
The vote will then take place by the end of February 2013,” Nacher reported.
The EU’s controversial Regulation also requires the mandatory placing of biodegradable substances into the environment, which is a result of environmental damage, to continue to prohibit the use of reliable mercury heaters only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances or the directive on the size of blind cells, as a result of which the eggs have been explicitly exposed this year.
In the past, criticism has also led to an actual ban on the use of the term ‘mean oil’ or the removal of classical toys from sales.
The quality bathrooms have 14 centimetres
The Union apparatus often decides under the pressure of both commercial or industrial lobbying, whose requirements in Brussels are usually met by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic is now subject to its banks' requirements).
Lobby interests remained because, for example, bananas had to reach at least 14 cm in length in the Union and should not show "analytic closure".
The European Commission, however, defended that it only harmonises traditional non-union national standards which complicated trade.
The EU's standards on fruit and vegetables have already deteriorated over the resistance of some states, indicating that existing directives lead to food pollution.
The candidate for victory in the survey may also be an EU Long-term Regulation which should also include a warning that children under 8 years of age should not smoke without adult supervision.
The EU was calling for an American research, which says the balloons between players are leading to the death of children to breathe.
Similar restrictions are now paid for children up to 14 years of age when breast-feeding.
Curiosian ideas are born at home
However, it is quite absurd to use the name Macedonia (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia) in the EU with regard to its official role.
In cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economics Laissez Faire, the Bank's Bank's Payments.com server has appointed a survey in addition to some of the abovementioned absurdities, and a Union regulation on the volume of food resources in the territory of the Member State.
The EU has established maximum levels of food resources that could be found on the territory of the PRC on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the quantities set in the reserved languages, which threatened him with high fines.
The survey organizers also suggested paying a certain country the idea of having no sea and the idea of making a request for a grant.
However, these ideas did not occur in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are disabled because we have no sea.
We ask the European Union to refund," said Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in the autumn of 2004.
As he argued, we had a lot of seeds and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, had to be full of funds that he had to carry out.
In view of the fact that the Czech Republic continues to have ports, the EU had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros according to the Palace.
Finally, the European Commission launched an attack on the organization of a tender for the purchase of seeds from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant grant grant grant was offered by the Ministry of Local Development under the direction of the German Minister Paul (US-DEU), and in particular the application for the grant from Brussels was to be received.
EU: Official regulations are exceptional
In the Member States, it is easy to see the meaning of criticism, EU efforts to regulate and at the same time to improve the functioning and development of the Union as a whole, according to a number of experts.
A more serious problem is, for example, to cut the EU contribution to projects that do not have any sign of any joint European integration, but which were excluded by Member States during the budget negotiations.
The relationship between the Czech Republic is also encouraging that, like other Union countries, the EU must fight in Brussels on the right to specify its traditional products, which does not always succeed in this sport.
As soon as the sixties of the war with Germany and the Rakusan were beginning to mark the olymous creatures, but the Tumish room, whose tradition in us until the 19th century, had to be renamed by our producers to the Tumak.
The designation of room can only carry products from trite distillate, not from sugar fish.
In the official list of EU-registered products, there have already been cases of carlovar sugar, confectionery and constipation of fatty acids and gorgonsol, marcipan from Germany or Parms.
The EU's safety mark can also be mounted on pardubic peach and hot tubers.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man attack that he wants to run for president?
I don't care if I'm a senator or president.
If it works in our country without any problems, I'm not going to apply for it.
But I can't see how the country has been stealing over the last 20 years as the crime is running, people are getting more taxes and the age of retirement.
I shouldn't have been a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to figure out how to change it.
And since I've been forty years old and I'm independent, I have no other choice than to influence things than to apply for a senator or president.
You got to the Senate, but you got your interest on the City.
Don't you turn your back on the people who chose you?
All the time I said I'd go to the war on the City as a result of the Senate elections.
Later I made it clear that if I'm elected senator, I'll apply for the president.
My goal, but it's not a function, it's a tool I can perform my vision.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate.
But the problem is not only that as a nation, we put it in heaven and on television, but that we listen to anyone who wants to try to change.
To that end, media that denounce a person and that demand freedom of speech lie free of charge.
I may have been told that I was a reporter or that I was the counsellor of Jiří Paroubka.
Let's go get your visa.
In the war on the City, you have voiced this heavy and criminal responsibility for politics and the return of property recognition over twenty million.
That's what you need to change the law.
As President, but you have no such right and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I was a citizen of a community who was willing to make a free life, it was possible to do so.
The problem is policymaking - if someone comes with a good idea or correction, he refuses to accept it, and the citizen keeps it.
As an independent foreigner, I have much greater potential to receive support from all the parliamentarians.
My priority is that I can take something that's the best for our country, without any foreign scans and dogmas, from every side, and apply it.
Do you think you're more than a man of justice or a man of the left?
From a Czech point of view, I think I've got a lot of people on my left.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a little left or a little transport.
It's important for me to move forward.
I don't care if anyone belongs to the left or right, but I want people to join.
I will always support any good public solution, even if KSCHM or ODS propose it, and I will also resist the wrong idea.
You'll be afraid when someone says you're populist.
But don't you prove what you said?
When you create a business plan in the company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world or are being talked about by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you'll have only a password.
And you won't be long enough in politics.
Or do you think that if you go after people and talk to them, you'll be given criminal and heavy responsibility, for example?
I don't have a choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get on our side so that we can pass on it.
If I have been elected President, it is not a problem to arrange a direct television transmission where I ask the President of Parliament to take a heavy and criminal responsibility for policies, officials, judges and state representatives.
And they should probably tell her why they don't want her.
When there is a strong personality that will be called a fraud, it can be pushed on a political scene.
Take the president's direct vote, it was a matter of public pressure.
At least I say I'm an amateur that I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my views and views, I'm trying to find a connection.
I've just started politics and I'm trying to get most support for my programme.
I've been trying to take care of myself, it's not going to happen, I'll end up in six years and I'll be back in the private sector.
It sounds like Okamura's supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not doing anything in one person, so I've been running a number of famous people, whether they're not going to apply to Senate.
I went with Radim Jancuru, who refused because of the amount of work.
So at least I supported the research journalist Jan Lorenc, who covered the basements with light heat oil.
I've been praying that people are really upset, but now I'm pregnant.
Sixty percent of the people didn't go to the elections, and those who went were mostly elected representatives of the institution.
We're just two independents in the Senate.
People called the Senate so that changes would be difficult.
Yet I will fight for my vision, such as for the direct election of the elderly or the Haitians.
Do you consider setting up your own side?
I haven't considered it yet, because I don't have time to check on the clear past of every potential customer, and I don't have money on it.
I don't have any money on the presidential campaign, my transparent account is only 20,000.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property recognition, what's yours?
I'm estimated at about 60 million.
In Prague I have 25 million land mines, ten million houses, another eight million houses, a collection of works of art about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and the damage of Superb for a million and then I have a few million on account.
By the way, I've got Aston Martin because it was my key dream - I've always liked James Bond, who was driving in the car, he was galant to women, and he was fighting evil and nonsense.
You drive aston Martin, you own 60 million and you don't have money on the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to give your own money to it.
It's not too convincing.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
Is that what I'm supposed to owe?
I've already killed 2.5 million people in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors testifies to the fact that my program doesn't seem to be that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for my campaign.
The cost of the campaign will basically cover what I'm going to get a senator's salary.
But I wouldn't get out of it, for example, I couldn't pay my son an English school worth 30 thousand a month.
If I just want to make money, I'm not going to apply.
So you're still going to be a business so you can live?
Didn't you say you're wasting these activities?
But it doesn't depend on higher pay.
As I promised, I partially wasted my activities.
For example, a passenger will become my representative on the bridge.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will protect the Republic.
But I also need to live from something.
How common were you as a businessman to take a month?
Two hundred and 400 thousand, which I'm taking.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
You will find the whole discussion on Saturday's issue of law.
MVRDV architects are evidence that real well-being is not only played in the head - for example Spijkenisse and recently established High Book - 2 photos
"This building belongs to me happily, looks futuristic. It's finally going back to seeing something interesting," says Lisette Verhaig, who goes around the corner of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "Well, that house is nice."
But I wonder why we still need a book.
Everyone has Internet, iPady and e-books.
None of these old-style books are available today, are they?
Spikenisse, a place close to Rotterdam without its own job opportunities, which are not even available for the visit, holds a special record.
This population of 80,000 shows the lowest education rate throughout the Netherlands.
In order to solve this foolish situation, several years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and to set up seven beautiful cut-off railways miniatures of fixed bridges, which are displayed on eurobanks.
The educational achievements of Offensives, but it wasn't quite the reverse.
And so the business cities realized that there is only one way to become statistical gentlemen: we have to have a library!
Winy Maas from the Rutterdam Architectural workshop MVRDV, a master crazyly shy column graphs and designer of funny, often even cynic buildings, accepted things with ordinary rest and at the competition in 2003 he appeared with five books under care and a cover on his face.
And while the Commission was still looking heavily around and waving its shoulders, the widow Maas gave her gifts to herself according to her size and her activistly reasoned words ended with the words "Dear City Citizens!"
So this is my proposal to the Hor of the Book in Spiekenisse, called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the hour was 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalisation project, which includes the underground parking lot, the supermarket, the post office and several adjacent residential and rare houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November the Hora book was named after the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also named at Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
A small town store that has never been able to offer more than a post-modern step zone and a rather painful workshop for which you would rather expect milk, is thanks to a bit of modern architecture.
But above all, now Spijkenisse has the first public cultural building in its history.
Long Road to the Book
First opinion: a four-year elforado under the cover of the cheese.
Through the mass of the mountains, the peaks run out, but you will find real space and readership much more when you reach the topography.
On all sides the bright interior is bright and transparent, the base of the burning cabin and elegant street lasers clearly express the atmosphere of the public.
The city environment is perfect.
You see park clubs, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And all books, books, books.
"Normally, the rules stand with books around the stage and in the middle is a large dark area, which is mostly non-violent and personal," says Winy Maas.
We set up a classic space configuration on top of our feet, and space for the reader we pulled out outside.
Inside Hory books are often used: offices, Internet libraries, chess club, ecological centre and central domestic techniques are located in the center.
The special relief is the black police on books that are once walled, once parapeted, and otherwise amputated.
The look, the structure, and the tastes make a difference.
Over the unknown building material, it even engulfs architects and construction engineers.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, leading project at the city of Spijkenisse, on a standard magazine question.
And so we hit an appropriate waste product from agriculture in one cold farm one day.
For many years it has been used as a base under the roots of a millimetre root from synthetic mass in the fields of the Netherlands.
It's cheap and time efficient.
This textile lasts for one, two seasons and then matures into large waste.
For the library there was a red - first in such a quantity - heard on boards of a thickness of four centimetres.
The resulting noise and pressure is known as Landbouwplastic (KLP) in dark, homogenous and heavy material that smells a little like a new car and a little like a sport.
You'll get to the top after 105 stairs.
At the end of almost 500 metres of long journey, you will be awarded not only a fantastic view of the city but also of Dutch croquets and flowers.
They care about the atmosphere, but mainly about the correct humidity of the air in higher literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"If you don't believe it, but this house is despite the fact that it's a lot of a flat show project on ecology," says Troubost.
He's getting up and colding the ground heat.
Although the Sermon on the Mount stands under a clouded cover, the light of the sun is only short inside, and it is even in the sun.
A wide range of beautiful wooden mats, which stand around the scattered phase, serve as a stopover and capture a large part of the sun’s heat.
The atmosphere in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of us are doing a lot of automatic roles.
Stefan Spermon, an IT-based skeptic, has already visited the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig was there already.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, which Boekenberg even identifies as "the long-term expected soul" Spijkenisse.
Reason: Every city citizen was invited to open a book from his personal fund a few weeks ago.
This was to be the first to be filled with optical paintings not entirely equipped with a library currently numbering 70,000 pieces.
The concept has been proven.
The police are completely filled.
"There's nothing worse than an empty book," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation, every citizen now has a certain relationship with the new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if she was just on vacation.
MVRDV was involved in a royal discipline called the creation of identity in a professional gargon.
Spiekenisse wrote the history of literature.
Let her be young and uneducated.
That's the end point for identity.
For example: "The Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained from voting in the decision on the adoption of Palestine.
According to U.S. and European expert Stephen Szaboa, Berlin is thus balancing hard-on-food diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany at the beginning of the week first signaled that it would vote against the proposal for the observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
But Berlin kept the vote.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he's even supporting the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - but it would still be too critical for Israel.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also held a vote on the establishment of an air zone.
That's the end of NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The reason is that it is just changing its foreign policy, which is a policy that has been called the United States, towards the German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans are between the two fronts.
They're expected to play independent roles, but they're not used to.
I think they're just living in their role, but they're on their way to a "normal" foreign policy.
The foreign policy they have in France or in Great Britain.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
It shows readiness to engage in national interests and the existence of which are independent of the existing US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, so export and its relations with certain areas, whether Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from the economic interests of others, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Were economic interests affecting the situation in the Middle East conflict and voting in the UN?
First, Germany has a large residential area in the Middle East, especially in the United States around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to scare the public, but not the elite in the Arab countries.
It's always playing a role.
I don't want to sign it, but it's not quite a unique relationship.
However, it plays an important role in German opinions at all times.
Has Germany’s relationship with the United States been damaged when, in the case of both important decisions, Germany maintained a vote, for example in the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the United States, there will be a great deal of understanding for the German position.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic as Libya's question.
It's probably because Germany's gonna even have to pay some respect.
This also indicates that it must be considered as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are various views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S. has made it clear that it is for the veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These differences were always due to the American internal policy.
I think Obama's government may have a significant understanding of the European position.
But as a result of the darker political situation, this situation cannot, of course, be stopped publicly.
I think the differences in views are not as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Ministerial President Netanyahu, Obama is not much more than Netanjahu's policy.
Is it not difficult for Germany to harmonize its relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it difficult for the Germans.
For Germany, of course, it would be a bit simpler if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently happening.
So they can't be part of a wider line and they have to change things from their own position instead.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future and will force Europe to a European existence.
This is of course not easy for Germany because of Israel's relationship.
It was always a sensitive subject.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play an independent role.
See Germany itself in the role of an important international player?
Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not normal, it is still unacceptable, and for this country, for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, always when Germany plays a major role, there will be a wave of resistance.
It's not easy for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable for the most diverse neighbours and opinions and it's not easy.
The impact of the United States on European policy is still on the horizon, but the EU does not fill this vacuum at present.
The Germans will just have to play more.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and it makes them even more unpleasant - it's la vii!
Stephen Szabo is a representative of the Head of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, D.C., where academics and policy experts from Europe and North America jointly study the challenges of the transatlantic community.

"Protected Sign" in China: when Puma and Armani are Chinese together
Armani is a well-known sign, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
What's Armani Polo?
This hides the mark which has been registered in China quite officially, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it uses protection for as long as real owners don't regret it.
And even then it's not clear whether they're legal.
"For foreigners, it is increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in the violation of security rights in the Far East.
Every week, I'll have a new case on my dog table.
The participants already have enough letters so they can sign up.
From the Gucci characters, for example, Lu-Gucci will become and instead Prada will be allowed to register Prada-Kny.
In this way also German companies are legally copied, which is required by the manufacturer of Puma’s sports goods.
Pattloch will open the list of the sign office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, one Chinese company was allowed to protect the trade mark Zegna DF Puma. A name that is also sponsored by Ermenegildo Zegna's fashion house.
It is known that China's masters of the world are in copying and corrupting mental property.
In large cities there are several retail houses in which customers are sold almost exclusively.
Pattloch's case is different. It is against the trust of its mandate that Chinese companies are officially entitled to use the label that has already been protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associated character.
This word refers to "Bang Dakuan".
That's what's meant by women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It hurts business, we have to lose it," Pattloch calls.
"The sign is clear, the distinguished position disappears, the damage to the image is huge."
The financial losses and the costs of the industries achieved will amount to millions, especially in expensive index products.
According to CLSA market research data, China is the third largest market in luxury goods and markets that grow faster.
However, the removal of the missing records in the register may be difficult and something is worth it.
The cutting can take up to nine years, with an uncertain result.
Pattloch reports cases when the court refused the complaint because the name issued was after a long period of "market reality".
When he has a sad side of violence, he has to pay the plaintiffs again because he has damaged his mark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's a jungle law.
Known cases are also related to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler won a legal dispute with the manufacturer of Sany's construction machinery, a company that recently took over the German producer of pump pumps to Putzmeister's concrete exchange.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use the emblem that resembles the star of Mercedes.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used the mobile logo that was mentioned by BMW. The track was utilised, Geely had to change the logo.
The manufacturer of the fashion product Lacoste lost in China with its partners from Hong Kong and Singapore, who surrounded the famous crocodile by a wrong direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO flag authority will state that there were too few employees and space in 2010.
But in the London year, it is possible that "the process of working has returned from the emergency situation to normal".
For example, the number of unprocessed auctions is 22 per cent.
57 000 of these cases were closed, 75 per cent more than in the previous year.
However, he still waits for 81,500 trouble at the office.
Something against it is expensive.
As it is often in China, these are impressive numbers.
In the long term, more than 1.4 million applications for protection were granted to CTMOs, which is almost a third more than 2010.
It's a record and means that China is set up to lead a list of new subscribers around the world.
This is also paid for the number of all available protection signs - they are up to 5.5 million.
In 2011, payments were chosen by 1.8 billion June.
This simply means that each average notification shall amount to 1280 June or 160 euros.
Initiating this dispute is a number of ways to start the dispute, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
This group has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarists for more than seven years.
The Germans have achieved that its illicit production of imitation car parts has been destroyed.
However, the distributor has guaranteed Chinese rights to the flag of Freudenberg.
We would remind ourselves of this because in Germany there can't be any protection, says Hanno Wentzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO flag authority also rejected the presence of the minority company.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg has violated the law, but the resistance in the dispute continues to fight today.
There's a serious need to pay attention
It is now a matter of concern to the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that this will lead to a good end and commend the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "The cut is extremely expensive and we're worth a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs cannot be calculated. In the company's archive, they even had to look at hundreds of years old records to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg, on the contrary, offered "high-six-six euro coins" for the purpose of settling the dispute.
"You see what that means for us," says Wentzler.
It's dangerous that it's dangerous from the Far East, too, for Europe.
And that's when the imitations will ensure unprotected signs.
One Chinese producer, for example, wanted to sign up for Freudenberg for his clothing and clothing in Germany.
This area of business was long abandoned by the group, although it was able to refuse registration.
"It's important to pay close attention," says Wentzler.
He and Pattloch lawyers advise German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It's not enough to rely on international flag law, and foreigners should rather be "all that is worth protecting, registering in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise it may be much more expensive than registration.
As a result: if Freudenberg’s last performance is subject to the flag of its drama, then it is likely that it will have to pay the license fees for its own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we'll be in the controversial segment pushed out of the market.
World Day Against AIDS: Dating, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Imbunga Congregation is trying - and in Swaziland, poor parents who have died of AIDS are happy.
A connection history that exceeds much more than 8733 kilometres.
First of all, they're looking for a caboose high boots, basketball boots, ladies' boats and pancakes looking for a taxi park and quickly find it.
One or two or three or four.
Then they slowly take the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - they rush, mom and each other.
29-year-old director Fiete Hopfa is almost twice his textile boots when he connects the voices with his attractive gestures.
It's Monday evening. In the music son of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbunga Congregation is trying a new song.
There were about 50 singers and singers from 23 to 69 years of age from the human genetic research center on the home page.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy version, each congregation voice has another text and is still in very foreign languages - a bridge that speaks ten million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Sweden.
Help for Self-Help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Control Organization programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are living with HIV infection.
Of this 23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 orphans after parents who died of AIDS.
HIV is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after parents who died of AIDS, Esitjeni found Voices for Africa's patronage in Germany.
Seventy of them visit a second grade school.
For 15 or 20 hours a month, you can take a patrol.
It guarantees a school, school uniform and one hot food daily in the Gogo centre.
Impuni means "reforming stories" or "the one who loves."
No one can speak in this space, just sing.
For almost ten years now, the congregation has been training songs in this foreign language and sometimes bringing them back to where they originally come from: Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 miles [8,733 km] from Heidelberg, it is still located in the northeastern part of the Kingdom of Swaziland, which is dependent on the ability to vote in the German congregation.
Forty percent have been infected
There's a lot of people living there, some of them still in simple clay or broken clay.
More than 300 of them don't have parents anymore because they've infected you.
In Estonia, it is seen in a small corner of all over Sweden: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest expected life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The clothing of men's garments, which is clearly reducing the risk of half-life, is not accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland carry weakened immunity in themselves. There is no shame that they die in the next thirty years.
This village was formed by the congregation on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005. However, members of Impupi have seen many children on the streets who lack not only parental care but are clean of all: food, clothing, education.
Without finished school, they have no chance in the poor country.
At first, it was a private meeting of individuals who were able to send a child to school for a few hours a year and give him one hot meal a day.
A year later, however, a collection of Voices for Africa, which has since been taking care of orphans after their parents who died of AIDS, has been established almost professionally.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexual abuses?
The bacterial SPI includes syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common source SPIs are HIV, human papillomavir, herpes Genital or hepatitis.
Mushrooms and soil belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the most successful group?
Syphilis and faggots are especially common in men who have sex with men.
Robert Kocha's Constitution is based on the fact that at least four out of five cases of syphilid reported in Germany have been transmitted by sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, they are sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently, chlamydia infections, trichomonides, candidosis (sing), faeces and human papillomavir.
HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults among us, but 20 per cent of new HIV infected people belong to this group.
Among young people, chloromidial infections are more frequent than in other population groups.
According to European studies, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years of age.
In addition to us young people are often exposed to human papillamavir.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of syphilids assigned under the Robert Kocha Institute increased from 1697 in 2001 to 3698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infected people has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2700 cases.
It's a mess about a decade less than a year ago.
What are some signs of a general illness?
Infectious disorders may cause genital pain, difficulty in exercise, rashing, diarrhoea or bradycardia.
Often, however, no pain or other symptoms are caused and therefore remain unattended.
How can you protect yourself?
Hazardous fines can reduce condoms, however they do not offer 100% protection.
Because origins of sexually transmitted disabilities can be partially transmitted by infection from uncleanness and close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend, in particular in the case of frequent harassment of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In case of time diagnostics, it is possible to cure most of the CPUs and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to the patronage, charity gifts, and in the final ranks of the honored ones, the congregation will sing all over Germany, collecting some money.
"We have already sent a total of 200 000 euros to Esitjan," said the president of the company Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is being spent in the unique village of Zodwa Dlamin, a self-concealed woman who can move.
He also cares about finding grown - up children, such as some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as he says to an old woman in Zulu, is a nursery of the village.
Some of them also took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads and made sure that the children were delivered every day in uniforms to school.
Children who no longer have any children go into exile to Khanysile, a single woman who pays together as much as two cooks who cook more than 200 hungry children a day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" founded a school in Chichia, set up two cooks, and together with the American health organization PSI arranged that many people in the village would stop testing HIV.
It's not a coincidence, even though there's a disease all over the country, everyone's quiet about it.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," said Annette Lennartz, "because she has something to do with sex."
In fact, it's quite strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 husbands.
The last absolute black African monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his peaceful lifestyle.
We're going to take the place of democracy.
In addition, the approved way of life by this State is also responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in the last decade.
But there are also many migrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are on every street free, "but no one uses them.
Culture is different - not protected."
To support the cultural exchange at least a little, the Imbunga Congregation travels once in two, three years together in South Africa and sings a song full of horror, war, confidence in the future and awareness of the black people that many in the southern tip of the black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing in black words - such appreciation brings not only joy and joy but also tears of joy in many strange border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitian, where the singers visit the children, over which they have a patron.
Even though you find this universe on maps, the Ezulo river valley is more than he knows.
"Go to Esitian, there's light," people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is an air charm 8733 kilometers from here, to the duplicating singers in an experiment at Bergheimer Straße, you see that light of light even here.
Messenger: NASA revealed at Mercuru led
Sonda Messenger found evidence that Mercur ice is on the planet.
The ice cover could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The U.S. National Aviation and Space Agency (NASA) demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet of Mercur.
Although the nearest Sun is, there is also frozen water as it comes from three studies published on Thursday by the specialized magazine "Science".
The Sonda Messenger has found evidence that there is a ice cover in the area of this planet, which lies on a permanent wall.
This is probably at least 30 centimetres and may even be up to 20 meters strong.
This water came from all of the comets or almost all of the asteroids they found in Mercuru.
But let's not let's find ice in relation to the existence of life on this planet, he said to the leading scientists working on the Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, research could help us to explain how water and other basic life changes are made to other areas of the solar system.
Sondy, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix, an unobserved landscape, participate in space depth research.
From time to time, the pictures go to Earth, a small window into endless stages.
The picture comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists from the Maxe Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, besides planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which surrounds the Sun around Neptune, Ceres is not according to a new concept definition of the International Astronomy Union of 2006 "the planet".
This expression from the infrared picture of Spitzer's telescope shows "family portrait" of countless stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, highly identifiable are pink-coloured "no-rozened" on the birth-salt star.
This area, where stars are created - scientists call it non-romantic W5 - revealed Spitzer's telescope in Cassiopeia in a distance of 6500 light years.
This dying star has caught Spitzer's NASA telescope.
The inner ring is composed of material that the star has grown during the dying process.
In the area of the Gulf of Trifid, which is 5400 light years away from the Earth, new stars come from the rain and dust.

One of the largest and most obvious pictures of Hubble's telescope: religious galaxy
The pictures of spiral galaxies become real art parts according to their color.
The survey published by the European Southern Observer shows a few thousand light years of distant trifide in the Star of Fire.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (tripidus divided into three parts, triangular), because dark dust particles divide the heart of this star family into three parts.
In the universe, the Hadonose astronomers photographed the appearance of cosmic radiation: 400 million light - years from Earth, a woman with two moving galaxies on her head, and has to go to the coli.
This creation of the star marked Hubble's telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn't like technical cuts can call it a South Wind.
A photograph from Hubble's space telescope shows the appearance of the Iris moon in the Cefea constellation.
This 1400 light years is made up of dust particles that are 10 to a hundred times less than normal domestic dust.
This picture was composed of optical and X-ray pictures of various telescopes.
It depicts a ring from black holes that is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This galaxy group called Arp 273 has named Hubble's space telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxies are called UGC 1810 scientists.
In this constellation is the most famous group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The planet's collegiate star is still creating new growths.
This star cloud, also associated with the Rosette moon, is still born to new young stars. They are 5000 light-years away from Earth.
In this clear burning galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, however, just blue.
Scientists believe that it occurred just a short time after the Great Cross, when it was a major guide throughout the universe.
Our view of the universe: the most important telescopes
The view was probably found in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Another year before Galileo, he used it to observe the star.
From that time onwards, optical telescopes have been increasing - and the views that are being passed through are still deeper.
The largest telescope in the world was 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope at Palomar's observatory near San Diego.
The view on this picture was about three feet [5 m] in diameter.
In the United States of America, the Large Binocular Telescope is located.
It enables us to look into the universe with two rectangles right now, each of which has an average of 8.4 meters.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias interior on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. It is only about 10.4 meters away.
South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to reduce costs.
Although its average reaches a depth of 11 meters.
The non-exhaustive design method: the telescope is secured by a high-speed telescope, which is limited to its mobility.
In his high-ranking role, Hobby-Eberly telescope is also fixed in Texas.
His peculiarity is a high-strengthening light stream.
Despite a relatively small scale, this is equivalent to the world's largest telescope telescopes.
With radiotelescope in Arecibu (Portorico), scientists in the universe are following international signals.
This radio telescope has an average of 305 meters.
At "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - search for foreign intelligence - it can help any computer owner who makes available his calculation performance.

They stand here by the Very Large Telescope and honor their name.
This view with a total of four mirrors can also generate a medium-infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large-scale view is also planned for the ESO's Chilean observer.
Its main core has a total of 42 meters and is composed of about 1,000 particles.
The pictures can be calculated first in 2018.
Two Keck's remote views on the Hawaii Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world by 2007.
They're offering two glasses, each with an average of 10 meters.
The kecks are part of Mauna Kea's observatories, which, in addition to them, observe the universe and the help of the Subaru and IRTTF telescope.
The Mauna Kea also has a new range of telescopes - with a three-foot diameter.
Here you can admire her on the picture.
The most important findings from the universe, however, are through Hubble's space telescope.
We've been enjoying remote worlds since April 24, 1990.
The Kepler Space Telescope has been five since March 2009 after extrasolar planets - especially those that are civilized.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been discovered since the start of the mission.
The picture contains the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The spacecraft James Web (JWST) will be shot first in 2018 into space on the Ariane5 rocket deck.
The main view of the space-infrared telescope has an average of 6.5 metres.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Great Cross.
The scientists are from ice in the southern part of Mercure.
However, there are no reliable data, since the Messenger is traveling around this planet far closer to the north.
Radar measurements have been showing for several decades that it's on Mercure ice.
Thanks to the Missionger survey, which was sent in 2004 and is the first one running around Mercuru, scientists now have their certainty.

In southern Azerbaijan, many live in Bible times.
There's even a long-term museum.
Looking for a walk in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
I'm driving worse than Talysh. We can call it a romantic monster.
Microbus accounts for many loads along the road along a wide range of well-bred wells, wooden rivers, and simple rural settlements.
It's all green and sweet, almost like we're in Schwarwwald.
However, this is the highest in Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is just a few miles away.
Here is the Caucasian ethnic group of Talyš, which is not very well known, except that it speaks perfect Persians and Azerbaijani and lives very long.
The final station is Lerik.
This city is too monumental to architecture from Soviet times that is not going to the small mountain country.
Tourists from Europe don't travel here. Coming from the Azerbaijani capital city of Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours for 323 miles because the road is only one way.
The vast wealth of which the country thanks to oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet reached its shores.
However, Pilate Fatulaj (48) is convinced that Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Great Eurovise in May - and next year we will have the oldest people in the world's festival," Fatulaev says.
He's the director of the long-term museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the documented life of almost eight Talysh from around the world who are older than six years old. Fatulajeva shows black photos.
That's my grandfather. He was 120 years old.
At 136 years of age, he was still giving birth to a child.
However, the opposite star of this museum is the shepherd of the Shirali Muslims, who was likely 168 years old.
There's no family list at all.
And in view of the fact that the oldest man with evidence was 122 years old, Muslim age seems to be extremely uncertain.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulaj.
This man was probably three times his wife and had 23 children. At 136 years of age, he still had a daughter.
So, did Shirali Muslims fail to live up to his age for a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, director general of Maxe Plancka Institute in Rostock, has also heard of people flying in Central Asia.
"Even in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunz Valley in Pakistan," Scholz says, "there are also very many very old men living in Sardinia."
However, there is no scientific evidence of age, especially when mothers are missing.
Each day of the solution of dissolved butter
In fact, people around Lerik often experience the Bible’s age.
At present, there are 20 people older than 100 years of age.
So why does he live here in the south with so many flying people?
Azerbaijani director Farid Mujimzadeh explains this to the special genes of the Talish.
The director of the Museum of Fatuljeva, on the other hand, believes that it begins in life.
However, the very caloric soil of Talish people who love meat, bread and especially milk products and many of them drink dissolved butter daily is so healthy that from a bromatological point of view it doesn't seem quite likely.
Or is it the original way of life that sustains young people? In Cengemiran, a small village near Lerik, living in Rubaba Mirzayev.
At 97 years of age he is still relatively young in this landscape.
Mirzajeva, who claims to have 143 generations, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He's sitting on the ground with a moustache that he's not exactly swimming.
Under one roof there live eight people, except one of Mirzay's sons and daughter, both of whom have been grandparents for a long time.
There's two little kids waiting around.
In the kitchen, a tea is prepared for guests, which is given in the typical "armad"
The white teeth of Mirzaj are made up of perfect order and under the hat are covered with a long dark blonde copy that reveals her son in front of us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they didn't look like me and they kept their color.
"I never used the shampoo either," says Mirzaev.
The monthly allowance for life is sufficient
She always ate only what came from her own court, raccoons, drums, games.
For the rest of my life, I never bought food in the supermarket.
Then she'll tell me about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was the second world war.
But everything improved when he took over the "loved father" Geedar Aliev.
The propaganda sounds strange to an old woman's mouth.
However, the cult surrounding the positions of the father of the nations who ruled his country as dictator in Azerbaijan is unknown.
He was in power by 2003 and then took over his son Ilham.
At least the old people in Azerbaijan don't need to be patient.
Mirzaeva receives a monthly income of 230 minutes (about the same amount in euro). This is to a greater extent the amount of income that can be used well.
And perhaps he has the truth of the long-standing son of Mirzay: "Old people live in our culture of great importance."
They live in the midst of big families, they are loved, cared for, and happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive any minute
The concept of "human rights" in the Constitution is missing
The revolution returned to Kahiri.
Undisclosed demonstrations in Cairo have revealed a deep fulfillment of the country.
The matter is discussed carefully about the future constitution based on the law of charm.
The Egyptian president didn't kill the patho.
We need to create a transition.
"And because it's going to happen to us, I'm responsible, before people and before God," he said on state television.
His words were directed to the whole nation, especially to Christian Coptics, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular peoples.
You're all still hopelessly facing opposition, but they're scared.
Fear before "God's State" on the Nile, issued on behalf of a strong Muslim brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologized that he had previously restricted the competence of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own so as to "save the revolution".
However, the 61-year-old engineer who has the title of a doctor at the U.S. University of Southern California really wants to save, and there are no Egyptian or the world clearly.
Is justice to be free of power?
The 234 paragraphs that the constitutional association with the movement of Islam quickly adopted in the 15-hour night marathon are partly due to concern.
As in previous constitutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principal" mean?
It was and is the point of explanation and it can be feared that Islamists use this unclear formula and the related legal space free space for more precise interpretation of the Shari.
At least this is highlighted in the new added paragraph: In all matters relating to Shari, it is necessary to consult the University of Al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a major impact on the entire Sunni Islam.
This does not have to be done, but it can mean that the clergy will exercise control over the law, which would bring justice to an actual right.
Many things are explained in the proposal of the Constitution
The problem is also that civil rights of military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served for Mubarak's government to put an end to the opposition.
After the fall of dictatorship, there were up to 11,000 civilians in military relations.
As proposed, the state should also protect "the right foundation of the Egyptian family and support its moral and values".
This is so clearly expressed on the legal page that by means of this paragraph State institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
It doesn't mean anything else than a centenary.
Finally, no paragraph shall be explicitly limited to the explicit equality of men and women.
Therefore, another paragraph prohibits Hanoi or talking to the prophet Mohammed and his envoy.
But the mystery remains what is chaos and how it will be achieved.
In the same way, there is no doubt about the formulation that "man-to-face" is prohibited.
Is there enough in this case already a presidential cartoon or a joke on the account of lawmakers?
For an explanation, as much as much else in this proposal, which Murzy proposes to sign and, according to his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of human vote.
"The revolution's back"
For a few weeks, opposition has taken place against the overcrowding of Islamists.
Tens of people gathered at Tahrír in Kahari on Friday evening in an unusual alliance and agreed to destroy the constitutional document before it began to pay.
"The revolution has come back and we're winning," said Hamdin Sabbáí, who was placed in presidential elections in third place.
The Nobel Prize holder and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradej announced that the draft constitution belongs to "the centre of history".
Through the short news service Twitter accused Mursi's companies of wanting to carry out "the fight against democracy".
"If he reports a referendum, we'll go to his palace and bury him," said the opposition officer Jasir Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been shed," quoted the Egyptian opposition policy media Chalida Aliho.
Several judges announced that they did not want to look at a referendum that would be free of charge.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
A well-organized Muslim brotherhood declared an atmosphere demonstration, however, never in the town of Tahrír, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile before the Kahari University.
She was attended by many married women and salfists who called out: "People demand the application of God's law."
They said to the Marium: "Purify the earth!" and they were in safety: "This is our meeting."
The battle of integrity over the symbolic city of Tahrír, where everything began, was likely to trigger a similar civil war.
Mursey's friends obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim brotherhood declared that the opposition and the rest of the proposal were voiced and clearly expressed.
Now it's time to let people in the electoral offices decide which direction the country should go.
Most of the Islamic proposals are considered to be positive.
"The word 'human rights' does not appear at all."
A constitutional dispute that should actually continue until the end and integrate all the social forces is resolved by Háfize Abu Sa'du.
The 18-year-old human rights defender and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) called on members of the Muslim brotherhood when they were imprisoned or in court.
Not because he would share their ideology, but because human rights are inseparable to him.
He was beaten, sentenced and imprisoned for it.
"And now in the new constitution there are no words 'human rights' at all," she complains in the talk for "Welt am Sontag".
The forced expansion of power on all three power components in the State has brought this right to withdrawal.
These measures are a scandalous accusation against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the president of civil society, he actually broke it," Sa'da complains.
However, without civil society organisations, democracy cannot function.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community, which follows the game of ideological factions on the Nile with mixed awareness and pressure.
That could happen to him.

Norwegian rakfik: The world's most fishing fish?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of life in Europe, but even in the world.
Could the secrets of the country's success be linked to the local appetite for highly pollutant fish?
Take a couple of transparent cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a bunch of spinal and wet football equipment.
Let me lie down for a week.
So you get those who are paralysing raccoons, one of the biggest Norwegian delicates.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
There's snow here, a beautiful view - and there's plenty of fun in the air.
Rakfisk is a sand-stained bird trapped in water for up to one year - depends on how much you want fish to swim.
As it gets cold and becomes cold, Norr's here in Fagernes is starting to be at a festival dedicated to the way I say it's the best, most memorable food.
"You're dreaming of it raw and then you're drinking it with a glass of water," says Howard Halvarsen, a local professional cook, but also known as "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival.
People eat small fish bones around us and drink them a lot of alcohol.
"Some people prefer to water more than rape," Havard says.
A drink can be passed through.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not that bad - it's the same taste of sushi that was on the long road by bus.
Rakfisk is a very different product during the time when there was poverty in Norway and since there were no refrigerators, fish were gathered on the floor to airstrips with water and salt.
Then, in the midst of the winter, when they were well exhausted, they pulled out and ate - meanings undoubtedly got drunk with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and seek employment, most of which had emigrated to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% make immigrants attractive to a large amount of work, high education and a comprehensive care system.
The people of Sweden, an old river that was still much richer than Norway, are moving into the country for work.
It is seen as something important, indistinguishable, even though relatively disturbing part of the Norwegian past.
They're part of the most expensive food on the market.
Even if it's all expensive - small beer or sandwiches will get you 9 free ($14) for lunch.
Norway does not often receive global reports, and it seems that most citizens do.
The name of Anders Breivek, a true racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, here people are still missing.
Instead, the shooting is called "the accident of 22 July".
Norse can only be hard to believe that in their peaceful land, one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
With the current wealth of Norway, the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries since the beginning of the 70th century is on the rise.
"But the rose is not the only reason why it gives us so much good," she says, when giving us Tallers with a handcuff of our white Anna, which with its long blond hair and surprisingly blue eyes represents the prototype of Nordic beauty.
We're, like you're told, people take care of us.
Her English, like the English of most people in the world, is completely out of order.
We don't pretend, we don't like showing up.
Norway is under the control of its slave wealth very carefully - except for a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund for the future generation.
When all the others in the years leading to the global financial crisis distributed money that they did not have, the Norses were firmly rooted in their place.
"As long as we can lie in the winter and go on vacation, we're happy," says Anna.
"And eat raccoon," adds with an old smile.
I'm standing in the snow in front of something to eat. I've got enough beef already.
Such a lot of burger is definitely something else and it's beautiful.
But tonight's an exciting fish back here.
The hotel I live in is one of the many places where you take a taxi to dinner and where guests like the best, or more for whose most annual fish.
They're connected to a live television transmission in which the modulator with a motor-contained plate is attached to a rackfish.
It's like a Eurovision song competition.
"What shoes do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"There's our wedding here, Howard."
It's called a joke and a joke.
A man with a seat falls, maybe with aquavit.
Or maybe some of these fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take over the office, Will Grant from BBC is looking for the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his people.
Transport in Mexico City is particularly bad at present.
In the city that has been captured even during these best times, there have been obsessive blockades closing several key routes into the main city and causing road chaos.
The aim, however, was not to prevent those coming in to get to work but to prevent protesters from accessing Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto will hold the presidential Sherpa and will take over the leadership of the nation.
They're in charge.
Mexico has led a good economy during the administration of the decommissioning Felipe Calderona, but the country has been in the ranks of drug wars that have already taken 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to reducing violence against the Mexican people," said President Pen Nieto of the United States President Barack Obama of Oval, working at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before he gave his hand to the American president, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as governor of his home state in Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old territory, the people and the scattered state of the capital.
A real man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo they remember him well.
Its citizens contribute to the development of tourism in aviation and infrastructure.
You can now get to the city one of the new roads that Pena Nieto left to build. These are a huge improvement in the range of the wooden and rough roads that were here before.
Disks with his name also depend on the walls of modern sports centre and impressive interactive museum with climate change theme.
"We expect it to bring about real and lasting change," said friend and political associate Gabriel Olver Hernandez, Member of State by President Pena Nieta, Party of the institutionalised revolution (PRI).
In particular, we hope for an interesting and real change in the area of security and the economy that our country so needs.
After 81 years of uninterrupted operation, the PRI party was released by Vicent Foxe.
Ambassador Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, many people are expecting an Enrique Pena Nieta.
And he refuses to express opposition that characterizes the new president as a person without the essential content.
He's a very friendly person, very busy with an extraordinary vision of the country.
He's a great statesman, and he's mostly a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not an idea that has many people from its former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad Neza, there can be no contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo.
Situated under the long distances, many people remember the capital city of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the self-regulated city are sustainable and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was invited to help manage the drug gangs operating in the fourth, especially with the fingertips of violence against women.
Only in the last two years have been in the deserts near huge waste dumps of the bodies of murdered women.
At the time that Pena Nieto was a governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in Mexico City, which is much more than in the city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous for the murder of innocent women.
In a better case, the critic of Pena Nieta says that when he moved to the office, he lived in an adequate shelter with the problem of killing women.
And in the worst case, his conduct is due to the closure of his eyes.
In the concrete house, typical for the fourth quarter, Irene Buddia shows me pictures of her pregnant daughter, Mariany Luny, and she's crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I got into her house, it seemed like someone had lost her body," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of post-nutrition signs on him, and death had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross on which she is the only word "justice".
However, this is exactly what the family says, exactly what they were told.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old bitch, a bully and a princess.
They want you to just accept what they say and remain silent.
"But it can't be right when it comes to making mistakes and forgetting," she says.
The Sherpa, held by President Pen Nieto on Saturday, is entrusted with great responsibility.
In the last six years, dozens of families in Mexico have been subjected to violent crime, and the new president has promised that after his action in the office, his priority will be given.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was a governor," says Ambassador PRI Olver in Valle del Bravo.
But that's exactly what families of victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about the wrong behaviour, says the military prosecutor.
The military prosecutor is trying to reverse Bradley Manning's claim regarding gross conduct in the relationship.
The hearing is about Manning's being in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
Obababa wants the case to be dismissed on the basis of cruel treatment of Manning in prison.
The war is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that the army of Bradley Manning, who is accused of the greatest avoidance of secret material in the history of the United States, has missed many opportunities to complain about the harsh behavior he has endured in military relations.
The military prosecutor of May. Ashden Fein, at the crossing hearing of the Manning War at the front hearing in Ft. Maede in Maryland, said that records of weekly visits that Manning had with officials of units during nine months of contact with Quanticu in Virginia showed no difficulties in misconduct.
The cross-examination which occurred during the hearing of the motion for appeal would prevent the case against Manning from being brought against him because of the cruel conduct in the time of the relationship which he was self-evident of himself, passed on the day after Manning testified that he considered himself to be a suicide.
The military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At the fifth hearing, military prosecutor Fein went along with Manning, who, after meeting with Manning in the federal prison in Quanticu, had been detained in the form of an increased threat from July 2010 to June 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday about these forms, Manning admitted that the behaviour of his guards was "exacting" and the overall behaviour of the device was "very professional".
The formulae show no difficulties in dealing with wrong behavior, even though the officials of Manning asked directly how he was treated, Fein said.
Manning replied that the concerns relating to the various problems were expressed orally and that the officials who visited her spoke to him about these concerns and pointed out that they would remain, however, these problems were not recorded.
"They wrote "no problems" (after they discussed concerns), and it didn't have to mean that I didn't mention them," said Manning.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain to his staff in January 2011 during a meeting with the commission of suicides which he had expressed several months earlier in the form.
Manning replied that during this meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "prevention against injury" regime.
The army indicated that it used this restrictive regime (one step under supervision because of suicide) for its protection and security of others.
"I wanted the observers in the relationship to know that I'm okay and that I wanted to cancel this regime of prevention of injury... so I could enjoy the increased quality of life as I saw it here," said Manning.
On Thursday, Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and transport to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before he was transferred to a prison on the basis of sea crossings in Quanticu in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait, and once for the sake of the heat he cleaned up.
He indicated that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what would happen to him in the world was very appealing.
"My world died only on the basis of Arifdjan, on this guy," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that shithole.
Manning pointed out that after arriving in Quantica he spent most of the day (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in small areas without any company.
Manning said he was allowed to have only one matrice, cover, gloves, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because he was sleeping or just lying around against the rules during the day.
Manning said he'd always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He indicated that if the guards could not see his face when he turned around on the other side of the night, they would wake him up and have to come back.
Manning's legal representative made formal difficulties in dealing with the Manning War in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned the charges raised in the fourth hearing concerning the fact that after one night of his entire night in Quantico, he was also forced to stand before the guards and other relatives at the early count.
Manning said he wasn't allowed to hide his cover when he was counted.
At the fifth hearing, Judge Manning announced that he had found out from the order of his guards that he had a cover which he could hide, but admitted that no one had ordered him to surrender.
On Thursday Manning said he had been forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to prove to the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning told the officer he could use the money from his basement or his calls to get hurt, but he didn't.
Manning said that this night his body was removed from his backyard, his calls and glasses.
His legal representative hopes that he will take his experience from his prison experience and that his testimony before the military court, which is expected to begin in the beginning of the following year, will significantly reduce his punishment.
Obabaja said he was planning to admit Manning to guilt in lower criminal acts and to fight against other charges because they are too extreme.
The start of the hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will appeal to the conditions of detention as justified.
The Pentagon reported that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions relating to all detained persons in connection with the maximum security.
The charges against Manning include assistance from enemies, unlawful publication of online reporting documents, the transfer of information on national security and the stealing of public property or records.
If he is charged in all points, he can be sentenced to life.
My crisis in Mexico-American identity
He says that many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient possibilities they are there.
The Mexicans are supposed to blame those who left; they remind them of difficult times, they say.
Navarret says that Mexican Americans are a lavender between the two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital city of Mexico, I almost passed the tax and arrived at the place for an immigrant agenda where I found myself in trouble.
The chips pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexico" ("Mexico") and the other for "Extrajeros" ("Cinci").
I stayed there for a few seconds and I didn't know where I was going.
I grew up in central California and I've been called "Mexico" all my life.
It's an ethnic short, just like my friends in Boston call "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italian".
So I'm done with the term "Mexico American" later.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need to use shorts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish. I'm good enough to manage both sides of the conversation in this language.
However, I don't have a dictionary of the native language and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I took out my American passport and put myself in front of "Extraneros".
I was thinking about the time this week when new elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House of President Obama.
The programme had common concerns when leaders from these two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about growth in the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is equally likely that Mexicans will remain in Mexico as they travel to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue in the fight against drug cartels, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complex and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and brought its leader under the threat of weapons to over half of the Mexican territory in the United States.
But for Mexicans who think around the clock, not for a minute, the memories are universal.
So one minute after the representative of the United States says something a little critical about Mexico, you hear in Mexico's press and between the elite of difficulties about how Americans are entering into the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezumy are on a war path.
And yet, for Mexico, that is a real development of relations with more than 35 million Mexicans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico there are winners and winners, people who offer opportunities, and others who don't.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that in some of our family trees there was a person, perhaps a parent or a relative who had an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it may seem, this person has responded to the profile - dark skin, poor education, the origin of poor neighborhoods, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And even though we live in an American dream now, we go to good school and we have a good job, we can never forget that we live in an American dream, not a Mexican dream.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
And yet we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and look at us as an inferior race that is not quite Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our route to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is based on their view of seduction.
If our families hadn't settled in Mexico, they'd never have left it.
And now we wouldn't be trapped by a vicious attack, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who had legal access to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexico and Mexico, because Mexico has more understanding of who they are, and Mexican Americans don't.
Although he is a citizen of the United States, he sees himself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like a part of.
We love the Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springstein.
You get the best out of both countries, but you don't even have any roots.
In Mexico he looks at us like America.
And in the United States we are considered to be Mexico.
And to make relationships more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence want to connect again with the diaspora, as I learned on my trip.
They want Mexicans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American citizens how great it is to visit this country and press on the political leader to strengthen relations with Mexico.
No, no, no.
That's not gonna happen.
You're getting too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to the inequality of income and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I feel like it's on you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not willing to leave the United States the way they dealt with Mexico a year and a half ago, it must be accepted that some Mexicans still do not feel the way their family members were treated in the near past.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The end of the conflict between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain foundation for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between the Arab and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another cycle of bleeding means that every such incident is fatal.
Among the usual remaining agreements about who started this, many buildings were transformed into bridges, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis. The first came rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though it seems that the Israelites and the Palestinians have been involved in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab hierarchy changed the old order and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they liked it or not, were caught in a recent chaos in the region.
Maybe it'll make their fight more bloodier than before.
However, there are reasons to think that this may end their dying condition.
A war that is neither won nor won.
At first glance, there seems to be no reason for optimism at present.
Even if the ceasefire ended on 21 November, the fighting took place on both sides of this week.
The leaders of Hamas, an Islamic coup that has been in Gaza since 2007, will claim to have led the Israelites into entry, even though Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite killing a number of Hamas leaders and closing 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most tragic and most lethal places on earth, Israel did not allow Hamas to be destroyed.
And actually, Hamas is having an impact on the West Coast, another taste of Palestine, which is currently being ruled by its raging rivals from Fatahu, a more moderate Palestinian group.
In addition, leaders of Hamas can be very good at arguing that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world have gained greater influence, so Hamas has gained strong and rich friends.
Turkey, once again renewed regional power, which was Israel’s closest Muslim alliance, joined the Hamas side. Likewise, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in Zaliv.
People from Hamas say that the Islamic half-month is buried around Israel, north of Lebanon, where the ruling party/milicy of Hizballah, across Syria, where the rebels, who are becoming more and more tolerant of Islam, can sit in Bashar Asad, and beyond the Jordan, where Hamas' allies threaten the king.
And above all, on the south coast of Israel, the rise of the Muslim brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, far from the most friendly and sensitive Arab country in the region.
Husní Mubarak, a secular island who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is Brother Hamas and its leaders are more influential by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can appear as a player who cannot be excluded from either Israel or America.
On the contrary, the Israeli residents of the hard line will come to the wrong conclusion.
Hamas was put back in the military term.
The Israeli anti-locking system of the Iron Coal proved its price and many Hamas rockets were destroyed.
The Israelites could sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as non-violent as always. Many European countries also won Hamas from the beginning of the last cycle of violence.
Above all, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the president of the government who largely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets in Gaza killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, in Israel were relatively calm from suicide bombers, thanks to the wall that enters the West Bank, the main part of what might once be a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite their opposition to international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose side of Likud at the beginning of the campaign to the election of the late 22nd January, joined the more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why are these Palestinians deceived by giving them their own state?
If they were really ruling on the west coast, wouldn't they have fired rockets like their finals in Gaza?
It'll be better if we keep them behind this wall and we'll dump them when they're out of their heads.
Perhaps the residents win the hard line, but the Arab yard can change their plans.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not love Israel too much, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defence costs are higher than all its four Arab neighbours.
The start of a new war with local superpowers will help the new Arab government to heal its economy.
The fact that President Murzy worked with President Barack Obama to achieve the stop of the fire is a good sign and can mean the beginning of something new.
The Israelites should also look at the situation from a long perspective.
While the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, it creates a violation of Palestinians' right to self-defence of the courts with a gun which must one day be fired in the areas occupied by Israel - just like a bus that blew up in Tel Aviv last week.
In the current period of repression, there has been a weakening of democracy in the Jewish state, and the demographic situation continues to worsen as the Arab population grows.
Blood spills against Gaza every few years for Hamas to be pressed will be more and more choosing diplomatic tax.
Both sides need bids outside.
The answer is what wise people say on both sides, most of the outside world and these newspapers: two states when Israel enters the land for security reasons.
In the short term, there is a little hope that stopping the smoke will give pressure from the outside at least a little more impact on the spread of this thing.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, has to stop supplying weapons to Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the opinion of the Jewish State based on the 1967 border with the exchange of parts of the country and shared by Jerusalem.
The Arab savages must also press on the deal between Hamas and Fatah.
This would have done more than an immediate offer to create a Palestinian state of virtual state sovereignty in the UN.
President Obama also has a role to play on how to get Israel to the governing table.
During his first electoral period, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems to be equally impressed by his entry into the process.
It's unfortunately short-lived.
America has a vital interest in the stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful comparison between Israel and Palestine.
In Australia they entered into force laws on toxic cigarettes
Warnings for chickens and sick parts of the body are displayed on non-slip green cramps that are the same for all tobacco signs.
Australia's laws on harmful tobacco and cigarettes, their first type of world, and logos and colors have been replaced by general olive green cramps with graphic images of the sick parts of the body and by showing children and newborns suffering from the smoking of their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and images, Saturday is the only difference between the signs of characters printed in the same small letter.
It's the closest way to the world of tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to get young people out of smoking because this crime will free him of his addiction.
It depends on studies that show that if people don't start smoking by the age of 26, it's 99% chance they never start smoking.
"And for very young children you can see that he understands the relationship that tobacco companies are trying to sell together with his product," says the Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek and cites studies that have shown that children are connected to the school in order to be a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest number of smokers in the world and changes will have only a small impact on the profits of international companies, other countries consider taking similar steps.
The tobacco industry has been heavily lobbying against the introduction of these laws.
The tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase trade on the black market, leading to easier and more accessible cigarettes.
"This legislation will lead to serious consequences," says Scott McIntyre from British American Tobacco Australia.
China and Indonesia will bring many more products that will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their trade.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarettes from silicone serving to cover unwanted cracks, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost its appeal to the highest court in Australia, increased almost zero sales.
Ha stated that Zico sold nearly 6,000 pieces to wholesalers and expected new resources.
It's a good deal for us.
As far as possible, experts point out the popularity of social media to the demographic group on which the plan is intended.
Throughout the series of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsoring sports events and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes before direct viewing, tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but it cannot limit foreign websites.
"If you're a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you're left with only this small space for the promotion of your products, it's online space for you to be invisibly where you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Ms. Freeman noted an increase in the evaluation of social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook conducted by "measurable Honzoa".
We need to ask ourselves, is it just a private town that really loves Marlboro cigarettes and gave you a job and created this video, or is there a marketing company involved in it?
The UK American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry focused on how it applied to new regulations rather than marketing.
The company went so far as to pay for the attack by Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic - countries within the World Trade Organization declare that trade is unfair, although none of the countries with Australia are significantly unsold.
The implementation of the SOO Decision is expected to be in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has conducted talks with other governments that consider similar laws relating to coastal areas.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory security photographs in 2001.
More than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine, have now expanded.
More stringent laws are considered by Britain, New Zealand, the South African Republic and India.
There's a lot of chicken growing in Australia.
The pictures have no effect on me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"You're just taking off your cigarette and throwing your tie back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a picture of a doll in your mouth.
Honestly, it's just one reason I quit smoking, and it's my little girl.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack traffic in the center of Sydney, says that it's harder for him to get it into the rules.
"It took me one hour to pay my expenses, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we would say, 'OK, it's the end, we'll close the fence'," he said and he cut his hands.
In the world of uninterrupted connection, it's not so bad to be upset
On the last day of thanking me, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So we had a lot of time to think about the nude.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day on the airport for the next year is nicely expensive, even through the distribution of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development are increasingly coming with praise for the promotion.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to offer ourselves at times.
It can lead to interesting guidelines that can support creativity.
And since most of us are still connected to a screen today, we don't have a chance to enjoy nude.
So should we support the nude?
Yes.
Oh, no.
But I'll be right back.
For one thing, like many people, I've assumed that the nude is a relatively new wave that came with more leisure time.
But as Peter Toohey says, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, author of the book Bored: A Level History (History nudy) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, there's a long history," he said.
A Latin inscription on the walls of Pompeii was found from the first century C.E.
And then it's also a question of how we define the nude.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After considering research literature and the presentation of the opinion of the target group about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the nude as "I wanted to do something that would calm me down, but I wasn't able to do it."
The nuda is different from the patia because the person's not involved in anything, but she'd like to be.
He says there's no urge to do anything about it.
He says that nuclear nude is "the destruction of the process of attention associated with a bad mood and a sense of slowing down in time."
Nuda can remember a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a mutual relationship, people tend to see a problem like the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see a problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're getting excited when we're just having trouble focusing on it.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Board in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment by which participants listened to the tape on which the person read an article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and non-binding TV program in behind rooms, others heard it so quietly that they noticed it, while the third group did not even hear it.
Those who heard the TV program calmed down, reported more nude than the other two groups - had problems with focus, but were not sure why and signed these problems.
When you are trying to focus on a difficult or challenging task, you can get attention to the nude, says Mark J. Fenska, professor of neurology at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "such as looking for bad parts on the factory line, it can trigger music to help you stop. "
In fact, he said, we now know that the bending and blinking that is often seen as a sign of the nude can actually help with the offer to fight and keep people physically more alert.
"The study shows that children who are allowed to return are learning more and retaining more information than those who are forced to sit quietly," said Professor Fenska.
We've all experienced a disaster - my flight's delay, a heavy player, especially a long-term film.
But some individuals have more chance to offer themselves than others.
In the 1980 ’ s, scientists developed "Bored Proneness Scale" to help measure the nude.
The score includes questions like: "Many things I have to do are repeated and they are monotonous," and "I have so much interest that I don't have time to do them all."
With these degrees scientists have found that boys tend to offer themselves more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and especially when it comes to having more and different external incentives.
However, teenagers are generally not accurate.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 per cent of those attending indicated that they were offered at school and at home, while 23 per cent indicated that they were offered when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were offering.
Professor Larson said he doesn't know whether the nude percentage would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said that he knows that "sing is a time of emergency," which is to a large extent due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is nada good for you?"
As research shows, sometimes no, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take an absurd physical risk, to play gambling games or to abuse conventional substances as a way to calm it down.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between the universe and creation, said Professor Vodanov, who had studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Nada is a way of thinking how to tell you you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology on NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing you should do here.
If you offer and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, you will be happy.
But if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not for a long time.
So if your child offers himself and you give him iPad, he won't offer himself any more, but he doesn't learn how to have fun or to manage on his own, Professor Fenska said.
And "This self-control is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child learns not only how to have fun but also how to develop greater self - control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate Christmas.
But we shouldn't even be too critical against her.
Our goal should be to feel more comfortable when we reach a steady pace of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of the need to offer more, but the nuda is sick, unsatisfied to be connected with something meaningful," he said.
What people are really looking for, he said, is how to relax and enjoy free time.
"In an environment where we're constantly being overstimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to have fun when the noise goes away."
There is no manual on the new marijuana law in Colorado.
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student at high school and footballist from South-East Colorado, is accused of criminal acts for something that will soon happen in the entire state of law - for holding several grams of marijuana and drugs that he used to smoke.
Mr. Orozco said one summer day he had a couple of friends in Lamar on the beach near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After the police found him in Marihuan's car, Mr. Orozco was summoned to hold drugs and equipment for drug use - minor offences where he was charged with $100 per account - and a court date was set for him.
"Look at us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks following a coloured vote on the legalization of the small number of marijuana for recreational use, the answer depends on hundreds of fewer drug cases than the law.
The number of cases of marijuana arrests has already been dropped here and in Washington, where similar measures have been adopted.
The police department has ceased to charge adults aged 21 and older for keeping a small number legally permitted after the law enters into force in the following weeks.
But applicants in more conservative areas of Colorado have announced that they will continue with existing cases involving marijuana and continue to accuse people of being held.
At the same time, several cities from the city of Denver, heading west, vote for the ban on the opening of new licensed marijuana shops in their municipalities.
"This business develops so fast that I don't know what's going on," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Heads of staff and regulators in Washington State.
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a licensing system for seed, production, distribution and sale - all by 1 December 2013.
It is said that Colorado, either in good or in bad, is in front of most states in the marijuana regulation, first for medical use and now also for recreation.
"Corado has a more regulated market, so he will be a good leader," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the licensing of the sale of alcohol in Washington State.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what could work.
"There is no real precedent that we could manage," he said.
The Washington Act, called I-502, takes effect on 6 December, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there will be no state licensing system, but legal detention.
And there are complex mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, such as the assessment of the State's "relevant approach" guidelines for licensed marijuana with its prohibition of trade with rabbits up to 330 metres from school, parks, children's playgrounds or children's facilities.
"It will never be more difficult to place licensed trade with rabbits than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Centre for Legal Coupons, recently founded research groups.
On 21 November, police chief Oates sent his e-mail to the city of Aurora, informing them that the city's complainant will no longer be subjected to the arrest of a small number of marijuanas at every 21-year-old town and that the police "with immediate force" will stop accusing people of these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police would pass on the city laws regulating medical marijuana guns and that they would continue to arrest drug dealers and dealers.
In the Weld period in northern Colorado, the Ken Buck District Prosecutor presents a more thorough view.
After the vote, he announced that his office would continue to deal with cases of marijuana detention, mostly as a way to press users to seek treatment.
At the present time, 56 grams or less of marijuana are charged with 119 people, although many of them are charged with other charges.
"Our authority is obliged to shut down the criminal charges which were criminal acts at the time they came to him," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The reactions were also complex in places, such as the foreign period of Mesa, where lovers rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the period, is now no longer charged with holding a small number.
The District Prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided not to deny all ongoing detention cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing in law enforcement until it changes," he said.
Although 55% of the colouring voters supported the measure, the introduction of recreational marijuana into the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And the opposite response against the state has seen this great state-wide green experiment of deep satisfaction between local officials.
For the prosecutors, it's a "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a law lawyer from Denver, who is a lawyer charged with the arrest of marijuana, and a local spokesman of the National Law Reform Organization for marijuana.
"They have spent so much of their lives trying to reach people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to which the small number of marijuana is regarded as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best path to becoming a national drug law test case.
Prosecutors and state authorities are planning new boundaries for legalized sales and are currently eagerly awaiting guidance from the federal government which is still planning to consider the sale and prosecution of marijuana for federal crimes.
Lawyers of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will double.
Despite several arrests by marijuana vendors for medical purposes and patients who took care of it, the majority of the federal government has left business with marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While anti-drug agents will probably not open the door to catch a small drug bag, it is likely that the State will be able to reverse the possibility of regulated trading with the recreational marijuana approved by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former adviser to the anti-drug policy of President Obama.
Several colorful cities are not waiting for federal authorities.
Before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new deal with marijuana, even though it will take about a year before any trade will be opened.
Last week, the city of Montrose proposed a half-year ban on the west of the state and it is likely that next week it will enter into force.
"We don't want to get into a situation when we give someone a license and then we'll have a lot of federal business," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our owner voted against this addition.
We're looking at what the owner voted for, against what he voted for.
There's really a lot of questions here.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was brought to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
In their view, only today's university students are attacked.
I don't remember ever having a study at Oxford University.
Like my father, my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world's biggest science sitter, a modern, accused Greek symposium that motivated two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And while I was at the end of the twentieth century two weeks after I moved to the Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I dropped my suitcases and returned to my first life scandal.
My father was crying and crying.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard daily said I gave it up because I had plans against the love of students in the back room.
Writer A. N. Wilson publicly declared that I was leaving because I was forced to drink from the broken trunks.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was a subject of systematic scan and intimidation.
Not because of my kind of weird name or the fact that I came from private schools.
I was chased for the sole reason and in this cycle of thought enlightenment it was as big as barbaric: my father, married Woodrow Wyatt, was highly appointed by the consultant Margaret Thatcher and I as Conservative Party.
You can ask yourself why I'm doing this until now.
Just because the latest reports indicate that the new generation of students is right from the middle of it with similar consequences.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students sought the same protection of equal rights as gays, health professionals and ethnic minorities.
The Conservative Group of Young People (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College states that because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and are informed that they are not welcome".
They call for the creation of a position in the university committee for equal opportunities to ensure that their views can be presented freely.
Their situation did not help even the recently mentioned BBC Two documentary series entitled Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Possible Country: Youth, Intelligent and Right) on student political action, which the conservative has treated as a wonder and non-racist.
In order was presented by an absolute Joe Cooke, former president of Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who was driving Rolls-Roycem, dressed in a silver dress and had hair with a silver head.
In other high schools, conservative students say they are treated as " Victim Baracks" because of the introduction of a higher school.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President Nottingham University Conservative Association (Conservative Association of Nottingham University), told reporters that "left impact on universities is growing.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without even meeting with us."
Eleven-year-old historian of Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who stand behind the urge for greater protection, says that such a climate is "admissive", while 19th-century elected President of OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that the JCR members have been directly brought to an end.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the good living conditions of members," she says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I grew up in September 1986, 18 years old and protectively shy.
Hate against the Conservative Party was the hottest.
A year ago, the university rejected the grant of an honorary title given by former student Margaret Thatcher because of the losses in the funding of high school.
From the atmosphere, the constants would also be worried.
During the first few days of the initial week when the new students were dealing with each other and with the professors, I was able to taste the chicken that he was supposed to come.
I found out that not only doll teachers approve of condominative jokes, but they also feel involved.
The policy of strict stand, privatization and support of the government against apartheid sanctions in the South African Republic was introduced into the forest.
My first presentation was about the translation of the French text from the 18th century into English and what followed, I was not prepared.
"Mister Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt.
I've had enough of that.
Professor Pitt, a little man with his face like a dorsal body, was very hurt.
"They refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students left.
To my eyes, the tears came out.
"I propose that you take some basic French lessons in your leisure time, so if you are not too busy with social affairs," Professor Pitt concluded.
I'm so excited I'm back in my room.
I was sitting alone at school at dinner when I felt a little bit down on my shoulder.
He was a student of the second anniversary of James, who was represented as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said strangely.
I'm sorry.
Anyone who is suspected of conservativeism is meant.
It's too bad for me, but he knows your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most of the condoms assume they're labists.
Later in the local house, I tried to pretend.
I kept saying I didn't agree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick seemed like a failure.
A student of the first year of the philosophy, politics and economy that (a strong irony) went to Eton said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're under orders.
The other students were on their way with him.
I've been back, spinal.
"How do condoms love?" asked one.
They're dating each other, aren't they?
I felt like they had to feel gay before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever have a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to deal with people who think like this only after they're born?
Should I change into a lab and put my natural clothes on?
Three years ago, I was developed as a cleaner of ignorance and isolation.
The only conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who lived at my college.
He was hated not only because he is conservative but also because he's an adviser to Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy and one of those who write statements to her.
He wasn't almost there.
He hated this place for his province and for his example of Marxist-Deterministic view of history.
In 1997 he attended a professor at the University of Bilkent in Turkish Ankara.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started going from Oxford to my parents' home in London, looking for shelter in my busy metropolis friends and family.
I told my dad that I hate Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his four-year study at Oxford, all political views were adopted.
"But it's really the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of sleep.
Even my communist friends always had perfect ways.
His blind eyes were smiling.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
The frequent journeys to London have deteriorated my citadel's resistance.
My friend, as well as the conservative party, dropped the pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week during the course of the study, when another professor of history declared that I was "a human enemy", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was in the middle of a study, I admitted that "my parents had brain damage" and I called it "old crazy."
It was just a short time ago.
My father was kidnapped by a robbery in my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns every week in Murdoch's newspapers.
My door was locked.
I got baptized inside, and after five minutes my followers gave it up.
When they left, I dropped my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I've never come back.
You can call me a dirty weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be in the educational institution of such fear and greed.
Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, from which not only came 14 conservative primers, but also hidden today as undeserved stories of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino has more elegance than fame."
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of fashion", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke with Naty Abascalov, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisso and other famous Italian designers.
Somerset House, an old residence of Isabely I. English, is the only place in the British capital to welcome the exhibition of Valentina Garavani.
The speaker confirmed this at the beginning of the famous retrospective "Valentino: master fashion design", which represents more than 130 models of superior methods created by his workshop over the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," it says with its irreplaceable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story where "il Signor" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not be written without his precious clients.
Valentino has always felt angered by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first exhibition hall, which will last until March 3rd, is covered by a private correspondence and photographs with the signatures of the most famous sleektics, from Princess Salimy Aga Chan through the Greek Princess Marii-Cantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino presents these personal memories as the trophies of his social upbringing: from the simple crater from Voghera to the north of Italy to the idol of the international "bohemic munitions".
It's not bad to have a royal family.
"They're at least not a piece of cigarettes into a great envelope, as some beautiful pop-music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an effective host and guests play with ease and elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his chat in Gstada," explains Hisssen's ex-wife "Heiniho" and a close friend of forgotten beauty like Marella Agnelí or Eugene Niarchos.
"Valentino always had more elegance than fame.
And yet there is a star from him."
Valeria Mazzová is the president of Valentina
The charisma of the proposal does not even mention the Argentinian model Valeria Mazzová.
"It's been many years since we were a single visitor to Piazza di Spain in Rome at dinner.
We were 20 and there were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy younger.
In every detail of his apartment, beauty, food, music, in everything, he was moved and felt his spirit.
All the calls made by him could feel the importance and love," recalls the top model that began working with him during the Paris Week.
"It will never come out of fashion because its proposals are artistic works," she concludes.
A review of pregnancy
A saved life is not a story of an inheritance, although it is a fact of repeated love.
He loves people with good manners and better titles and they love him.
One of the Somerset House's gallery was stopped at a personal 70-metre-long pass that offers a change of role: a visitor changes to the model and walks through the passage to observe Valentine's mysterious work as a dress chosen by Jackie Kennedy at his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a costume that had Monica Vitti's "night", or a bath of wool and leather that belonged to Caesar Farah Diba.
In the public, manicure is named Sibilla Lucemburská, Gloria from Thurn and Taxisu, Mette-Marit Norská, Rosario Bulharská or Sophie Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentine's Day is like the first love to forget about it.
"I remember it perfectly.
These were calhotes, shirts, gillette clothes and a collection of submersibles from 1971-1972.
It was a gift that he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the potter's masquerades.
"I give him the other priority for his feminity and great love for women because he supports our beauty," adds an ex-Feria guide.
"I really like the colors that he uses, that make a lot of sense and give a "dark" face.
Proportions are perfect."
No princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovanpaola d'Arenberg can forget how Valentina first dressed.
When she got up and lived in Italy, she complained about being full-time and having an opportunity to dress one of her evening watches...
She finally arrived at the end of the 1990s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentina for the chance of celebrating my cousin's garden, Prince Edwarda de Ligne.
It was red clothes that had to be dressed with bells, raw animals and uppers without a frame.
It was a dream that became reality," says the widow after Rodrigu d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is flexible to fashion, his passion is temporary," explains the Italian aristocrat whose life runs between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has a set of wedding clothes "very carefully... because the clothes are not just clothes, it's also a memory file they have in them."
"King" mode
The gold mine at Somerset House is Marie-Cantal Miller's wedding dress from her wedding with Paul Greek in 1995.
In order to create these elegant shelves of elephants with all pearls, twelve types of different lands and trains four and a half metres were needed for four and a half months of work and 25 "chole" (as the name of the designer of his own velvet).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authority of the specialized press, these clothes represent the top methods of the 20th century, "to turn customers from high society".
Valentino is now his best example during the year of the elite "savor-étre".
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (highest appointment in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and mentioned by a series of Pure Laws gather as many poets as any of his clients.
"My attention has always attracted his choice, calm, managed and perfect view," admitted Princess D'Arenberg.
"I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with the Count Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was rude, time left him no step."
When the princess says...
The firmest way in the world: wearing cheeses in the Kawah Ijen soup area
For four euros, the Indian soybeans will have their lives and health when 70 kilograms of cheese fall from hard stone steps.
They're people whose jobs are boring, and they're people who work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 climbers who make themselves alive by getting cheese from Kawah Ijen on the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this reason, every day has to stand at the bottom of the crater, where they avoid the sirens from inside the Earth, and when contacting the air, they pass into a stable state.
After raising large blocks of cheese that weigh up to 70 kilograms together, it takes it to the shoulder in two bamboo bags after the hard stone steps.
To the top of the soft, which is 2,386 metres, it is only 250 metres away, but it takes the tired carriers more than 40 minutes to stand at a severe temperature above because they maintain balance and basically consider their steps so that they do not enter and fall into destruction.
He knows that any inconvenience could be a life like it happened to one French tourist who got off Kawah Ijen a year ago.
The hills in Kawah Ijen make five cents per kilogram of cheese that weighs
When they are up, they cross the road around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and they slowly bring heavy bones to the wall that the lower society has put about something below, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
This is the company PT Candi Gngribbi, which is pregnant since 1960 and has never paid its employees more than 662 Indonesian rubies (five cents) per kilogram of cheese.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry because this growth has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of mushrooms, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar white.
"Because we usually carry 70 kilos, we make about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per trip," explains Anton, who usually completes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and finally he's gone, but he can make 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) a day.
Even though it's considered an integral part of the Negede effort, it's a third of what he would do on the field.
"The daily price of the climbers is very high here. For example, for the collection of coffee 15 000 rupees (1,2 eur) per day and for the price of fourteen days is two million rupees (167 eur)," explains the carrier who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a wall.
There he paid 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and work was not so hard, but Anton returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the soybean, which is as convincing as a sire in Indonesia: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
He's got asthma, he's breathing badly, he's always coughing and his eyes are exposed to toxic rain.
In his 27-year-old, Anton three times a day risks his life in Kawah Ijen, whose sire has already begun to choose his tax, although he has face-to-face special mask and glasses.
It has asthma, it's breathing badly, it's always coughing, and its eyes are exposed to toxic gases that stay out of the soup.
It's the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open up a business or study Spanish or French," promises more than an existing English.
This sympathical and intelligent young man brought to trial could be a tourist guide, a cleaner or a receptionist at the hotel, and instead he does the work of the wearer.
He shares a spinal wood hat with other containers and every day rises at two o'clock in the morning, because the cheese does not stop growing at night and its characteristic yellow color changes in the blue and dark.
And through the surrounding darkness, Anto goes into the crater and lights his way through a little light that he has attached to his helmet and bought it for his money.
About 400 wearers pour on the edge of the hair with cheese from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high incomes, the burden of stress due to the slowing of costs has not been eased, nor does it provide carriers working on their own shoes and with such efforts, no equipment.
In fact, they don't even get part of 30 000 rupees (EUR 2.5) from the photograph fee, which together with 15 000 rupees (EUR 1.2) selects natural park observers from tourists who come to take photos of the soup and its human molluscs.
"This work is for profits, not for people," says Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
It can take up to 110 kilos and assures us that it will continue to work as soon as it goes, because it needs money to educate its three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to go to bed, I'm going to die here because the soup was my whole life.
Although the sira burns the throat and lips in the eyes when the wind suddenly turns around and burns up the upper limbs of the bones, they are so strong that none of them complains that they suffer from serious disabilities... but it is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain and wounds caused by bone marrow.
The unaninik who weighs his bone on the back can weigh only 50 pounds in its 53 years.
Each day he and his colleagues release 15 tons of cheese in October, and then three trucks take the hot road between the holes to the warehouse in Tamanzari, 18 miles away.
"I'm not going to go to bed, I'm going to die here because the soup was my whole life," Unaninik declares and opens up a wide mouth in which several teeth are missing.
Of his five sons, he's the oldest, thirty-five-year-old, he's also making cheese.
Time is running out, but the permanent future of one of the most difficult earthquakes in the world lasts from generation to generation - earthquakes that perform human maladies in Kawah Iljan.
Singapore has a minima to save the economy
Singaporeans argue that they don't have children, on a career, stress and cost of living and education.
"The people of Singapore need growth."
I'm married and I'm the owner, you're my wife and you're the owner.
It may seem unbelievable that this composition is part of the commercials on mental bombs, but still - or maybe that is why - video at the beginning of this year in Singapore has spread mass on YouTube.
These flowers are part of a rap that uses local pests of the type "we give a book to the troupe" as high birth rates in Singapore.
The BBH advertising agency, which created the video, hopes that they will be warned of the problem in a funny way.
The head of the agency Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the influence of music in order for people to fulfill "their civil duty".
"It's a great deal about the Internet's involvement, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we had to feel it's the subject we have to touch.
We knew that the government had tried many things like expanding perfumes with pheromones or organizing registration feasts.
Many of these ideas may have been complex, but not completely functional.
So we've been thinking why don't do the most creative thing here, like making a rap to solve this problem."
1,2 children
The one who doesn't take it too much on a light weight is the Singapore government.
It spends $1,300 a year on encouraging citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and grants financial doses.
All these measures had a small effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with an outstanding technology in Southeast Asia, also known as the conservativeism of its representatives and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore is currently 1.2 children per woman in view of the breakdown of the population.
Finally, the birth rate of value 2 was exceeded, which was considered to be the restorative rate in 1976.
Why don't Singaporeans actually have more children?
Tan Wei Mingo, head of the Committee on Marriage and Family of the National Civil Service, says it is due to "better education" and "larger career opportunities".
"People thus have a broader scale of opportunity, when it comes to life goals and priorities, is not just marriage and family," he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and to the marriage and adoption of children. As a result, the decline in birth rates in Singapore is a result.
While there were drastic efforts within the framework of immigration policies to increase the number of immigrants as a measure against the decline in the number of citizens, this caused local people to be dissatisfied.
On some Singapore websites, it is seen as a hidden xenophobic against many new immigrants, especially Chinese people who are criticized for maintaining low wages and little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also considered as one of the reasons why Singapore's government has noted its worst choice since the beginning of independence.
After the elections, efforts were made to solve the problem through quotas and higher costs for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in fertility rates has a significant impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, health expenditure and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences in Singapore.
The government is trying not to set up such small houses.
For example, she began to influence business with property.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as "bots" which can be located in certain urban areas.
These apartments have a space of 46 square meters and have had great success in sales.
However, it is concerned that these apartments can support young life-styles and reflect developers to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of El Developers development companies, says their "bots" are being sold far faster than larger houses.
"They're more popular, and it's that they're sold for days and weeks faster than houses with more space.
That's why they're much better for our money flow."
However, it would be assumed that the new standards are more clear for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city.
Although these new rules could lead to an increase in the population's birth rate, the discussions with Singapore workers in the financial quarter in the city centre indicate that they will not have a major impact.
"People are still under stress, homes are expensive, just like education, so many people deny it," says a young official.
"Others have children.
But it's important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old, young man.
Men and women mention careers, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons for preventing children from getting pregnant.
So whatever the government tries to encourage citizens to have children, these are the same end of Singapores that have to do with the founding of the family last word.
What is private offline is private and online
Soukromi.
According to a dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is about something that has a personal attitude or about "the area of private life which has every right to protect against any violation".
What is private for a 16-year-old man?
How does this definition apply to everyday life and to social networks?
Does he understand the danger that is presented when he publishes on the Internet a matter that would certainly not tell anyone in normal communication?
Journalists from ElPeriodico spoke to five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept private for "something entirely owned" in the personal level and for "user name and password" if it was about a social network.
"I wouldn't reveal my greatest secret," says 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"It's very secret, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I give FB nice photos or pictures as we play.
I'll be there to talk to those I know.
I wouldn't share a picture that wouldn't be mine or a picture that would make someone laugh," she says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish local photographs, photographs of innocent people or photos of crimes, or to write down or make comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends who have F.B. and his nine supporters on Twitter.
Most of them are friendly.
There is also a mother who has a name and a password from one of the accounts.
"I put an account on Twitter so I could express my views and write interesting inputs.
I don't know if anyone answers me, I'm just giving them that," she adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or are quick to communicate with friends," she says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone suggested to him something unknown.
The case of fourteen-year-old Joseph is different.
This teenager's own accounts on the Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask websites and on the last mentioned network will allow him to identify 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something common, for example music," she says.
According to this boy, none of them knew anything about him, nor did he want his address or phone number.
"If they'd come to me or ask me to remove them from their account," she admits.
José signed up for Ask after reading his Twitter recommendations.
These boys are not strangers to experience what is today called cyberbullying.
"A well-known friend has been exposed to social networks.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who it was," he confirms.
According to Joseph, the victim didn't report it.
"You've only activated a private regime."
Then it explains a series of steps as to how the account is going safely.
Unlike George, this boy would publish photos of people known to be unhappy or sad.
"Of course I'd do it if someone guided me or just wanted me.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," she says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate of the Education and Education Division, has to understand that in order for children and adults to be properly oriented in social networks, they need to be informed that the main objective of these networks is to inform them.
It says: "The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but when social networking appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrios Porras notes that academic staffman Marc Prensky, a graduate of the University of Yale and the author of the article Digital Home and Digital Travelers, introduced these ideas to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital households are children and young people who were born during this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and yet we are first taught ourselves," she says.
He explains that it's a complex subject, "because we want them to know what's appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what's not, when they're not grown up."
Also to be - about the environment - reasonable, at a time when what is most difficult is to be loved, to have a thousand friends and not to think about the consequences," he adds.
According to this specialist, it is the most effective way for children and adults to show what is private, to ask questions that they need to think about.
"Tell them not to do anything, it doesn't work," she adds.
Dále Marrielos Porras mentions some of the options: Are there things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this online?
Or: Would you like someone to post your photo as you did your friend?
You know what others say about you?
When you mark the people on the photos of the celebration, did you ask those people to be excused?
And yet another: Do everyone need to know what you're doing?
The next point is to realize that they have to act in the Internet as well as outside it.
They're the same rules.
"A person is guided by respect, morality and other principles beyond the Internet and should be on social networks," he says.
Preview
Esturado Guardia, a university professor, first-class teacher and educator, explains that it is necessary for parents to read the rules of social networks carefully.
"If he understands each independence, he has a good basis for telling his or her children about the consequences that online account can have.
For example, as regards age or what is allowed to share or publish," she says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is key to remind children of the traditional rule of "negativity with strangers".
Summit South America's End and Lima's Declaration was not published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today will end without the publication of the Declaration from Lima, which was announced and which was signed by seven present presidents.
The Efe Agency has repeatedly tried to obtain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur Organisation, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and of the Presidential Office, who initially decided that the document was public after the end of the summit, indicated that it would be published later on the Peruvian government websites.
They further indicated that the content was published by Peruvian President Olanta Humalu in a few short press statements.
The journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video from the presidential meeting was transmitted without a voice with a message "confidential meeting, sound transmission".
The small amount of information available to journalists was provided by some government press speakers who were present, but never by Peruvian speakers.
The only document published during the meeting was a list of participants with the presidents, which resulted in hundreds of journalists from different national and international media who requested more information.
Later, the Peruvian Presidential Office sent an e-mail to the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was only about President Humal's statement, not about the official document that the summit closed.
Last spring, Peru hosted the third summit of the South American and Arab countries (America del Sur-Countrys Árabes, ASPA) and, at this time, not even the originally promised Declaration from Lima was published, although it was strongly required.
On the official ASPA pages it can be found that the document was published yesterday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities applied to ensure the transmission of information to all journalists, but were totally blocked.
In addition to other joint commitments made by Chile and Peru, the summit concluded the decision of the Hague Court of Justice which resolves the dispute on the border between the two countries.
The President of Peru Ollanta Humala and the President of Chile Sebastián Piñér met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in Haagu, which will begin on Monday by listening to both sides of the dispute against Santiago.
"We will take action and execute the judgment that will resolve the dispute we are having today in this international court," said President Humala together with his Chilean opposition.
"It was Chile, it will and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts," Piñar added, and congratulated President Humal with his strong hands on the train to both countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that the decision of the International Court of Justice was detailed was published after the adoption of the Bogotá Pact this week, which stated details of the international court’s decisions on maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered that decision to be totally wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the Presidents of Brazil (Dilma Roseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Christina Kirchnerová).
Paraguay was expelled from the Unasur organization in 2011 after the election of former President Fernando Luga and the meeting was not attended.
The host president of Olanta Humala was entrusted with opening early statements and closing the summit in Lima shortly after Monday.
The President read a final document informing the adoption of 16 agreements and planned to work on 31 projects between South American countries with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, the member countries of the UNASUR will take "the important steps towards achieving the objectives of South American citizenship for which residence agreements are extended".
He reported that actions have been supported to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organised crime, better access to medicines and cheap Internet in all continents of South America and joint and effective measures to combat the risks of natural disasters".
When Europe is in crisis, "there is no economic consolidation (Latin America) of a winning basis, although it must serve to expand our productivity and show our people a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects that improve transport connections between different parts of South America, in particular foreign and coastal areas, in order to better unite our countries and create new economic ties," said the Peruvian President in a read-only statement.
He mentioned that five of these projects were related to Peru and its fertile islands from the coast to Brazil, and the other two related to better relations with Ecuador, however, did not provide more details.
The final document also touched the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve as its return to the Union of South American nations," from which it is currently excluded.
Another concern he raised was the need for Latin America to remain prosperous and peaceful, which is a positive and good neighbourly relationship.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan opposition to Daniel Ortego in Mexico on Saturday, in order to carry out the judgment of the International Court of Justice on the maritime border dispute that was challenged by Bogotou.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortego tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We are offering all the solutions, no exceptions, no agreement with Nicaragua which would require a consultation with this country," he stressed.
"I hope I will be able to say to the President Ortega to lead the conversation as civilised and as detailed as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are to participate in the opening of the Dark President Enrique Peñi Niety.
In the context of the summit, the EU Defence Ministers agreed in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which reinforces dialogue and consensus on defence matters.
The members of UNASUR organisations are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last mentioned country is currently excluded.
Peru is a temporary president of this regional block.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common population is a goal in which "with South America, in this case indeed, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union (Unasur) in Lima, announced on state TV Peru that Europeans "killed after World War II" and in other conflicts "but now are practically one authority".
In this sense, a South American population project supported by Unasur's member countries was launched.
"It is necessary to target the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among members of the Andean Community, yet there are still retroactive areas that want us back to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also stated that he agreed with the restructuring of the Organization of American States (OAS) provided that the impact of the Anglo-Saxial States would be reduced and that those who signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights would be taken into custody.
"Those who are in the head are never bound to anything, and we the South American will all sign.
It is impossible to understand that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is funded by the United States in Washington," Ecuador's founder WikiLeaks Julian Assange put into charge of political asylum.
President Correa confirmed that this decision does not fall short because he did not violate his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at that time "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be issued to third countries regardless of the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticised Swedish justice, which asked him to give an opinion on the Swedish territory because of the particular sexual delinquency, while "the Swedish legislation itself allows for the lectures to be delivered by a video conference talk that could be delivered from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London".
Correa pointed out that there is a risk that Assango will be affected by physical and mental health.
"I haven't talked to him since what's on our wedding anniversary, but the wedding told me that he's got a little hairy problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of state.
"But it's dangerous that his physical and mental condition gets worse because he's locked up on a small space without the possibility of moving on clean air.
That would mean everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the settlement of Assange's asylum granted from June to the Ecuadoran Embassy in London on the basis of a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European Courts, and pointed out that he and London had had discussions with WikiLeaks in order to resolve the situation.
"We don't agree on human rights, we don't use such a word in this case, but discussions are still taking place.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European Courts, as Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón conducts a series of proceedings at various European courts," he said.
He said, "If the Great Britain comes out tomorrow, it's over."
And if Swedish Mr. Assango listens to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or through Skype, how it allows there to be no problem and how it has been implemented in other cases, tomorrow this problem will end."
Correa used this situation to present himself as a defence of freedom of print and explained that it is certainly not tolerateable "subordinateness, wrong ideas and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
We are not the biggest enemy of free press, we are losing and losing politics, although bad journalists in profit, oppression and exploitation services," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his pleasure that neither such journalists, "bankers, neither hegemonal countries nor bourgeoisies, do not rule Ecuador", and suggested that if it is re-elected, "it will continue to change the guided path and the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to continue maintaining the veto expressed by Paraguay with regard to membership in the Union of Unasur at least in its next elections and argued that the whole "must be strong and not tolerate opportunism and pukism committed to legality", because in fact "has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
In addition, Ecuador's president stated that he considered it "to be quite appropriate" to expect his Colombian opponent Juan Manuel Santos to join Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, at the time of the International Court of Justice in Haagu, which ruled in favour of Nicaragua.
At present, the judgment is not accepted.
"It's about the problem between South America and Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in order to get together.
There is a need to judge them widely so they can be overcome and have the opportunity to move forward."
He also expressed hope in the settlement of the maritime border dispute that was resolved by the same Court of Justice of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek an international court if both countries are committed to taking a decision whether to be firm".
With regard to the possibility that he would be candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to be held in order for his third term, he noted that he would consider this option "with great optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa announced that if she loses her vote in February 2013, she will leave public life.
"My personal interest was never very interesting, but such unfair situations as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be managed by political power.
My political commitment believed that I am the one who will guarantee this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I win, it would be my last presidential period and then I would leave politics.
When we lose, it's just waiting for me.
I've decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Huga Cháveze in Cuba.
"I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolas Madurem, who says that President Chavez went to planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
It's not about the recidivism in the president's state of health," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian state today participated in the sixth summit of the Heads of State and the Government of the South American Nations (Unasur), which was faced with challenges to greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was like a flash hit me," she said at the moments of the truth that the doctor tried to "rest up a bit," but apparently without success.
The boy's in front of his family.
He decided to take his disease on his own to his own bear and started to inform her about it, and with such a feeling that he had already celebrated the 43rd birthday.
It is certainly one of the most recent patients of the HIV Unit in Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battle with disabilities.
Fabrizio has been living with the virus of human immunodeficiency (HIV) for 22 years, which was something unprecedented at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, little treatment options and greater progress.
The director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) was not present with him at that time, "because he had a serious wound".
That's when I got AIDS was a synonymous death.
Now it's possible to survive and live fully with this syndrome.
However, there are many people who are unaware of their own weaknesses and who come when the virus has caused an organ cancer and has developed an immune system and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since the world's outbreak of AIDS, or at least from the first documented cases, "it has been a great success that the life span of a patient who starts in time and in an appropriate manner is exactly the same as that of healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, director of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, with this information confirmed in the year-long scientific publication.
Infectologist and specialist in HIV/AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not the cause of death, but that the duration of survival and full life depends on the degree of achievement of the immune system of patients who are diagnosed with disease, and better on those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 to 50 years.
It simply means that one who has been diagnosed with HIV in 25 years may, according to these terms, "be able to live without problems up to 75 years", explained in a doctor's discussion.
To highlight this progress, it is appropriate to note that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is 76 years today.
Despite a significant decrease in mortality in recent years and in the case of Mexico, from 6,678 in 2007, to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients have died since the outbreak of AIDS.
Only 255 people died in Jalisco State in 2011 and in April of this year, 187. However, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
- Why do people still die from the effects of the illness?
"I don't think there's any problem with access to treatment.
That's how I see it. That's what happens at our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not exhausted the resources of medicine. The problem is that patients are coming at a very advanced stage because they do not know the status of the ban or the late stage of weakness."
It adds convincing information: "Nine out of ten patients are coming when there is already some associated infection. The only thing we need to do is to have more impact on overall mortality, the disease is first diagnosed, and so on a large scale it is necessary to offer tests to detect the inability of all those who want them."
In its proposal, specialists and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco state and directly with patients like Fabrizio who have come to do tests in private labs only because he has done this to his friend, and despite his low age he has already contracted AIDS and the suffering of Kaposi sarcoma, a narcoma, which is one of the common complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was better, better for him, better for him, exercise, I'll take medication."
To date, his parents know only that he was suffering from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sexual life, but I pay attention to myself and to the other person," Fabrizio, who accepted the challenge to share his experience with Aunt Millenio JALISCO, to motivate those who are afraid today in the context of World AIDS Day.
"If they're at risk, so know what's first, if they're positive, it's better, and if they're already diagnosed, let's know they can live like anyone else if they're responsible."
This message includes the password for the fight against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms for powder
Among health programs and ordinary citizens there is a great loss, Ricardo Salazar, a guadalajar journalist, who discovers information about the HIV virus.
And the biggest mercres are in prevention.
In places that are dedicated to this task, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, given us one or two before, today give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which are very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the quickest of new orders are exciting.
"What do you want?" is a common question full of irony and consideration from social workers, school counselors, medical staff and health personnel who want to avoid, says the rapporteur.
He proposed to change this ineffective distribution. Whether condoms are only for pulses, but those hundreds are in dosings on public storage sites in places where they often go young.
"It's not support for promiscuity.
It's not even about paying them a beer and a motel, as Governor Emilio González responded to the question whether he would agree with the distribution of condoms in his period.
It's not that kind of sexuality. It's best to access the condoms of those who are already having sex," he noted.
Key numbers in Jalisco State
There were 13,435 cases (12 158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV).
This status is the fourth place in Mexico in new and discovered cases of AIDS and 13 places in connection with HIV.
92% of the order runs a sexual path, 6% of the blood path y 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50 thousand people can live with HIV virus, as in one registered case there are four to five people who do not know about disability.
The judgment approved by the Court of Appeal of the United States which does not recognise the restructuring of the company’s debt to the Group of Vitro established competition in Mexico calls for a slow precedent for any national business with neighbouring countries and the problem of solvency.
It appears, therefore, that the restructuring procedures for companies that allow Mexican laws, in the land of sands and stars are not paid in spite of international agreements.
The approval of the judgment issued on 15 June last year by Judge Harlin Halem of the Competition Court for Northern Texas leaves Mexico's companies in practice without defence against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other side of the river El Bravo.
However, the judgment is open to the main Mexican producer of glass to the Supreme Court of the United States with a call against three differences.
In the introduction it should be said that while the judge of this case claims that the creditors are to be governed by the U.S. insolvency law, the appeal court of the fifth period in New Orleans says that the main procedure is the competition procedure in Mexico.
Firstly, this would indicate the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of international enterprises.
For this purpose, a model law was established by the United Nations for the consolidation of international trade law, which is designated by the Arbitrary by the American Law Institute.
Second, the judgment states that without the vote of the parties from the internal business structure where the debt of the parent company of Vitro against the parties is recognised, the majority of the parties required for the restructuring is not reached.
However, this possibility of Mexico's law is permitted.
In fact, the case of Vitro was not the first to accept this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agrimex and Commercial Mexicana, for which the federal competition institution owes its internal debt.
In addition, it is true that even after counting the votes of the parties, the creditors - who stood before Vitro's company in court in the United States, i.e. the funds "husbands", such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - did not reach the majority.
The vote would reach about 45 per cent by 37.
That's what the court of appeal doesn't do.
From another point of view, it is the case for the company Vitro from a difficult situation that has been faced since 2008 - in the back of a serious economic crisis which has hit the United States.
In the meantime, the family company González Sady refers to the new assessment directly to the appeal court so that the assessment is carried out for full participation, thus for the participation of five judges, since only three of them were originally voting.
If it fails here, it will be required as an appropriate means of reviewing the process of higher courts, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
In this case, it is important that the court mentioned the document sent by the Mexican government as a company amicus curiae in which the procedure of Vitro under the Competition Act is detailed and shows that the company has facilitated its accession to the agreements signed by both countries to comply with the Act under Chapter 15 of the Act of Insolvency of the United States.
It also shows that the country has been governed by the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, which are rules for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for officials and creditors.
On both sides: punishment for the company Vitro and the state.
Overall assessment
Without notice, several months of criminal notice from the Mexican Air Force Committee against former owners of Gaston Azcarraga Andradem, who was named after the two-way operation, and according to the team's crew organisation, the compensation has already expired.
The Court of First Instance with Carlos Díaz Chavez Morineau has just appealed to the National Banking Commission and to the Commission for Value Papers, which is charged with obstacles to the achievement of justice.
According to it, the supervisory authority systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor of the Republic on the transaction carried out by this undertaking, where the company's name was 198 million pesos from the Bank of IXE from the F/589.
The funds were most likely directed at buying a share of the Professional Hotel Management (Administrator Professional de Hotels).
As we know, Ascárrag Andrade is a major shareholder of the network of Posadas hotels.
Dragon Martu relief
In the area of Universidad de Caribe, a group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens who approved the formation of the association met on the weekend with a view to preventing the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Kankun.
We are talking, as we know, about a large commercial and distribution centre with products from "a country with a large wall" aimed at Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential area for employees from 150 companies.
The Canacintra Organisation (Camara National de la Industria de Transformación) has previously been able to bring together the rulers of the south-east zones to set themselves against the monumental area, which would partly undermine protected areas and represent the source of all resistance to industry.
End of business with ACTA document
The application for a Senate which did not take a position and which required an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Prime Minister signed in Japan the Trade Agreement against Share, known under the brief ACTA, was rejected by the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiyadad Industrial).
As we know, despite the fact that the Senate itself has excluded the possibility of viewing it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in long-term horizon
In an attempt to pay long-term debt and not affect the short-term development company Homex on the market investment certificates for 500 million pesos.
This series is the first of four individuals who offer payment of fees every 28 days.
Born in Competival
The association of former companies in information technologies such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet created an association with the trade name Competival, which will aim to market software services in Central and South America.
Investment in business exceeds $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The basketball world leader Héctor "Hetin" Reyes had spent more than 60 years in this wild sport and was processing it all over the world.
Few people in Portugal have such a number of memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was before he was put to death in 2008 by a brain death on a racing cross burned into this sport over 60 years ago, whether as a player of younger categories, a national basketball league BSN player, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the national basketball league, or the president of the Puerto Rican basketball Federation.
"I have remained in my life in basketball a lot of role, including a few at the same time as when I was president of the National League of BSN in the 1990s, the head of the national team and president of the federation," Reyes recalled when he visited the reporters of Primera Hora at home in Bayamón, where he has been living with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes's claim of non-violence.
His house, which is almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia items from his long career, testifies.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest enthusiasm from all the camps, those who remember his performance in the Vaqueros from the 50th century where he was a player until 1982, when he celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or team owner at the same time.
"It was my best summer, the one I enjoyed most, because I had the opportunity to join the Vaqueros team since 1967 to participate in eight skills, whether as owner, partner, or trainer.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held in the years 1971 to 1975.
And then I broke up with one champion -- in 1981, when Jerome Mincy was debuting in BSN.
At that time he took the "Cuco" Ortiz, who was the most outstanding leader," said Reyes.
"I remember that Gene Bartow, who was a former coach here at the University of Alabama in Birmingham at the time, said to me: "I have a grown-up two-foot player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who ever had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended to me player Raymond Gaussey who became a team member and one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy brings Bayamon's victory in the championship, Gausse will contribute to another."
The champion, when Vaqueros played Gausse for the team, enjoyed it but only for a long time because in 1988 he had already played the role of the president of the basketball Federation.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his work and enjoy his place in the national team.
"I remember how we first defeated the United States in the qualifying Olympics in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the world's mystery in 1990, where we ended fourth, but we were supposed to have a bronze not to be the Canadian decision maker who let us repeat the final seizure," Reyes said.
Is it the best national team you've ever seen in 1990 from the world's mystery?
It's among the best, like the one who defeated Dream Team at Olympia in 2004.
But my favorite was the national team in the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and fired the U.S. man, which was quite similar to what brought us a bronze to the world's mysteries.
This man had not only Mincy, Gausseh, Ramona Rivase, Fica Lópeze and "Piculína" (Ortiz), but there were also young men (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers Leon (France and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 because of damage to the knee.
A man who may not have had a perfect composition but who was able to win the gold medal and bring great joy was a man from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in the Argentine Neuquén.
With players on tape like "Cantito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner who rewarded players excluded because of the race in the Pan American games in Mar de Plata, we won gold in spite of all the predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
It was no doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are effective.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved this level of results such as Piculin.
Not about his performance in different leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation that belonged to Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I really like the work of Leo Arilla from the young.
Which success do you consider to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous era of national men between 1988 and 1995 and that from the early 1990s, the National League of BSN had 17 men in one season.
What did you not prove?
There were things I wanted to take as a distribution of youth categories by regions.
For example, the Ponce guys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other islands only in national games-offs.
Now children travel a lot and play too much games, which isn't necessary.
I also see contributions in compulsory certificates and courses for trainers, decision-makers and decision-makers.
I'm glad.
What are you arguing about now?
I listen to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy learning, and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course I enjoy my wife Isabel, who was always next to me.
Dead here, Larry Hagman.
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth in Texas, played the world's leading role of John Rosse Ewinga, known as "J.R." in Dallas' television series, where he healed a man who was ill-treated and was charming and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role of the wooden red magnet J.R. Ewinga in the Dallas television series was a symbol of joy in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died according to the official notification of the family that the Associated Press agency provided Dallas Warner Bros., on Friday afternoon for cancer-related complications.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he again played the iconic role he had most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas on the Day of Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the time he died in the Italian hospital," announced her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, great, fun, nice, kind and talented, and he'll be very nice to me after him.
He was lonely and lived his life full," Linda Gray said in the announcement.
Hagman diagnosed liver surgery in 1992, and he admitted he drank a lot of alcohol for years.
In 1995, he found a secret nest on his liver and Hagman underwent transplants.
A year before the Dallas series was sent, Hagman celebrated on television as an obedient man in a remote comedy I Dream of Jeannie sent by NBC stations from 1965 to 1970.
This is where he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets the attractive girl (genna) who plays Barbara Eden and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedians who were sent only briefly, and to The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His action in the films included roles that were well-accepted by the criticism: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colours.
But it was until Hangman's mysterious performance was like an incredibly repugnant J.R. that led him to a star tower.
The dramatic series of CBS stations on the Ewing clan and other persons around them was sent from April 1978 to May 1991.
The propaganda slogan "Who shot Jajara?" which should have caused expectation about the part of the full emotion when Hangmanov is almost killed, has resulted not only in a huge number of speculations around the world, but also in the risk of millions of dollars in tax offices.
This also helped to achieve a consistent record of this work.
The November 1980 part, in which the answer was found, was followed by 41 million television fans. Dallas became the second most popular history series after the launch of the MASH series in 1983, followed by 50 million fans.
On J.R., he shot his brother Kristin (who played Mary Crobby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant and then threatened to make her a prostitute if she didn't leave town.
Hagman played Ewinga, an unsatisfied charismatic joke: a loyal businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, into the hospital.
"I know what I want to have J.R. on the tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be there: "Here lies the honest town of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, mentioned on Friday at Hagman as someone who was "beautiful even beyond him."
It is unforgettable and priceless for millions of admirers of the world, and in the hearts of all of us who were to know and love it.
Ten parts of the new Dallas series sent TNT stations a few months ago with great success.
"Five parts of the second row have already been completed and six have just been hit," the television station reported.
Immediately after Hangman's death there was no announcement from Warner or from TNT station on how to continue the series.
The Fort Worth family in Texas was the son of the heretic and singer Mary Martinov, who was born in classic parts, such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when in 1931 she was born to Larry, whose father was her husband, Lawyer Ben Hagman.
From the beginning of 50 C.E., Larry was lucky for the theatre scenes in New York and then served in England for the years 1952 to 1956.
There he met a young Swedish man named Mae Axelson who married him.
A couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived in the California city of Malibu for a long time.
In 2001 the autobiographical book Hello Darlin' was published: Tell (and Absolutely True) Suchs about My Life.
"I didn't leave anything there I knew it could hurt someone or harm him," said press Associate.
After liver transplantation, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped battle patients.
"I love them, I give them away, I'm dating them when they're going to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense "Don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy".
He was also active in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starts a course that examines "the end of the world"
Each week, students study apocalyptic subjects such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would take a course at the end of the world, he knew that it was an unremitting massacre: The end of May's "long number" calendar, which will come on December 21, was caught by many people as proof that the end of the world is coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what he was waiting for in several months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the calculated destruction that some call the " debt Armageddon", and the growing conflict that beset Israel, where, according to the Christian theory of the end of the world, the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most exciting semester he'd ever been," said Charmé to the students of Rutgers University in Camden in New Jersey this week.
When a person finds out what's going on in the world today, like if we had 30 days, it's a really good time.
And remember that bad signs of apocalyptic thinking good.
And it's not the only professor who offers courses about "the end of the world" in this season, which is theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, special assistant Barry Vacker organized the course "Miracles, culture and the end of the world".
Each week, students study apocalyptic subjects such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We understand why these ideas are spreading over time," she says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that lead to certain human behavior.
If, for example, nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, war can be eliminated.
This month, students are studying the apocalyptic movies and studying how they differ from real life examples.
"I have tried to inform the students what is possible, probable, credible and impossible," says Vacker.
In the main campus of the National University of Pennsylvania, professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amar Solari, a professional assistant in art and anthropology to organize a course with a simple name of the end of the world.
"We don't accept "2012," because we always count on the opportunity to reorganize the course if the world doesn't end," Restall said.
The students must also study, create projects and do final tests, despite the "threatening ban".
At Penn State will be a final test to finish on the night of the Apocalypse, which does not give students the opportunity to work "until the evening of the world's expected end," Restall said.
The cows have become quite popular.
"He's been away for two hours," Restall said about his course for students with a high average of 35 enrolled.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the season, we received an e-mail asking if it was still a place.
The students themselves ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people are doing to please themselves," said the 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson of the University of Rutgers in Camden, a student in the field of religion and sociology from Haddonfield in New Jersey.
And then the apocalyptic, secular or religious thought is just a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Weekes, a 25-year-old psychologist and nursery student, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour in which it could be learned," he said.
"I'm using it."
But no educated student, because the professor said he didn't believe in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project agreed on May and we will definitely get rid of it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at the University of Temple in West Chester.
"Mayows never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that there is a apocalyptic decline in Western culture that has lasted for several centuries, which people have responded to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The discovery of these speculations has influenced the Internet.
"Jinde doesn't think about it," he said.
That's what's happening in most English speaking worlds.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is presenting this year to the Philippines, asked if he knew about any course on "the end of the world", he answered quickly.
"Philippines are no part of the world," he wrote and pointed out an exception to the highest authority.
We've got Pappeja's mercy.
Restall noted that during the past year he talked about many days of the last trial and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will start to think immediately about the next date" or philosophy that 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period at which the world will end.
The date will be taken by students and teachers.
Several said they were meant to go to "the end of the world".
"I'm calling a few friends to laugh together," explained the 20-year-old student of Samira Ford's communication.
