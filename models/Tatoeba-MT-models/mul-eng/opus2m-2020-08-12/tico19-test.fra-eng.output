Rapid increase in the incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary disease cases (COVID-19) shows a similar evolution in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that although it is at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly across all countries.
According to the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care services should be prepared for a small number of CVID-19 patients in need of care, and in particular intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, an unknown etiology pneumonium case was reported in Wuhan, the province of Hubei, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus known as Coronavirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from the infection in SARS-CoV-2 has been baptized with coronavirus (COVID-19).
Today, approximately 80 per cent of COVID-19 people are suffering from a bout of affection, i.e. a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, most of which heal.
In some 14 per cent of cases, COVID-19 has a more severe impact on hospitalization, while 6 per cent of the remaining cases develop a serious form of disease that requires intensive care.
The mortality of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we assess the evolution of the COVID-19 cumulative impact in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEC) and the United Kingdom (R.-U.S.), and compare it with the developments that have taken place in the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Case COVID-19 in EU/EEA and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamic of COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world is currently following that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In the edition of 5 March 2020, Spiteri and al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe following the WTO definition of cases.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China.
On 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (R.-U.S.) with, between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39 768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy alone.
Acquisition of the cumulative number and the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECPCM), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country across the world, obtained only from official sources such as health departments, national and regional health authorities of the different countries as well as WHO, is updated daily at 08 00.00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom and to establish a comparison with Italy's experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we have calculated the impact of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, within each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the total number of cases reported in each country from 15 March 2020 to 8 p.m. with Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Development of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The evolution of the 14-day incident of COVID-19 cases within EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom has generally followed that of the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the combined impact of COVID-19 began to grow around 21 February before a dramatic increase in around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This has been mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have submitted a similar increase in COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 presents the sum of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom in relation to Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is noted that by 15 March at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases similar to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of cases reported by COVID-19 is increasing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the COVID-19 cumulative incidence suggests that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in responses to national public health services, potential variations in case definitions, and differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for CVID-19 confirmation, including for ratification tests.
In early March 2020, doctors from affected regions in Italy indicated that about 10 per cent of CVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of cases of COVID-19 in hospitals and/or in intensive care are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (unpresented data).
However, a systematic collection is needed to complete the current monitoring data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed an important difference in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care for 100,000 people in 2010-11).
Modelling scenarios relating to the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalised cases associated with a risk > 90 per cent of excess capacity in intensive care are provided in the sixth update of the rapid assessment of CEPCM risks related to COVID-19.
Given that cases have so far been grouped in some regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and that hospitals and intensive care services are generally hosted by a defined regional population, data on cases and beds should, above all, be established at level 2 of the Statistics Nomenclature (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a community-supported SARS-CoV-2 transmission scenario and for an increase in the number of CVID-19 patients in need of care, in particular intensive care, as well as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by the recent rapid assessment of the risks of CEPCM, a rapid, proactive and expeditious approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2 through an approach to an approach to mitigation, as soon as the rapid and early increase in the number of cases could not leave sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if nothing had been implemented.
The rapid assessment of risks also reflects public health measures that help to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window during which each country can strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Nevertheless, it is likely that the health systems of other EU/EEA countries will have to deal with a few patients who need intensive care in the days or weeks to come.
The COVID-19 epidemic, caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 infections in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a humanitarian disaster.
As its counterpart, the SARS-CoV, which resulted in thousands of cases of SRAS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by raw keys and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 presents a greater severity and mortality than SRAS, but it is much more transmissible, and it affects older people than young people and men more than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide an appropriate and thorough review of this subject of full research.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognostication and disease prevention.
Although many questions still await answers, we hope that this review will contribute to better understanding and eradication of this serious disease.
The spring festival, on 25 January 2020, has never been observed by the Chinese, who have been forced to stay closed for all the days of the Golden Week and for many other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the Coronavirus (CoV) which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) in 2003; that is why SARS-CoV-2 was baptized by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease known as Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout China before it expanded to nearly 50 other countries throughout the world.
On 2 March 2020, the virus had caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being hospitalized and more than 3,000 dead.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "the enemy public number 1", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nei.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 work has been published on COVID-19, including in the areas of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 on the sequence of the virus, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesis research progress on this new topic in full.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SRAS and another coronavirus disease, the respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (MERS, an epidemic in 2012).
We will also focus on what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and predictation, and we will address some issues still outstanding but urgent.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered to be non-mortem pathogens for Man, mainly causing about 15% of common rhumes 4.
However, during this century we have known two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for Man, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third Coronavirus epidemic in recent history.
As presented in Fig. Fig.1.1, pneumonia shelters then unknown were first reported to Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported in Wuhan.
In the meantime, the epidemic was spread rapidly in cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with an interruption of its entire public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on disease indicated that only 21 patients in 41 confirmed cases had been in direct contact with the Wuhan marine fruit market, considered to be the starting point for infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO qualified for the global health emergency epidemic.
At the time of this report, disease had already spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).
As the situation changes rapidly, the final scale and severity of the epidemic remain to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study conducted in 8,866 patients, including 4,021 COVID-19 confirmed cases, presented an updated view of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bbbbdA).
The SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65 years.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few in 20 years, and only 14 were less than 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
The COVID-19 developed in homes, mainly in the province of Hubei and in Periphery.
The mean duration between symptoms and COVID-19 diagnosis was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean duration between symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The baseline production rate (R0) was 3.77 (IC to 95%: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected has increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, which coincides with the massive movements that took place before the spring festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44 per cent (IC 95 per cent: 1.10-1.86 per cent), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06 per cent (IC 95 per cent: 2.02-4.59 per cent).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (human), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronavirus is a subfamily of large infected viruses containing a simple BRN.
They can be classified in four species, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronavirus known to infect the Man belonging to the alpha and beta species.
Spike (S) of the container relates to angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then a membrane merger occurs.
The viral ARN gene is released in cytoplasm; after replication of the viral gene, the genetic ARN accompanied by glucoproteins of cover and nucleocapside proteins forms of viruses containing viruses, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first economic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a new type of beta-coronavirus, with over 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples taken on the site of origin of the epidemic, the Huanan Sea Fruit Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With the help of electronic microscopy in transmission, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been detected in ultrafine sections of human epithelium of respiratory pathways.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a recipient of SARS-COV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 protein S is linked to ACE2 less strongly than SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less significant infection than SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by the Orf3b and a secret protein coded by the Orf8.
The ORS-CoV-2 Orf3b could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNb; however, the Orf8 does not contain known areas or functional reasons.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, and al., presented the complete human ECE2 cryo-ME structure with a resolution of 2.9 Å complex with the B0AT1 amino acid carrier.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformity, was assembled in the form of a dime and that the complex ACE2-B0AT1 could bind two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening in order to eliminate infection in SARS-CoV-2.
The original host and the intermediate host
It has been established that SARS-COV and MERS-COV have derived raw keys and that they have been transmitted to the Man through the pipes and cameliads, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, the souri keys have been advanced as being the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SRAS types of sour strains called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZXX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to break the barrier of species to infected Man remains unknown, and the route of transmission is still to emerge.
I, and al., have issued the hypothesis that the virus could have been transmitted to Man by snakes, which would involve a homologous combination of S protein.
According to a study conducted by researchers in Guangzhou, China, the Pangolin - a mammifer in the long museum feeding cheeses, often used in Chinese traditional medicine - could be the average host of SARS-CoV-2 if it is judged by genetic homology 99% between a coronavirus discovered in the pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1 % difference between two genes is a difference of importance; it is therefore appropriate to expect final results to establish concrete evidence (Figure.33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
The SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50 %.
The SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties very well.
It would seem that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ethanol at 75%, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloride and other fat solvents, but not chlorohexidine, can effectively disable the virus.
The entire population is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed study has been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to studies previously conducted on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).
In general, when a virus is infected with a host, it is first recognized by its immune system by means of molecular molluscs (PRR) receptors, including type C ectin receptors, type Toll receptors (TLR), type NOD receptors (NLR) and type RIG-I receptors (RLR).
In various ways, the virus induces the expression of inflammation factors, dendritic cell maturity and type I interferon synthesis (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophasis of viral ancestors.
However, SARS-CoV protein N may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response combines the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including T CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in the defense.
T CD4+ cells stimulate B cells that produce specific virus antibodies, and T CD8+ cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Aid T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defense cells.
However, coronavirus may inhibit T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humor immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system results in a local explosion of free radicals, which can lead to serious damage to lungs and other organs and, in the worst scenario, a multi-visceral failure, death.
The infection in SARS-CoV-2, characterized by a home appearance, is more likely to affect elderly people with congenital disabilities and pregnant women.
It is widely accepted that persons exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be from 1 to 14 days, but generally more than 3 to 7 days after a study of 425 first cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the duration of incubation was 3 days on average, for a forkset ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, has concluded a 4.8-day incubation period (3.0-7.2) according to a demographic of 8 866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the effective duration of the quarantine after a maximum period of incubation, in order to avoid the transmission of the virus by individuals infected with a symptomatic nature.
Generally, people exposed to or infected by the virus are placed in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and can be accompanied or not by other symptoms such as dryness, swelling, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, headache, diarrhoea, thoracic pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had a dyspnoea and/or hypoxaemia one week after the disease appeared.
With regard to serious cases, patients rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients presenting fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those presenting acute fever, even in the absence of thoracic radiographic anomalies, should be tested for the virus in order to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients were 98 per cent of fever, 76 per cent dry, 55 per cent dyspnoea and 3 per cent diarrhoea; 8 per cent of patients needed ventilator assistance.
Similar findings have been reported by two recent studies on a family and on a home site following the transmission of the virus from a symptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dryness (47%) and dyspnoea (55%).
However, 80 per cent needed ventilator assistance, rather than CVID-19 patients, which is consistent with a higher MERS profitability compared to CVID-19.
A diarrhoea (26%) and a throat disease (21%) have also been observed in patients with MERS.
With respect to SRAS, the main symptoms were fever (99% to 100%), dryness (29% to 75%), dyspnoea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%) and throat disease (13% to 25%), and ventilation assistance was required for approximately 14 to 20% of patients.
On 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2 per cent, for 66,576 cases worldwide.
Comparably, the mortality of SRAS in November 2002 was 10 per cent for 8 096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37 per cent for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 reached 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) at 95% of 5.71-7.23 while SARS-CoV R0 ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a more important capacity to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but that it is less lethal.
Consequently, it is much more difficult to control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics than it has been for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or in a collection or vehicle, as in the case of a cruiser.
Patients have often traveled or resided in Wuhan or in other regions affected, or have been contacted by people infected or patients in the past two weeks before symptoms appear.
However, it has been shown that individuals can be carriers of the virus without the presence of symptoms for more than two weeks and that rehabilitated patients can be new carriers of the virus, which highlights the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the first stages.
For example, a lymphopenia with a number of white blood cells < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, as well as a high rate of aminotransferase aspartate and a virus was identified in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had high levels of hepatic enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte seduction.
In the most serious cases, the D-Dimere rate, a fibrine degradation product present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Thracic radiographic anomalies are found in most patients with CVID-19, characterized by bilateral inegal clouds or an opioid-like depletion of lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas exchanges.
The dysfunction of Type I and Type II pneumocytes results in a decrease in surface rate and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the ability of lungs to contract and increase the risk of pulmonary collapsus.
Consequently, the most worrying thoracic examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, COVID-19's first pathological analysis revealed a decomposition of pneumocytes, the formation of hyalinic membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of multi-nucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which coincides with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA and appears to those of SRAS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 ARN through a chain reaction by polymerase after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for CVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to the high level of negative, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations have begun to be used for diagnosis (which was then not solely based on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SRAS.
Thus, the combination of medical ancestors, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the group Feng Zhang described a SHERLOCK technology-based technology protocol based on CRISPR technology for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which allows the identification of SARS-CoV-2 synthetic fragments between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using an active bundle of less than one hour, without the need for sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practice, if its use on clinical specimens would have ended.
Because of lack of experience with the new Coronavirus, doctors can only provide support to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of treatments that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, retable patients’ plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of retable patients has been proposed for treatment purposes.
Pharmacotherapeutic companies are all used to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
The SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks lungs in the first time and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing the ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidney.
Nevertheless, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to alleviate the symptoms and to save lives; it includes general oxygen therapy, high-density oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), an altered cardiac dehydration technique used to treat heart failure or critical respiratory failure.
Furthermore, maintenance of electrolytic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as the protection of the functions of live organs are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
An excessive reaction of the immune system has been observed to cause cytokinetic shock in patients with SRAS and MERS.
A cytokinetic shock is a systemic inflammation response form characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNá, IFNb, IFNg and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and a multivascular failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinetic shocks, especially for serious cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used to treat cytokinetic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinetic shocks include modulation of immune response by T cells, blockage of IFN-g, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, inhibition of JAKs, blinatumomab, cytokines 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in treating SRAS in order to reduce the severity of inflammation.
However, the use of high-dose steroids had no beneficial effects on severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SRAS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would have serious side effects, including vascular osteonecrosis, which would significantly affect the forecast.
However, careful use of short-dose low-dose corticosteroids has been recommended for patients with severe CVID-19.
No effective antiviral therapy has yet to be confirmed at the time of this report.
However, the intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, has been shown to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed from Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
As a result, reddesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other non-BN viruses, including MERS and SRAS.
In view of these findings, Gilead has transmitted the composition to China to allow for a number of tests on individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2, and the results are very expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir association and ribavirin have been developed as potential treatment for patients suffering from acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, Hepatitis and other side effects may occur following combination treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma for retable patients and antibody production
Collecting blood with patients who are cured of an infectious disease in order to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect individuals with this disease is an anti-strategic practice.
In fact, retable patients often present a relatively high rate of antibodies against pathogen.
Antibodys are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by the B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
The plasma was thus extracted from the blood of a group of patients with COVID-19 who were cured and injected to 10 severely affected patients.
Their symptoms were improved at 24 hours, associated with a decrease in the inflammation phenomenon, a reduction in viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary in order to be able to propose this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some adverse events associated with plasma should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can lead to excessive stimulation of immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, potentially fatal.
Concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and plasma demand for treatment in patients with severe illness is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a global epidemic.
Consequently, it is more essential and more effective to isolate the B cells from retable patients and identify genetic codes for the relevant antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would speed up the production of antibodies.
The MTC has been used by millions in China to treat a wide range of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to diagnosis, based on MTC theories.
Most of the effective components remain little or no known as it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their best associations.
At the present time, due to the lack of specific effective CVID-19 treatment, MTC is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or a severe form of disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen cells have been shown to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The best cure rates for COVID-19 have been observed in the provinces of China where 87 per cent of their patients have been applied to MTC, including Gansu province (63.7%), Ningxia region (50%) and Hunnan (50%), while the province of Hubei, which has only benefited from 30 per cent of COVID-19 patients, presents the lowest treatment rate (13 per cent).
However, this is rather approximate because many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account for the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and its collaborators published a study that compared treatment with Western Medicine (MO) alone and combined treatment associated with MO and MTC.
It appears that the time of return to normal body temperature, the time of disappearance of symptoms and the duration of hospitalization were much shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only.
Even more impressive, the severity of symptoms (severe mild) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (7.4% against 46.2%) and mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% against 39%).
However, the effectiveness and innocence of the MTC remains to be specified through a more controlled test conducted and in more and more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of MTC treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as likely or confirmed cases of COVID-19 are generally concerned about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those in quarantine also experience feelings of jealousy, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SRAS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic crises, psychomotive excitement, psychotic symptoms, acute confusional state and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact research and quarantine, as part of the response of public health services to the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt of the disease against the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatization of their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided in patients with CVID-19, in individuals identified as likely cases, in persons in contact with these populations, and in any other person in distress.
This psychological support must include the training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and precise updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid any close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to halt the transmission chain of animal reserves and human beings infected with vulnerabilities and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein S-based vaccines to produce powerful long-term neutralising antibodies and/or to induce protection against SARS-CoV.
Life-threatening vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for SRAS.
However, the in vivo effectiveness of these potential vaccines in elderly people and on models subject to lethal provocation and their protection from a zoonotic virus remains to be determined, as no clinical study has yet been started.
This is probably due to the fact that the SRAS was extended 17 years ago and that no new case has been reported since.
On the other hand, MERS' sporadic cases and settlements continue to be reported in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS with the help of an inactive virus, DNA plasmas, viral vectors, nanoparticulars, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunised individuals is an urgent and essential objective to control the current epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the important time (18 months on average) needed to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations in coronavirus.
As a result of an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical development through thousands of patients.
In most cases, the disease is progressively rehabilitated without centuries.
However, in view of SRAS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most serious cases.
Therefore, setting up a forecast model is essential for health agencies to be able to give priority to their services, particularly in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies conducted so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the forecasting of COVID-19 patients are the following (Table 33):
Age: age was the main factor for the predictation of SRAS, and this also seems to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30 to 65 years, with 47.7% over 50 years, according to a study conducted on 8 8 866 cases, as described above.
Patients with a need for intensive care were more likely to present underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (mean 66 years and 51 years), suggesting age as a predictive factor for COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who need intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart attacks and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in SRAS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has been established that it can also be associated with positive ACE2 chlorangocytes, which can lead to hepatic dysfunction in patients with CVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and can interact with each other.
abnormal laboratory results: the C-reactive protein rate (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue lesions; it has been advanced as a potential predictor of disease, response to treatment and healing.
The correlation between the CRP rate and severity as well as the COVID-19 forecast was also proposed.
In addition, a high rate of dehydrogenised lactate (LDH), aminotransferase aspartate (AST), aminotransferase alanine (ALT) and kinase creatinine (CK) may also contribute to the development of the forecast.
These enzymes are widely expressed within several organs, including at the heart and liver level, and are released in case of tissue lesions.
They are therefore traditionally the markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: the results of thoracic radiography and the temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in conjunction with other elements for determining the predictive and complications of CVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are common immunosuppressors used to treat infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammation.
Since high doses of corticosteroids have been widely used for severe cases of SRAS, many survivors have presented vascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and quality of life.
Thus, when necessary, administration of steroids to CVID-19 patients should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental stress: as described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has caused a large number of exceptional cases of stress, patients often known for long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty as well as the death of close relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and find a normal life.
According to the demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of SRAS.
In addition to reacting to lower respiratory conditions, SARS-CoV-2 also effectively responds to higher respiratory conditions and does not develop or cause symptoms in the first phase of the infection, depending on the origin of coronaviruses.
Consequently, newly infected or incubated individuals can produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly impedes the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by patients seriously ill, with very low transmission probability in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 epidemic is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than it was in SRAS.
Significant efforts are currently being made in China, including the holding of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continuing deployment of quarantine of almost all the population in order to halt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases has declined, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the growth phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, and al., believe that COVID-19, which seems to be much more infectious than SRAS, will not extend in 2020.
Ira Longini, and al., have developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two thirds of the world's population.
A group of Canadians reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the removals of the middle nasal cord and the throat of retable patients, 2 weeks after their hospital exit, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode at the start of the flu.
However, encouraging signs were observed in China with the progressive reduction of new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to the initial estimates, Ebola virus should lead to up to one million cases and one half million deaths.
However, due to quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was finally controlled.
It is possible, as for SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 decreases in terms of infection to eventually expand or develops into a less pathogenic virus co-existing with Man.
A comparison of COVID-19 epidemic with SRAS and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig.55).
The SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by waves or seasons, as well as by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in cells, thus opening up a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients revealed that 41 per cent of cases were likely from non-economic infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
Thus, precautions should be taken to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, close relatives and fellow patients, and even anyone who may be in contact with patients or persons who are infected.
The first possible line of defense to reduce the risk of infection lies in the port of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and breathing masks N95 (1860) is involved in controlling the spread of viruses.
The surgical masks prevent the projection or depositing of potentially infected gums on surfaces where they could be transmitted to other persons.
However, only the N95 (1860) masks provide protection against inhalation of viruses from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of viruses capable of perpetrating completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV size, as both measures are about 85 nm.
Since individuals are able to pass five surgical masks applied to each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients carry N95 masks (1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals must carry adjustable isolation bubbles to further reduce contact with viruses.
The viruses may also infect an individual by means of eye contact.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor discovered that he was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while carrying a N95 mask; the virus could have damaged his organism by means of inflammation.
As a result, health professionals should also carry transparent visas or patient protection lenses.
For the populations of affected or potentially affected regions, it is strongly recommended to wash your hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, stay confined to maximum and limit contact with potentially infected persons.
It is recommended to maintain a distance of one meter with patients.
These measures are effective means of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for Man, its high level of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, has had to have placed China as a high alert after the SRAS epidemic in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Disease Control and Prevention Centre assured the population that the new virus was non-communicable, that it had limited interhuman transmissibility and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message has led to a remarkable release, especially at the time when the whole country was preparing for the spring festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan has been lost.
The Chinese disease control agencies must learn lessons and take the necessary measures.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more careful in their public announcements, as each word has and may affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) demonstrate greater sensitivity and responsiveness to the inadvertent clinical data than to wait for formal medical reports or official bodies; (3) demonstrate more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic at its beginnings than to try to reassure the population; and (4) perform more targeted and relevant exercises in order to raise awareness of the population about epidemics, but also to regularly test and improve the social response system.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of the drafting of this report, it has spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to SRAS, the COVID-19 epidemic is born as an impression already seen.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SRAS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than young people and men more than women; pregnancy and mortality are also more important among older people.
SRAS presents a mortality higher than COVID-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44 per cent).
The transmission of COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SRAS was mostly transmitted by patients seriously ill; it is therefore much more difficult to contain COVID-19 propaganda.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and much wider than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 ARN detection tests may be negative for some COVID-19 patients.
Retable patients, on the other hand, may be re-positive to the virus.
This significantly increases the risk of proliferation.
Despite the rapid progress of research on COVID-19, several critical issues remain outstanding, including:
Where's the SARS-CoV-2?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two types of SRAS coronavirus from raw keys, it is not enough to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 comes from chiropters.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the original host virus, such as the souri keys, to Man?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively stop transmission, and the epidemic can be resumed at any time.
A molecular modelling and biochemical analysis have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, but how does the virus directly penetrate into respiratory cells and how does it cause pathological changes?
Is the virus also related to the cells expressing the ACE2 from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve on the genetic level during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve into global pandemics, disappear like SRAS or re-surface regularly like flu?
It is essential, even if this may take time, to get answers to all these questions as well as to many others.
However, regardless of the expenditure that this must entail, we have no choice but to end this epidemic as soon as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
In general, the duration of incubation of these two viruses is less than one week followed by approximately 2 weeks of disease.
Only few immunodepressed patients have had severe respiratory infections below.
The first case of SRAS goes back to the province of GuangDong in China by the end of 2002.
Without counting the super transmitters, it was estimated that each case could be approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of between 4 and 7 days, the viral load peak on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headaches, fever, dyspnoea and fever, follow-up of dyspnoea, cough and respiratory distress such as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, false liver function tests and high kinase creatinine are current anomalies observed in laboratory analyses if SRAS is suspected.
Widespread alveolar lesions, spread of epithelial cells and increased macrophages are also observed in patients with SRAS.
Some 20 to 30 per cent of patients then need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory conditions, several organs including gastrointestinal pathways, liver and kidney may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokinetic shock, which may be fatal in particular in immunodepressed patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCV.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands by the end of 2004.
At first, it was prevalent among young children, elderly people and immunodepressed patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is current in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal removal of a 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present in the world.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with an obstructive length, also called group.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
For HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present worldwide, resulting in moderate respiratory diseases.
In general, when these HCOVs acquire the ability to effectively transmit and maintain themselves continuously to humans, they also become less virulent or pathogens.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The MERS clinical manifestations are similar to those of SRAS and are characterized by an evolutionary water phenomenon.
Unlike SRAS, many patients suffering from MERS have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS in relation to HCOV pathology.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
On 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 cases confirmed in laboratories were reported with a high death rate of 34.4 per cent, which is one of the most deadly viruses known to man by the MERS-CoV.
A diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoV revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the period of incubation and the duration of HCOV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-COV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-COV and the four Community HCOV (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like the other HCOV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in seed samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and its sustainable distribution after human transmission, will have an impact on the ultimate target of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four Community HCOVs that cause moderate symptoms are well adapted to man.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCV pandemics.
In order for this to occur, HCVs must re-replicate in humans in a sufficient proportion to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for the constraints of the host.
In this perspective, the increased incidence of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics continues and the more number of people infected are important, the more chances of the virus becoming fully human.
If appropriate, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by one quarter or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four COVs acquired in the community are circulating within the population, resulting in a simple rhummy in the subject of immunocompetence.
These viruses do not need to store animals.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, highly pathogens, have not adapted well to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic reserves and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably through one or more intermediate and amplifier hotels.
The SARS-CoV-2 presents characteristics similar to those of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and of the four HCOVs acquired in the Community.
However, it is more pathogens than HCOVs acquire in community and less pathogens than SARS-Cov or MERS-COV.
It remains to see if it will be fully adapted to human beings and will circulate among these latter without a reservation or intermediate host.
Before discussing HCV animal origins, it will be helpful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reserves, intermediate and amplifiers of HCV.
An evolutionary host animal of a HCOV opens a nearby riser sharing a high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The original virus is often well adapted and is not pathogen for its host.
In the same way, a reservation host opens the HCOV continuously and in the long term.
On the other hand, HCOVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish a long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate hotel becomes a natural reservation hotel.
In particular, given that 80 per cent of Guangzhou market animals present anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several small mammals can also serve as amplifier intermediates cannot be excluded.
These raw keys are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genetic sequence.
These studies have laid the basis for a new concept that causes noise keys are emergency human pathogens.
The human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that HIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that the raw keys are not the immediate reservation host of SARS-CoV.
That's why the souri keys can't be the host of the MERS-CoV intermediate reservation.
In addition to studies conducted in the Middle East, drummers have shown that they were seropositive to specific antibodies neutralizing the MERS-CoV, as well as the original camels from the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camouflages extract the virus not only by respiratory pathways but also by fecal route, which is also the main route of excretion of the souri keys.
We cannot exclude the possibility that Pangolin is one of SARS-CoV-2's intermediate animal hosts.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 is even less important than that which separates beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from Pangolin.
Recombination is a major factor in the evolution of beta-CoV.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCV, zoonotic origins of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCOV-NL63 and HCV-229E could both be derived from the CV of raw materials, while HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 parent viruses were found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E has been genetically associated with another CV of Souri Key CoV called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while Camelids have also been suspected of being intermediate hotels.
When HCOV-OC43 opened the species barrier to humans from domestic betel to about 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of the inter-kind transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV of the close HCoV-229E mouse key have been found.
First of all, unlike alpagas, men can have contact with raw keys in a shared ecological nest.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpagas.
Then, alpha-Cov of the souri key belonging to HCoV-229E are numerous and not pathogenic in the souri key, while alpha-Cov of the alpaga has caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-COV of the alpaga was not found in wild animals.
In fact, rats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that the Mouse Keys can transmit HCOV-229E directly to man.
Another possibility, while the alpha-CoV key key uses HCoV-229E genetic reserve, alpagas and drummers could serve as intermediate hospitals by transmitting viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-COV is an excellent example of the inter-kind transmission of raw keys to drummers and human drummers.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-COV found in raw keys is known by its initial identification and has also been enhanced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been present in the miners for decades.
It has been well adapted to these camouflages that have been passed from medium to stable natural reservation.
Unlike the role of camels in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of Pangolins in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission, if they have one, is different.
In particular, the pangoline beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in the pangoline.
Several inter-kind transmission possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 have been included or excluded from future studies.
Firstly, the souri keys could be the host to book a virus belonging to SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological nest with the souri keys through the depletion or carbon mines.
Secondly, Pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifiers that a virus related to SRAS-CoV-2 has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus by digestion and consumption of liver meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the combination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have taken place within a third species that were both in contact with the souri keys and the pangolins.
Research on SARS-CoV-2 animal origins is underway.
Compared to other simple-bore ARN viruses, the estimated exchange rates of CVs could be considered as "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the CV adjustment phase to new hotels.
However, the exchange rates of CVs are about one million times higher than those of their hotels.
In addition, the rate of change is often high when the CVs are not well adapted to the host.
In relation to SARS-CoV, with a high rate of change, the change rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be lower, suggesting a higher rate of human adaptation.
It can be assumed that it has already been adapted to another close human hotel.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well suited to the drummers.
In theory, genetic derivatives are unlikely to produce vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 in short-term ineffective.
Thirdly, CVs change randomly and frequently in the replication of the NRA through a single "copying" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found both for HCOV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43, as well as for CoV observed in animals, such as SL-COV and BatCoV-HKU9.
HIV-Host interaction related to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with a host receiver is another key factor affecting inter-kind transmission.
The SARS-CoV recombination is used as a typical example here; it also shows positive selection evidence during inter-kind transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be key factors in the human-to-human-virus adaptation.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receiver as SARS-CoV.
A 30 % difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S unit means that the affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic chryochroscopy study indicates a 10 to 20 times higher affinity of this link than that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, HCOV-NL63 is also related to the ACE2 but with a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCOV receptors, such as HCV-229E aminoeptidase N for HCov-229E, and 9-O-acetyl silic acid for HCV-OC43.
The difference between human protein and HCOV's natural reserves, such as raw materials, ruminants and rodents, could be a barrier to inter-species transmission.
New HCov Emergency: Return to the Home Home
The variety of key-sourish CVs offers many emergency opportunities for new HCVs.
In this sense, the CVs are genetic reserves of HCV.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, given that SARS-CoV key viruses were isolated, but different ORF8 proteins were coded.
This removal separates the ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b and is present as an adaptive change that promotes the change in the host.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14.
It has also been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has been known to recombinage episodes between different lines, which have occurred in Saudi Arabia's drummers.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the souri key and camera viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga presents a simple nucleotide insert, which will trigger a decalation of the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCOVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted on their reservation hotels.
Cases of symptoms or moderate symptoms were detected when the souri keys were infected by CVs, indicating a mutual adaptation between the CVs and the souri keys.
It seemed that the souri keys were well adapted to the CV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, anomalies in the activation of the pro-inflamatory response in the souri keys effectively reduce the pathology caused by the CVs.
In addition, the high level of reactive derivatives of oxygen (DRO) generated by high metabolic activity of the souri keys could at the same time eliminate the replication of the CV and affect the "relecture" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and lead to highly pathogenic viral shocks when introduced into a new hotel.
More pathogens could also develop by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
So it's not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
The CVs are non pathogens or cause moderate symptoms in their hotels to be reserved such as raw keys and camouflages.
They respond strongly without causing a strong immune response from the hotel.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptotic carriers and what causes serious cases of infection in the human family are present.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of immune response and cytokinic shock; the more immune response is strong, the more pulmonary lesions are severe.
On the other hand, among the asymptotic carriers, the immune response was derived from the replication of the CV.
The same immune response dissociation strategy could have beneficial effects on treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of infection to SARS-CoV-2 should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammation is impaired in the souri keys.
Following this reasoning, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of CVID-19.
While a beta-CoV souri key sharing 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a 96% Souri key CoV sharing nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin beta-CoVs were found to be significantly similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the Pangolin may be one of the intermediate hotels or that Pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The CVs have returned under the fires of the bomb due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been in the bedroom for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as this has been done on wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the ongoing outbreaks of MERS, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could arise and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circle in nature.
In particular, key-sourish CVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The culture of consumption of wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, there have been many viruses on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until there is an opportunity for infection.
Continued monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the environment of CVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological nets of natural zoonoses.
Firstly, if the souri key transmits a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the Pangolins, it would be interesting to note what circumstances the souri key and the Pangolins could share the same ecological hazard.
Secondly, if the mouse keys play a more direct role in human transmission, it should determine how humans are in contact with the mouse keys.
Thirdly, if a third mammifer plays the role of real intermediate host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with the different species, including men, mice and pangolins.
Whether it is a sour key, a pangoline or another mammifer, it should be possible to identify the SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hotels.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or rhume, for example by holding hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (e.g. mucous membranes).
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogen agents (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; and reducing respiratory infections;
and the reduction of child mortality rates at home.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diary diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes such as washing hands in soap.
The pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, which is about 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia results in the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
The washing of hands also protects the impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Less delegated effect, the washing often with hands can soften the skin by causing skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive washing of hands could lead to eczema or dermatitis at the level of hands, characterized by skeletal skin and dementia, and particularly common among health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of the Compulsive Obession Disorder (TOC).
Disparasitation twice a year, associated with daily washing hands in soap and brushing teeth with a fluorinated toothbrush, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been implemented successfully in Indonesia.
The main action of knowledge and intelligence is to reduce obstacles to the solution and increase solvency.
Water alone is not an effective cleaning for the skin given that lipids and proteins, which are organic matter of the soil, are difficult to solve in water.
The solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can recover bacteria from previous uses.
Today, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of antibiotics or recommended disinfectants allows for the target of antibiotics.
Consequently, although antibiotics resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial strains, the latter could not be as effective as was announced.
In addition to the tensive and skin-protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) that are used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, with antimicrobial function, and other protection agents (aque vera, vitamins, mendol, plant extracts).A strict analysis of the University of Oregon's public health school indicated that ordinary knowledge was as effective as antibacterial knowledge for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from their hands.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, cold and salty water is more effective than cold and salty water to remove natural oils carrying salts and bacteria.
In contrast to popular belief, however, scientific studies have revealed that the use of teeted water did not contribute to reducing the microbial load on hands.
A disinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most of these are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with an excessive agent such as carbide (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or to a softener such as glycerin in order to obtain a liquid or muscle for greater ease of use and reduce the alcohol-association effect.
The addition of diluent hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERW), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, Rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as champagne.
Hydroalcoolitic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus-type viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of infectious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to treat or cover both hands well.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of micro-organisms; however, they must not replace adequate hand washing unless you have water and soap in your hands.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions can lead to skin drying if the formula is not strengthened by emulsifiers and/or skin hydrating agents.
The alcohol-associating effect may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emulsifiers to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emulsants resulted in much less irritation and dryness of skin than antimicrobial soaps or detectors.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-alcoholic products do not remove the organic material present on their hands, but do nothing but disinfect them.
That is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to avoid the spread of many pathogen agents, since they remain on their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcohol-free disinfectants depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than alcohol-based and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulas using Benzalkonium chloride have presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, to the difference in alcohol, which has been achieved after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse reactions.
The earth or the earth can be more efficient than the water alone, but less than the sand.
What is more, if soil or ashes are contaminated by microorganisms, it is likely to increase the spread of disease instead of freezing.
In addition to soap, the centrifuge is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends that the semen or semen be used as an alternative to the semen when it is not available.
Wash your hands with running water cold or cold.
The current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the temperature of the water does not seem to vary).
To move a generous amount of soap on your hands by pushing them against each other, without forgetting the two hands, between the fingertips and under the corners.
The soap removes skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when they use soap than with water alone.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The action of frying creates friction, which helps to remove the germs of the skin, and further frying takes more germs.
Reincinding enough to current water.
Resurgence in a steaming water pool can lead to recontamination of the hands.
Check with a clean servant or free air.
Washing hands and wet hands are easier to retrace.The most often forgotten areas are the neck, neck, fingertips, and lower corners.
Artificial angles and the vernishing angles may be able to hibernate microorganisms.
hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin drying promotes the appearance of skin lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic options to wash hands when the water of the mine and/or the soap is not available.For example, to use water from a suspended well or from dry and dry soil and/or to burn it if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in rural schools or areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "type-steps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a stopper with a cord, and a pedal allowing a small amount of water to pour on your hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the process of hand hygiene, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to discuss it.
More and more research suggests that paper services are much more hygienic than electrical dryers that are often found in toilets.
After drying and drying hands in hot air, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by 194 per cent on the lung and 254 per cent on the lungs.
The drying of dry hands to dry air resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the lung of 42% and on the lungs of 15%.
After hand drying, the following variations of bacterial numbering were observed:
There are many different dry hands manufacturers, and dry hands have been compared to drying with paper service.
Washing hands with disinfectants is an alternative solution during movements, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions should contain at least 60% of alcohol.
There are electronic devices that send reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
The medical wash of hands must last for at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap and water or ice to soften and freeze each part of the hands.
The hands must be broken against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, paper service must be used to close the robinnet (and open the exit door if possible).
The aim of hand washing in health structures is to remove pathogenic micro-organisms ("gremes") and avoid their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby and al.
after exposure to blood/to biological liquid;
before an aseptic treatment; and
All old people must be removed.
In this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and front arms up to the neck, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
During breast-feeding, it must be avoided that the water on the front arms does not fall to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were achieved in the first 20 per cent of washing and that there was only very few additional benefits to increase the washing rate of hands by more than 35 per cent.
More extensive research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find robins to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite economic options to build wash stations.
However, the low washing rate of hands can also be imputable to tight habits, rather than to lack of soap or water.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can pass from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in manual hygiene campaigns that are carried out to reduce child diseases and mortality.
The World Hand Washing Day is another example of the awareness campaign that seeks to promote the development of behaviors. Following the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji to illustrate the washing of hands.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap washing hands is much more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
At the time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetid ulcers called miasma.
In Germany, for example, exhibitions depicting "good hand washing techniques" were placed on the side of the doors in public toilets and in office buildings and airports.
The expression "if you wash your hands" refers to the refusal of a person to assume responsibility or to be complex about something.
In addition, those who are authorized to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less inclined to give themselves to other “cleaning” compensatory measures such as the volunteer.
Likewise, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing their hands before and after each meal.
and all thoracic pain should be treated in this way, especially at your age.

Because it's the flu season
It should also be stressed that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in virus genes, which are very likely to result from the pressure exerted on the selection, including through the host immune system.
For example, the loss of full ORF4 in the HCov-229E prototype shock can be cited as due to a delegation of two nucleotides.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the souri key and camera viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga presents a simple nucleotide insert, which will trigger a decalation of the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCOVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted on their reservation hotels.
Cases of symptoms or moderate symptoms were detected when the souri keys were infected by CVs, indicating a mutual adaptation between the CVs and the souri keys.
It seemed that the souri keys were well adapted to the CV from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, anomalies in the activation of the pro-inflamatory response in the souri keys effectively reduce the pathology caused by the CVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in the souri key is eliminated by the positive regulation of the receiver inhibiting the natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low rate of expression of molecules of the major complex of class I histocompatibility.
In addition, the high level of reactive derivatives of oxygen (DRO) generated by high metabolic activity of the souri keys could at the same time eliminate the replication of the CV and affect the "relecture" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and lead to highly pathogenic viral shocks when introduced into a new hotel.
More pathogens could also develop by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
So it's not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
The CVs are non pathogens or cause moderate symptoms in their hotels to be reserved such as raw keys and camouflages.
They respond strongly without causing a strong immune response from the hotel.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptotic carriers and what causes serious cases of infection in the human family are present.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of immune response and cytokinic shock; the more immune response is strong, the more pulmonary lesions are severe.
On the other hand, among the asymptotic carriers, the immune response was derived from the replication of the CV.
The same immune response dissociation strategy could have beneficial effects on treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The answer to the interviewer is particularly strong in the souri keys.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of infection to SARS-CoV-2 should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammation is impaired in the souri keys.
Following this reasoning, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of CVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the overall scheme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a beta-CoV souri key sharing 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a 96% Souri key CoV sharing nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While bovine animals and other animals present on the markets have been detected as carriers of identical viruses in SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs were found to be significantly similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the Pangolin may be one of the intermediate hotels or that Pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there is no evidence to indicate that SARS-COV-2 has been designed by man, whether voluntarily or accidentally.
The CVs have returned under the fires of the bomb due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CVs in mice and other animals has greatly changed our perception of the role played by zoonotic origins and animal reserves in the transmission of HCVs to humans.
Many factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are derived from raw materials and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hotels.
Given that SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between people and citizens present on the markets, closure of the free product markets and slaughter of civilians found there could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
According to the same reasoning, Pangolins should be removed from the free product markets in order to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, taking into account the discovery of many beta-CoV lines of Pangolin closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to man by Pangolins and other mammals and, where appropriate, how this transmission occurs, will remain determined in the following studies.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been in the bedroom for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as this has been done on wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the ongoing outbreaks of MERS, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could arise and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circle in nature.
In particular, key-sourish CVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
There is no need for these zoonotic coVs to evolve and recommence, leading to the emergence of more transmissible and/or fatal new coVs in the future.
The culture of consumption of wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the challenges caused by SRAS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and intervention plan should be developed.
In fact, there have been many viruses on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until there is an opportunity for infection.
Although the souri keys present many features that are conducive to the spread of viruses, the likelihood of man being in contact with the souri keys and other wild species may be minimised if people are sensitive to the need to stay away.
Continued monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the environment of CVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological nets of natural zoonoses.
We don't know all the secrets of the zoonotic origin of SRAS-CoV-2.
Firstly, if the souri key transmits a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the Pangolins, it would be interesting to note what circumstances the souri key and the Pangolins could share the same ecological hazard.
Secondly, if the mouse keys play a more direct role in human transmission, it should determine how humans are in contact with the mouse keys.
Thirdly, if a third mammifer plays the role of real intermediate host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with the different species, including men, mice and pangolins.
Finally, given that many mammals, including domestic animals, are capable of contracting SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it is a sour key, a pangoline or another mammifer, it should be possible to identify the SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hotels.
Future research in this area will lead to the elimination of SARS-CoV-2's evolutionary trajectory in animals and will have an important impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
An update of COVID-19 'Supported Cases' and 'Reconfirmed Cases' diagnostic criteria is necessary
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick recommendation directive for the diagnosis and treatment of the new Coronavirus infection 2019 (2019nCoV) and described our experience and provided references to combating this pandemic at the global level.
However, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge progress gradually on the basis of the results of the ongoing studies and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this e-mail, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "supposed case" and "confirmed case" in accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name of Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), and the virus has been called severe acute respiratory syndrome to Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified for the COVID-19 pandemic.
In order to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team made a quick recommendation that was published online on military medical research on February 06, 2020.
She has been very careful since her publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and our knowledge gradually progress on the basis of the results of the ongoing studies and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.hnc.gov.cn/) were published seven editions in total between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which were substantially modified.
Our directive, which received a comment from Zhou and al, presented a simple assessment proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference to this global pandemic.
We welcome their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated in accordance with the latest CVID-19 Diagnostics and Treatment Directives (seventh version test) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspected case must associate one of the characteristics of epidemiological ancestors with two elements of clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or should correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological ancestors:
epidemiological precedents: (1) a travel or residence precedent in Wuhan City and in nearby areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported during the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (2) a contact history with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nuclear acid); (3) a contact history with patients presenting HIV or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan or nearby areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported during the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (4) an incident with cases of HIV/AIDS (containing cases with cases of infection) and cases of infection with HIV/nurst. (4)
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) picture showing the characteristics of an infection in COVID-19 ; (3) total number of white globes indicating normal, reduced or reduced number of lymphocytes since the start of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case must be based on the suspicion of any of the following elements of pathological or serological evidence: (1) a real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2 ; (2) a sequence of the entire viral gene showing strong homogeneity with the new known coronaviruses; (3) a positive serological test for the IgM and IgG antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 ; or a modification of the specific IgG antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 resulting in a negative positive or increase of the title ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to the appropriate phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nuclear acids in respiratory or blood recovery has been added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic blood sampling was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and to the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then the serologic evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to find an optimal set of nuclear acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory samples including blood collection, with increased availability of different species, and contributed to the positive outcome of the specific antibodies in the confirmed criteria.
Moreover, more and more evidence reminds us of the caution with regard to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
As a result, the graphic representation of Zhou and al should be updated, given that they did not present clinical symptoms such as “low risk”.
The evaluation system should also be checked in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope for more direct evidence and ask readers to submit their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "susceptible cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that they follow and respect the latest guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in time to provide its assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to COVID-19 in one day.
The country thus records a death record due to the virus in one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IEDCR) indicated that the number of registered infected persons included 114 active cases and 33 cured persons, who were confined to their homes.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was due to end on Saturday 4 April.
The transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was still permitted.
On March 19, these three persons were already reunited.
Today, the total number of cases of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has exceeded one million in the world, according to data from the University of Johns Hopkins.
Around the world, countries have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of disease.
Thursday, Sergei Sobayinin, the capital of Moscow, extended the city's border until 1 May.
The Portuguese Parliament voted for the extension of the 15-day national emergency status; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, with ten abstentions and one vote against.
Zonetic origins of human coronavirus
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the tendency to reveal where HCOV infection could be devastating and potentially fatal.
Most HCOVs come from raw keys that are not pathogens.
The intermediate reservations of some HCOV are also known.
The identification of animal hotels has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of CV-hotel interactions in animals could also help better understand CV in humans.
According to the differences in protein sequences, CVs are classified in four species (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The Beta-CoV species contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that rats and rodents play the role of genetic sources for most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reserve of gamma-CoV and Delta-CoV.
To date, seven human CoV (HCoV) are known.
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoV includes HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The trace of the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework to understand the natural history, the motor forces and the restrictive factors of the fragmentation of the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the host(s) reserve, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the prevention of future infections.
The CV animals have been known since the end of the 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCOVs have been identified.
The first HCOV-229E strain was isolated in the respiratory pathways of patients presenting a higher respiratory infection in 1966, and then adapted to grow in lung cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of classical rhomme, including headaches, everlastings, malaises and throats, with fever and all observed in 10 to 20 per cent of cases.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both present in the world and seem to be mainly broadcast in winter in climate-critical countries.
Stores in Australia reduce the limited quantities of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian stores chain Woolworths and Coles reduced their purchase restrictions on two-to-two toilet paper and a package per purchase in all stores at the national level, respectively.
Monday, ALDI also introduced a package limit.
These limits have been displayed in the form of messages to the cascades and on the channels' Facebook pages.
Buyers apparently collected reservations for COVID-19 and the need to limit themselves.
Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchases of toilet paper for home delivery to a package by order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages by purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of 8 March, said that with the restriction of four packages in force, "many stores are always in stock breaking at the time following delivery", and qualified the "unforeseen" application, while ALDI, in a publication on Facebook on Tuesday, described it as "unexpected".
Sales have known a "strong increase" last week, according to a Woolworths portal.
The Costco store in Canberra has also limited the amount allowed to two packages last week.
In order to reduce the shortage further, Coles ordered larger packages to suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made stocks available earlier for a planned Wednesday promotion.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Association of Details, said that the details were trying to increase stocks, but that the restrictions of the local council on truck delivery hours made the task difficult.
It provides for an increase in production costs, while suppliers are trying to respond to the demand, and less promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the planned decommissioning of stocks, some stores are unable to honour the promotion of mercury.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert from the department of the distribution of the University of Technology of Queensland, explained that stores provide stock every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a volumeless article, involving stockings of a small amount that, once forced, leave large spaces alive in the radius, strengthening the impression of a pendulum.
“ Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, this will probably reduce panic," Russell Zimmerman explained to ABC News.
The recycled paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday they were breaking stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper who manufactures Sorbent paper, stressed that they work 24/7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, an real estate site, indicated that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first customer at the end of the day in Melbourne, while less sales at the end were organized because the buyers were retired during the long weekend of the work party.
The daily edition of NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page booklet designed to be printed and used as toilet paper.
Stores were reluctant at first to impose restrictions, according to ABC Australia's 3 March report in which they announced that they did not intend to introduce restrictions on purchase.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also knew a strong demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed Sunday night that the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of paper toilet Andres to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization Qualifies the COVID-19 of the pandemic
Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) has qualified the current COVID-19 epidemic (the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.
Although the word "pandemia" refers only to the degree of spread of the disease and not to the danger of specific cases, the WHO indicated the need to move governments to action:
“All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries reject, try, treat, isolate, localize and mobilize their populations in response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO.
"We are very concerned, not only by alarming levels of propaganda and severity, but also by alarming levels of action."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centres, the pandemic is “unforeseen”.
He stated in a report published by CNN in February that “in addition to the flu, no other respiratory virus has been observed since its appearance until its continued spread worldwide.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, saying that "we have never been witnesses of a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
He added: "And we have never been witnesses of a pandemic that can be mastered at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an emergency of public health at international level.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said of the epidemic: "To do so quickly, the situation will end."
Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 in the world, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 Coronavirus pandemic is a disease epidemic of coronavirus since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an emergency of public health at international level on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
On 10 April 2020, some 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The literacy rate is estimated at 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Current symptoms include fever, all of them and swelling.
The complications may include acute respiratory depression and pneumonia.
The time between exposure and appearance of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can be oscillated between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to touch, staying away from other people, as well as monitoring and restricting suspects to be infected.
The authorities of the world have responded by establishing restrictions on movements, quarantines, fire covers, risk controls on workplaces and institutions.
The pandemic has caused serious socio-economic disturbances at the global level, reports or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, as well as generalized losses caused by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed at national or local level in 193 countries, reaching about 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
False information about the virus has been circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese people, other people from East and South-East Asia, as well as other persons from regions that have many cases of the virus.
As a result of the decline in heavy travel and closures in the industry, there has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported a case-by-case pneumonia incident on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was opened in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the large market of Huanan sea fruits and therefore it is thought that the virus would be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic is SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered and closely related virus associated with souri key viruses, pangoline coronary virus, and SARS-CoV. Consequently, it was found that the first known person who had symptoms was sick on 1 December 2019, and that person had no apparent link to the subsequent free product market.
In the case of the first plant reported in December 2019, the two thirds had a market link.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could be resumed on 17 November 2019 at a 55-year-old person in the province of Hubei. On 26 February 2020, WHO indicated that, as new cases seemed to decrease in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases for the first time.
There could be a strong underestimation of cases, including those with positive symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, 19 years of age and less than 2.4 per cent of the world's cases.
Cases refer to the number of persons tested in COVID-19 and whose test was confirmed positive under official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those who presented only positive symptoms such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that in China, up to 23 January, 86 per cent of undetected COVID-19 infections were estimated and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79 per cent of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The first estimates of the baseline production rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Control and Prevention Centres concluded that there could be 5.7.
Most people affected by COVID-19 are getting better.
For those who do not recover, the time between the occurrence of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most current of which is 14 days.
On 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were due to COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were related to more than 60 years of age, and 75 per cent suffered from pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular and diabetes. Official death accounts related to the CVID-19 pandemic generally refer to dead persons who have been tested positive for CVID under official protocols.
The number of actual victims of COVID-19 could be much higher, as it could not include untested dead persons - e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partly data from Italy show that the mortality figures during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official count of deaths of COVID.
A U.S. Health Control and Prevention Centre spokesman (CDC) acknowledged "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is underestimated", a statement confirmed by anecdotic reports of the sub-assessment in the United States. Such sub-assessment is often carried out in pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine flu epidemic of 2009. The first confirmed death took place in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia took place in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than one dozen deaths per country were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On March 13, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary according to the regions and with time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time elapsed since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-decess report represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to statistics from the University of Johns-Hopkins, the global incidence report is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) to 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimates of the case-related report decreased by 17.3% (for those with symptoms occurring between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms reported after 1 February 2020). Other indicators are the rate of fatality (heat rate), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease, and the rate of infection (infection rate), which represents the percentage of people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who suffer from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of Oxford University estimates that the rate of infection for pandemic in its overall population is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this survey is consistent with the results of the first COVID-19 randomized tests in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of the tests on the estimates of the literacy rate.
WHO supports that pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of the University of Pennsylvania stated: "Without control, infectious diseases usually stabilize and then begin to regress when the disease is missing from available hotels.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant forecasts at the moment when this will happen."
The chief medical adviser to the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, said that "this could end in June" if all countries are able to mobilize themselves to follow WHO's recommendations on measures to reduce the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &mp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for one or two years".
According to a study of the Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (in 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus—because it transmits very easily—is completely disappearing" and that "it could turn into seasonal disease, which can recover every year."
The violence of this return would depend on collective immunity and the extent of change.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and people infected may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dryness (68%).
Current symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosities), loss of appetite, esophageal, muscle and articular pain, throat pain, headaches, chills, vomiting, haemoptysia, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO claims that about one person in six is seriously ill and has respiratory difficulties.
The U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centres (CDC) identify emergency symptoms such as persistent respiratory difficulty, pain or thoracic pressure, soda confusion, difficult reveales, and face or liver problems; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The subsequent evolution of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, severe respiratory syndrome, septicemia, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected persons may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results confirming the infection, then researchers have made recommendations that persons with close contact with infected persons should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
The Chinese assessment of the asymptotic ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the period between contamination and the occurrence of symptoms) is oscillating between one and 14 days; it is more often than five days. An example of uncertainty is the estimate of the proportion of COVID-19 pregnant persons who lost their appetite was initially 30% before fall to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly through close contact and by tasteless ends produced by touching, interfering, or speaking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies revealed that anyone without protection can design jewellery at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by thinning ends that would remain in the air for longer periods, which could be designed during speech. The respiratory tract can also be designed during breathing, including speaking, whatever the virus is not generally airported.
Postillons can be landed in the mouth or nose of other persons placed next to them or even trapped in the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as incubation and cardiopulmonary reanimation (RCP) may cause respiratory secrets that are pulverised and therefore result in air-producing.
He can also repent when someone touches a contaminated surface, including his skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that they can be transmitted by seals, this risk is considered to be low.
The Government of China has excluded the possibility of an oral SARS-CoV-2 feco-oral transmission. The virus is more contagious during the first three days following the start of symptoms, but the spread may be possible before symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People were tested positive for disease up to three days prior to the occurrence of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few signs of symptoms confirmed in the laboratory exist, but the asymptotic transmission has been detected by some countries during contact research.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if we don't know exactly what the disease is going on with, one person in general is infected with two to three others.
In particular, the virus could be detected at the end of three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on the carton, and at the end of four hours on the cover.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Domestic animals and other animals were tested positive to COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but the British authorities recommend that they wash their hands after touching animals, such as after contact with other areas where infected persons may have been affected.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three persons with pneumonia related to Wuhan's acute respiratory disease.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the coronaviruses that appear in nature. Inside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household snake, which dissipates its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
We think it'd be a zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus belongs genetically to the Betacoronavirus subgeneral Sarbecovirus (Linger B) associated with two strains of souri keys.
It is the same as 96% of the total of the gene of another sample of souri key virus (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid differential in some parts of the sequences of the gene between pangoline viruses and humans.
The comparison of the entire gene showed a maximum of 92% of common genetic material between the coronavirus of the pangoline and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
The virus infection may be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, but final confirmation is performed by reverse transcription of the chain reaction by polymerase (rRT-PCR) of infected or scand secrets.
A study comparing the PCR and the Wughan scanner suggested that the scanner is much more sensitive than the PCR, which is less precise, as many of its imaging functions are consistent with other pneumonies and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "the scanner is not used to detect or test the first intention to diagnose the COVID-19".
The WHO has published several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first appearance on 17 January.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on breathing or blood.
Results are generally available within a few hours or days.
This test is generally carried out on a rhinopharynx removal but can also be used for a gorilla removal. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of them appeared reliable enough to be approved for generalised use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of the radiographs and tomodensity (scan) of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral
The Italian Radiology Society is currently an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to the accumulation with other infections such as adénovirus, the unconfirmed imagery by PCR is limited to detect COVID-19.
An important study in China compared the results of the thoracic scanners to the PCR and showed that if imagery is less precise for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, prejudging its view as a testing tool in epidemic areas.
Convulsive neuron networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the characteristics of the virus in the image both on radiographs and scanners.
Disease prevention strategies include overall good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and touching or putting the meat into a mouth and throwing it directly into a powder bag.
It was recommended that those who had already been contaminated carry a public surgical mask.
Physical distance measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have prohibited or advised all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of Community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus expands into communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how it has been contaminated, and health professionals are advised to take care of someone who might be infected to take normal care and contact precautions, and to carry out protection nets.
The use of localization data by Governments in this regard raised confidentiality problems, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a communication calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications were launched or proposed on the basis of volunteers, and by 7 April 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts were working on relevant private life solutions, such as Bluetooth's use to record a user's presence near other portable phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in contact with someone who has been tested positively to COVID-19. False ideas are currently circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, cutting the nose and garnishing with oral bath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently trying to develop one.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often in soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after they have been in toilets or when their hands are visiblely salted; before they eat; and after they have moved, pushed, or ever.
Because outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective cover.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based disinfectant containing at least 60 % alcohol when soap and water are not easily accessible.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces can be detached in several ways (in a minute of exposure to disinfectant for an stainless steel surface), including ethanol 62-71%, isopropanol 50-100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and hydrogen iodine iodine 0.2-7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an institution such as an office building or crèche, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, telecoms, and automatic distributors used by sick persons are disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with their flat throat or a muscle when they touch or ever, and to expel any muscle immediately.
The surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance along by the posterilons designed by speaking, talking and touching.
WHO has issued instructions explaining where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Bringing a mask can reduce people's ability to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection without good hygiene."The use of masks has also been recommended to those who are potentially affected by the disease.
WHO recommended the port of masks for healthy people only if they are at risk, for example if they are dealing with CVID-19 disease, even if they recognize that the port of masks can help people not to touch the face.
Several countries have started encouraging their people to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the port of non-medical masks in tissue. China specifically recommended the use of medical masks for healthy people, especially in the case of proximity (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or bound places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage the population to manufacture facial masks at home and to clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have prohibited public exits without mask or other means of covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the port of masks worldwide in public places, so that everyone would protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government ordered that everyone entering a supermarket carry a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to carry a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, imposed the port of masks for interurban train and bus passengers on 1 April.
Panama has made the port of a mask mandatory for all exits, while recommending the manufacture of an artificial mask to those who cannot buy it.
The masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also called physical distance) includes measures to control infections intended to slow the spread of the disease by reducing contact between people.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and commercial centres.
The social distance methods can be applied to stay at home by limiting their journeys, avoiding crowds, by greeting them without contact and by keeping a physical distance with others.
Many governments now order or recommend social distance in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of meetings recommended by U.S. government and health agencies has been rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there is no known presence of CVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and 10 persons later.
On March 22, 2020, Germany has banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or reduced immune system are aware of an increased risk of serious disease and complications. They were therefore invited by the CDC to stay home as far as possible in areas affected by the epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the term "social distance" by "physical distance" to clarify the objective of reducing physical contact while maintaining social ties.
The use of the term "social distance" meant that it was necessary to use a total social isolation instead of encouraging people to keep contact with other means. Some authorities published guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation that you have no sexual relations with a person with whom you live, who has no virus or does not have any symptoms.
Home isolation has been recommended for people diagnosed positive to COVID-19 and those who are expected to be infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for correct isolation. Many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to members of the most risky groups.
Persons exposed to COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where the transmission is very important have been invited to sit in quarantine for 14 days from the time they were last exposed.
The control strategies of an epidemic are the end or removal, and the delay.
The endpoint is established during the first stages of the epidemic and aimed at monitoring and isolation of infected persons, as well as introducing other measures to control infections and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts turn towards the phase of mitigation: measures are taken to slow down this spread and reduce its effects on the health care system and society.
End-up and delay measures may be taken at the same time.
The removal requires more extreme measures, in order to focus the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. One part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is to try to reduce the epidemic peak: this is what is called the spread of the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and making time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, mask port and individual quarantine; public social distance measures such as closure of schools and religious offices; public efforts to encourage the acceptance and participation of such interventions; as well as environmental actions such as cleaning of the surfaces. More drastic measures to address the epidemic have been taken in China since its severity has become apparent, such as the introduction of entire cities and a strict ban on travel.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced localized mass testing and assessments, and has issued warnings on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to persons infected in quarantine and affected those who did not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and has punished medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that slowing down (the slowdown but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and removing (reversing the development of the epidemic) pose major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce the demand for health care of 2/3 and half of deaths, but can not prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are subject.
The removal may be privileged, but should be continued for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it occurs first), because the transmission is rapidly reopened when the measures are released.
Long-term intervention to remove the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no antiviral treatments approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including existing treatment tests.
Taking medicines without order against rhumm or consumption of alcohol and rest can help alleviate the symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several components that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of CVID-19.
The WHO stated that some "traditional and artistic remedies" may cause symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and health care adaptation to the needs of CVID-19 patients is described by WHO as a key response measure to the epidemic.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines on the care of primary health care hospitals and services for the redeployment of resources at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to CVID-19 tests, by canceling non-required interventions where possible, by separation and isolation of patients with positive CVID-19 tests, and by strengthening the capacity of intensive care by training staff and by increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are different theories about the origin of the first case (called zero patient).
The first known case of the new Coronavirus could be rebuilt on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan in the province of Hubei in China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are generally linked to the large market of Huanan sea fruits, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An unknown cause pneumonia facility was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei province hospital, which informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan's central hospital warned their colleagues of a "coronavirus similar to SRAS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were tortured by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was tortured by his superiors for warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public opinion on 31 December and informed the WHO.
There were enough cases of an unknown pneumonia reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation in January. In the first stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled about every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by the New Chinese Year's migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport pool and a major railway station.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases one day, including two persons in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States exceeded China and Italy by showing the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1,61 million cases were reported worldwide; over 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 were cured.
About 200 countries and territories had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted their movements and established border controls.
National reactions included mitigation measures such as quarantines (also called house arrests, on-site or border crossings) and fire cover. On 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, were subjected to a detention form in the United States, over 50 million people were confined to the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world knew a form of detention, a figure rising to 2.6 billion two days later — about a third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was given on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would be rebuilt on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an unknown cause pneumonia case on 26 December, which she informed Wuhan Jianghan's CDC on 27 December.
The initial genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a similar coronavirus in SRAS.
A public opinion was delivered by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan received a warning to have "proclaimed rumors" about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "expressive evidence" of human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a "war of the people" to end the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the largest set in human history's history," a health cord was announced on 23 January to stop the journeys since and for Wuhan, which has been extended to 15 cities in Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
Private vehicles were prohibited in the city.
The New Year's celebrations (January 25th) were canceled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was then built: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to new hospitals, China has converted 14 other structures into Wuhan, such as conventions and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.

South Korea introduced what was considered to be the largest and most organized programme in the world to test the population through the virus, and isolate all infected persons as well as to monitor and quarantine those who were in contact with them.
Test methods included mandatory individual reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile applications, virus testing drivers delivering the next day's results, and increased testing capacity to allow the test of nearly 20,000 people per day.
The South Korea programme was considered a success in the control of the epidemic, although it did not take into account the entire cities. The South Korean society was initially divided on the response of President Moon Jae-in to the crisis.

The United Kingdom's response to the virus first appears to be one of the most flexible among the affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British Government has imposed no social distance or mass measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government was criticized for its manifest lack of activity and viability in response to public concerns.

WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in the management and eradication of the epidemic.
The WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SRAS epidemic, where Chinese authorities were accused of dissipation by preventing efforts to prevent and end up, and the current crisis in which the central government "has provided regular reports to prevent panic in the wake of the New Year's Day".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a movement ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that although it was not "certainly not a recommendation of the WHO", it was a "very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and spoke of an "unforeseen fact in public health history". On 30 January, following confirmation of an inter-human transmission outside China and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO stated that the epidemic was an emergency public health measure of the International PI inflow of the Influenza.
The Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom, stated that the USPPI was responsible for "a risk of global proliferation, particularly for low-income and intermediate-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of movement restrictions, Tedros stated: "There is no reason why measures are ineffective with international trade travel and trade" and "the WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movements".
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute up to $675 million in order to finance strategic preparation in low-income countries, calling for the urgent support of those countries "who do not have the necessary systems to detect those who contracted the virus, even if it was on the point of arrival".
Tedros then said that we were "as strong as our weakest email" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more tomorrow". On 11 February, WHO held a press conference on the name of COVID-19.

Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Management Programme, said in a statement: "It is a return to reality for each Government of the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you must be ready," adding that good response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan then pointed out that current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that "we absolutely agree that every person on the planet is exposed to this virus".
On 11 March, WHO stated that the cancer epidemic could be qualified for pandemic.
The Director-General noted that WHO was "very concerned at both alarming levels of spread and severity and alarming levels of intervention". WHO faced important criticisms about its management of pandemic, inadequately judged, in particular due to the late statement of public health emergency and the classification of virus as pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition urging the Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom, to postpone his resignation, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts highlighted the respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Several provincial administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) have been removed from their functions following their management of the quarantine in central China, a sign of discontent towards the response of political officials to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from popular anger in relation to the Coronavirus epidemic.
Some high Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that the Coronavirus epidemic would have started in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories that COVID-19 would have its origins in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. Administration of Donald Trump has qualified the crownavirus of "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying that in China "the censorship has now become a global pandemic", which has been taxed by some opponents and is intended to "turn the attention of its administration's inability to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast sought a telegram from the U.S. government showing the large lines of a communication strategy apparently from the National Security Council, whose strategy is as follows: "All come from China.

Press bodies such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg said that China's efforts to send assistance to countries affected by the virus were part of a campaign to gain influence at the global level.
EU foreign policy leader Joseph Borrell said there was "a geopolitical component involving a fight for influence through rhetoric and gender policy".
Borrell also stated that "China insists aggressively on the fact that, unlike the United States, she is a responsible and reliable partner."

The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-placed political source" which indicated that 80 percent of Russian aid was "not useful for Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive "goopolitical and diplomatic" charm.
The President of Lombardy, Attlio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio deplored the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a medical aid aircraft to the United States.
The spokesman for Kremlin Dmitri Peskov stated that “by offering his assistance to his fellow Americans, [Poutine] is part of the principle that when American manufacturers of equipment and medical equipment have won the speed, they will be able to do the same if necessary.”

The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticised the year 2020: "In the current public health crisis, not only the lives of American troops and many European countries involved, but also those of the people of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with almost twenty members of Parliament infected, as well as 15 other old or current political personalities.
Iran's President Hassan Rohani wrote an open letter to world leaders to ask for assistance on 14 March 2020 indicating that his country was in danger of fighting the epidemic because of lack of access to international markets due to the United States sanctions against Iran. The epidemic prompted United States calls for common social policies to be adopted in other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal childcare programme, a paid parental leave and a higher level of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to adversely affect Donald Trump's election chances at the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated because of the pandemic.
South Korea has criticised Japan's "imbiguous and passive efforts" after it last announced that any person arriving from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks on sites designated by the Government.
The South Korean society was at the start of the split response to the crisis of President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be charged with mismanagement of the epidemic by the Government or otherwise in favour of its response. The pandemic has enabled countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern about the fact that this might allow Governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to authorize Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by order until the new order, suspend Parliament and the elections and punish anyone who would have been accused of spreading false information about the virus and crisis management by the Government.
Coronavirus epidemic has been accused of several cases of supply interruptions, resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases and interruption of the functioning of factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Medical Agency has issued warnings about drug and medical losses due to increased demand for consumers and the interruption of suppliers.
A number of localities have also faced panic purchases that have led to the disappearance of first-time products such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, radios, leading to injuries.
The technology sector, in particular, has warned of delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the application for individual protection equipment has been multiplied by 100.
This request has led to an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and has also resulted in delays in the provision of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also resulted in a shortage of individual protection equipment around the world and WHO warns that this will put health professionals at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has offered a new opportunity to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a child milk shortage in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and in the Wuhan region, and the strong demand for food products that followed, these two areas have been spared from serious food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against illegal storage and trade in essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding the serious food shortages that have been foreseen in Europe and North America.
As a result of its important agricultural production, Italy in the North did not find significant reductions, but prices could increase according to industry representatives.
Food rations have been empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while members of the Chinese Government have blocked reserves of pigs to ensure sufficient survival of the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy so that food producers can store reserves for such emergencies.

Many events related to the New Year have been canceled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the prohibited city of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year's holidays until 10 February, making it difficult for most of the workplaces not to open before that date.
These regions represented 80 per cent of GDP in the country and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has gone through its highest level of response to infectious diseases and has declared an emergency situation, closing schools until March and canceling its New Year's festivals. The distribution sector has been affected at the world level, with reduced opening hours of shops or temporary closures.
Visits to trade unions in Europe and Latin America have dropped by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders found a decrease of 50 to 60 per cent.
This also resulted in a 33 to 43 per cent drop in pedestrian traffic in commercial centres in March compared to February.
The operators of commercial centres around the world have imposed additional measures, such as the increase in cleaning frequencies, the installation of thermal scanners to control customer temperature and the cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million additional people in extreme poverty in Latin America as a result of a pandemic-free situation.
In January and February 2020, during the outbreak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large part of the nearly 300 million rural migrant workers were blocked from their homes in interior provinces or congested in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
Coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates. The restriction in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (with a daily salary) to unemployment. Angus Reid’s survey showed that 44 per cent of Canadian households had experienced some type of unemployment. Nearly 900 000 workers lost their employment in Spain since the ban imposed on mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies had their salaries transferred to a part-time activity facility sponsored by the government called Kurzwark.
The German part-time work compensation system was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The arts sectors of the exhibition and cultural heritage were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both employed and independent, at the global level.
Arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often funded by the State) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, to ensure the safety of their employees and the public and to support artists as often as possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition halls and other cultural institutions were closed to a new order and their exhibitions, events and representations canceled or reported.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sports events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion gaps.
The film industry was also known as an interruption. The Vatican announced that the celebration of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place last week of the period of Christian imprisonment in the Caremé, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses recommended that older Christians stay with them rather than attend Sunday Mass; some churches distribute their religious services on radio, online and on-line or on television while others offer to practice their worship in "drive-in".
In view of the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome which closed its churches and its chapels and the place Saint-Pierre which was seen from all its Christian pilgrims, other religious authorities also canceled their services and limited public meetings in the churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gardraars.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the sacred places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia forbade the entry of foreign pilgrims and its residents to the sacred sites of La Mecque and Médine.
The pandemic has caused the most significant interruption of the world's sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sports events have been cancelled or reported, including the EUFA 2019-20 Championships League, the 2019-20 United Kingdom Football Championship, the EUFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 LNH season.
The epidemic disturbed the organisation of the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which had to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020 but not later than 2021". The casinos and other world-wide games facilities have closed and live poker tournaments have been reported either cancelled or cancelled.
This has prompted many players to register online, and many online games sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new subscriptions. The world of the show has also been touched with several music groups that have suspended or cancelled their concerts.
Many great theaters, such as those in Broadway, have also interrupted all their representations.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in place of traditional direct representations, such as online and online concerts or online "festivals" for artists to produce, distribute and promote their works.
Online, many Internet games on the subject of coronavirus have been promoted because many prefer the light and distraction to uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, a census of prejudices, xenophobia and racism has been found against people of Chinese and East Asia, and people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Pacific, there have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility.
Reports dating from February (when most of the cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world that Chinese deserved the virus or received justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese feelings.
Many Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support was provided to the Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the inhabitants of the areas affected by the virus.
Following the progress of the epidemic towards new sensitive countries, Italians living in Europe's first country to experience a severe epidemic of COVID-19 could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have at first signed petitions to prevent Chinese people from entering their countries to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has become angry on Twitter.
The Chinese and other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in racist levels of abuse and aggression.
American President Donald Trump faced criticism of qualifying the "Chinese virus" crownavirus, a term considered by his dictators as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses transporting Ukrainians and foreign evacuations between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhari.
Indigenous students from the North-East of India, who share a border with China, and studying in large Indian cities, would have been under harassment in connection with the Coronavirus epidemic.
The President of the Western Bengal Unit of Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God took his revenge on them."
The notes were then condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Kolkata, which defines them as "false". In China, Xenophoby and racism against non-Chinese people were attacked by the pandemic, foreigners being described as "foreign waste" which should "remove".
Many access journals have withdrawn them for all or part of their cover on the coronavirus.
Many scientific editors have made their scientific articles available in connection with the free access epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on publishing servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory study of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods of detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus ARN.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only the ARN of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests reveal how many people contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms were too light to be reported or those who were symptomatic.
An exact mortality rate of disease and collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population and there were significant differences in the number of tests performed in each country.
It is likely that this variable affects significantly the reported fertility rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
By using reverse transcription followed by a real-time reaction of real-time polymerisation (rRT-PCR), the test can be carried out on respiratory samples obtained using different methods, including nasopharyngal orexpectoration.
The results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test carried out from pharyngous ecuvolons is only reliable during the first week of the disease.
The virus can then disappear from the throat while it continues its multiplication into the lungs.
In infected persons tested during the second week, a sample can also be taken in deep respiratory pathways by breathing catheter of breath, or a crack (expectoration) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charity in Berlin in January 2020 through a reverse transcription followed by a real-time real-time polymerisation reaction (rRT-PCR) and was the basis of 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenbiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 clinical quality detection kit based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive an emergency authorisation from the Chinese National Administration of Medical Products for a SARS-CoV-2-based detection kit based on PCR.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, distribute their diagnosis by RT-PCR in real time of the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories via the International Reasource.
Among the old versions of the test kits, a genetic test of three was obtained with non-conformity results due to defective reactions, as well as an extraterrestrial test hole at the Atlanta CDC. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout the month of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and this is only when federal and local laboratories were authorized to begin the investigation.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorisation.The U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced availability at the national level of COVID-19 test based on RT-PCR.
This Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests at national level on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restriction has been announced. The collection and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR National Research Centre for virology and Biotechnology.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Supervisory Service. On 12 March 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed an infection detection test at COVID-19.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA authorisation for a test that could be performed in large quantities at 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform approximately 4 128 tests at 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an emergency authorisation (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on the Abbott m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted similar authorisations to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepid also received an EUA from the FDA for a 45-minute test.
The FDA approved a test using the isothermal amplification technology of nuclear acids instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of different temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to step up the production to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibodies specifically related to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new Coronavirus is under development in Taiwan, hoping it can deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes, such as a quick flu test.
A bibliographic study of March 2020 concluded that “pulmonary radiographs present a low diagnostic value at the first stages, while the results of the TDM [tomodensity] can be concluded even before symptoms appear. ”
Among the typical symptoms visible on the TDM are multi-lobar bilateral depletion of glass with a peripheral, asymmetric and lateral distribution.
A sub-pleural predominance, a "crazy paving" and a consolidation are developing as the disease evolves.
A study comparing TDM to Wughan, from the origin of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly more sensitive than PCR, which is less specific, several of its imagery results associated with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the American Institute of Radiology recommends that "the TDM should not be used for testing or as a first line test to diagnose COVID-19".In March 2020, the CDC recommends the PCR for initial testing.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from around 7 days after symptoms appear, to determine immunity and population monitoring.The tests can be performed in central laboratories (TLC) or by test at the patient’s head (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
High-density automated systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of carrying out these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, only one peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For the PoCT, one sample of blood is generally taken by skin point.
Unlike the PCR methods, no extraction step is required prior to the analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities duly informed the Agency and can therefore now distribute their antibodies testing tests.
On 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under emergency authorisation.In March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is much faster than the VR PCR test.
Antibodys are generally detectable 14 days after the start of the infection.In April, the United Kingdom found that none of the test kits for antibodies purchased by the country were sufficient to be used.
Hong Kong has set up a plan in which suspicious cases can remain at home, "the emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube", patients break inside, send it back and receive the test result later.The British NHS announced that it is carrying out a pilot project to test suspects at home, which removes the risk that a patient is not infected by a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.In the case of COVID-19, a health professional collects a sample by taking appropriate precautions.
The driving centres enabled South Korea to carry out one of the fastest and most extensive tests in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Doctors of Compulsory Health Insurance stated on 2 March that it had the ability to carry out some 12,000 tests per day in the ambulance and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are borne by disease insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, driving tests were available in several large cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that at the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of 483,295 samples were tested up to 12/2020 and that 33,491 samples (6.9 %) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, technicians and Rambam hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of 64 patients at the same time, combining samples and conducting only if the combined sample was positive.
Through its construction in 5 days supervised by Wang Jian, BGI founder, modelling revealed that cases in the province of Hubei would have been 47 per cent higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this testing capacity.
Wuhan's laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai in 12 Chinese cities in total.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity was up to 50,000 tests per day.The free models developed by Origami Assays were published to test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without liquid-manufactured robot.
In March, insufficient losses and quantities of reactives became an exceptional cause for mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was currently testing most of its population per capita for Coronavirus, and that the census was being intensified to reach the majority of the population.
These results have been obtained through a combination of the ability to drive and purchase high-density laboratory at Group 42 and BGI (based on their emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of carrying tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside China.
Various test formulas targeting different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula to produce kits sent to low-income countries without the resources needed to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020. The Protocol developed by the U.S. Disease Control Centres was published only on 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of the test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and those countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits to respond to the request and recommendations for testing of health experts.
On the other hand, experts point out that the high availability of tests in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The research capacity, mostly in the private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean Government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of research programmes as the best way to slow down the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The strong demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and the reserves of ecuvillons and chemical reactors were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the CDC test kits were "mistakes".The government then removed bureaucratic barriers that hindered private testing.Spain bought test kits with the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but it seemed that the results were not reliable.
The company explained that the wrong results could be linked to the inability to collect samples or to use kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry has stated that it will remove the kits with the wrong results and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased in China by the Czech Republic have produced false results. Slovakia has purchased 1.2 million test kits that have been missing.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested to throw them into the Danube. Atesh Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health stated that the test kits that Turkey bought in China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them". The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits in China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were useless.
The survey, followed by the 40th of those who have achieved positive results and the traceability of those who have been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, has yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vó, the place of the first death associated with COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two trials with the total population of about 3,400 people, at about ten days of interval.
Nearly half of the people with a positive outcome did not have symptoms, and all cases were detected in quarantine.
With the restriction of movement in the community, this measure has completely eliminated the new infections.
Thanks to aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on entry travel, testing and quarantine, the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much faster than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail sales facilities.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began to advise residents to stay with them on 28 March, but schools went to the date scheduled for the end of the holidays on 23 March.
A number of other countries have also managed the pandemic through aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on entry travel, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive restrictions, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has found that countries that have carried out most of the tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower fatality rates, probably because these countries are more suitable to detect people with mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no analytical capacity and national laboratories have only a limited experience with CVID-19 send their first five positive samples and ten negative CVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to carry out confirmatory tests.
Among the 16 reference laboratories are 7 in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the 'Postive in % of Tests' column depends on national research policy.
A country that does not test that people admitted to the hospital will have a positive value in % of higher tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they present symptoms, the other factors are the same.
The washing of hands, also called the hygiene of hands, is to wash your hands in order to remove salts, fat, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted via ear-feckal.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or rhume, for example by holding hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (e.g. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands in the soap at five key moments of the day: before and after the disappearance, after cleaning the feet of a baby or changing its beds, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling of meat, fish or crustaceans.
If you don't have water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands in the oven. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after preparation of meals;
before and after the occupation of a sick person;
after changing the beds of a baby or cleaning a child who has gone to toilets;
after being moved or pushed/extended;
after touching an animal, animal food or animal waste;
Medical hand hygiene refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking medicines or providing medical care may prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogen agents (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
This practice is particularly important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; and reducing respiratory infections;
and the reduction of child mortality rates at home.
According to a study carried out in 2013, improving manual hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diary diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes such as washing hands in soap.
This simple practice may reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by almost 50%.
The establishment of actions to promote the washing of hands could reduce approximately one third of the diarrhoea episodes, a figure comparable to that obtained by providing drinking water to low-income regions.
Washing your hands in the soap allows you to reduce 48% of diarrhea and is the most effective and cost-effective means of preventing diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (IRA). It is an act that must be done automatically in the homes, schools and communities of the world.
The pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, which is about 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia results in the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, taking the habit of washing your hands with soap before eating and after going to toilets can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reducing almost half the deaths from diarrhoea and one fourth of the deaths due to acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is generally associated with other health measures under water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
The washing of hands also protects the impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Less delegated effect, the washing often with hands can soften the skin by causing skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive washing of hands could lead to eczema or dermatitis at the level of hands, characterized by skeletal skin and dementia, and particularly common among health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of the Compulsive Obession Disorder (TOC).
It is important to wash your hands in the soap at five key moments of the day in order to reduce the oral transmission of the disease: before and after using toilets (mixing, defecation), after cleaning a baby’s feet (or changing its beds), before feeding a child, before eating and before preparing food or handling of meat, fish or poultry.
It is also necessary to wash your hands properly in order to prevent the transmission of diseases, including before and after taking care of an injury or injury, after having been healed, pushed or moved, after touching animal waste or manipulating animals and after touching orders.
In many countries, washing hands in soap is low.
According to a study conducted in 2015 in 54 countries and with average household hygiene, 38.7% of households washed their hands with soap. A study conducted in 2014 showed that in Saudi Arabia the rate was higher (97%), the United States was in the middle of a table (77%) and China showed the lowest rate (23%). There are now several methods to improve behaviour and democratise the use of soap for washing hands at key times of the day. In particular, in developing countries, it is possible to propose to schoolchildren to wash their hands in groups at specific times in order to take them out of the day.
For example, the Ministry of Education of the Philippines has implemented a "Principal Health Care Programme" to promote children's health and education.
Disparasitation twice a year, associated with daily washing hands in soap and brushing teeth with a fluorinated toothbrush, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been implemented successfully in Indonesia.
In order to better eliminate the microorganisms present on the skin, it is necessary to add soap or water detectors.
The main action of knowledge and intelligence is to reduce obstacles to the solution and increase solvency.
Water alone is not an effective cleaning for the skin given that lipids and proteins, which are organic matter of the soil, are difficult to solve in water.
However, adequate water flow facilitates cleanup.
The solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can recover bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because bacteria are mixed with the mouse.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also indicates that "the automatic distributors of liquid soap are preferable".
Antibacterial knowledge has been strongly recommended to those concerned with their health status.
Today, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of antibiotics or recommended disinfectants allows for the target of antibiotics.
However, antibacterial knowledge contains current antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which many organisms are resistant to.
Consequently, although antibiotics resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial strains, the latter could not be as effective as was announced.
In addition to the tensive and skin-protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) that are used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, with antimicrobial function, and other protection agents (aque vera, vitamins, mendol, plant extracts).A strict analysis of the University of Oregon's public health school indicated that ordinary knowledge was as effective as antibacterial knowledge for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from their hands.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, cold and salty water is more effective than cold and salty water to remove natural oils carrying salts and bacteria.
In contrast to popular belief, however, scientific studies have revealed that the use of teeted water did not contribute to reducing the microbial load on hands.
A disinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century, non-alcohol-based hygiene products (called hydroalcoholic solutions, antiseptic solutions for hands or hand disinfectants) began to popularize.
Most of these are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with an excessive agent such as carbide (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or to a softener such as glycerin in order to obtain a liquid or muscle for greater ease of use and reduce the alcohol-association effect.
The addition of diluent hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERW), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, Rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as champagne.
Hydroalcoolitic solutions containing 70% of alcohol eliminate 99.97% (a reduction of 3.5, a log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of the bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.99% (a reduction of 4 to 5 log) of the bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application.The disinfectants for the hands are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydroalcoolitic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus-type viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of infectious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to treat or cover both hands well.
It should be faced with the rain and the second of both hands as well as between the fingertips and the needles for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, the mouse or the ice is dry.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands rather than using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when hands are visible.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of micro-organisms; however, they must not replace adequate hand washing unless you have water and soap in your hands.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions can lead to skin drying if the formula is not strengthened by emulsifiers and/or skin hydrating agents.
The alcohol-associating effect may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emulsifiers to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emulsants resulted in much less irritation and dryness of skin than antimicrobial soaps or detectors.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions tend to cause irritant contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than washing hands in water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-alcoholic products do not remove the organic material present on their hands, but do nothing but disinfect them.
That is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to avoid the spread of many pathogen agents, since they remain on their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcohol-free disinfectants depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than alcohol-based and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulas using Benzalkonium chloride have presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, to the difference in alcohol, which has been achieved after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse reactions.
Among the low-income populations, many are those who do not have the means to buy soap, and who use instead of ashes or land.
The earth or the earth can be more efficient than the water alone, but less than the sand.
What is more, if soil or ashes are contaminated by microorganisms, it is likely to increase the spread of disease instead of freezing.
In addition to soap, the centrifuge is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends that the semen or semen be used as an alternative to the semen when it is not available.
The United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the following steps be carefully addressed to prevent the transmission of diseases:
Wash your hands with running water cold or cold.
The current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the temperature of the water does not seem to vary).
To move a generous amount of soap on your hands by pushing them against each other, without forgetting the two hands, between the fingertips and under the corners.
The soap removes skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when they use soap than with water alone.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The action of frying creates friction, which helps to remove the germs of the skin, and further frying takes more germs.
Reincinding enough to current water.
Resurgence in a steaming water pool can lead to recontamination of the hands.
Check with a clean servant or free air.
Washing hands and wet hands are easier to retrace.The most often forgotten areas are the neck, neck, fingertips, and lower corners.
Artificial angles and the vernishing angles may be able to hibernate microorganisms.
hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin drying promotes the appearance of skin lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic options to wash hands when the water of the mine and/or the soap is not available.For example, to use water from a suspended well or from dry and dry soil and/or to burn it if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in rural schools or areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "type-steps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a stopper with a cord, and a pedal allowing a small amount of water to pour on your hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the process of hand hygiene, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to discuss it.
More and more research suggests that paper services are much more hygienic than electrical dryers that are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the extractive paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by Westminster University (London), to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper servicers, hot air dryers and more modern air dryers.
After drying and drying hands in hot air, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by 194 per cent on the lung and 254 per cent on the lungs.
The drying of dry hands to dry air resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the lung of 42% and on the lungs of 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper service, the total number of bacteria was reduced by 76 per cent on the gum pulp and up to 77 per cent on the trees.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the environment of toilets based on each drying method.
The dry-hand jet, which breathes out of the air at speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of excavating the micro-organisms of the hands and the apparatus and possibly contamination by other users of the toilets and the environment of the toilets in a perimeter up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot-hand dryer allows the distribution of micro-organisms at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the dry-hand.
Paper services revealed that there was no significant proliferation of micro-organisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product & Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following variations of bacterial numbering were observed:
There are many different dry hands manufacturers, and dry hands have been compared to drying with paper service.
Washing hands with disinfectants is an alternative solution during movements, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions should contain at least 60% of alcohol.
The washing of hands in the medical environment became mandatory after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent hospital diseases.
There are electronic devices that send reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study revealed that their use resulted in a reduction in infection rates.
The medical wash of hands must last for at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap and water or ice to soften and freeze each part of the hands.
The hands must be broken against each other by passing between the fingers.
In the case of residues under the angles, it is possible to use a dust brush to remove them.
Since germs present in the water are capable of staying on their hands, it is important to get well together and follow along with a clean servant.
After drying, paper service must be used to close the robinnet (and open the exit door if possible).
This helps to avoid reassessing your hands in contact with the surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in health structures is to remove pathogenic micro-organisms ("gremes") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical institutions, a large number of doctors and nurses who regularly forget to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, washing hands properly and following other simple procedures may reduce the rate of blood infections associated with catheters by 66%. The World Health Organization published a brochure describing the standard procedure to be followed to wash and wash hands in health.
The draft manual on the health of the hands established by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to collect comments from the Internet.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby and al.
Devices available in trade may measure and certify the hygiene of hands if compliance with regulation is observed.
The World Health Organization defines "Five indications" concerning the hygiene of hands:
after exposure to blood/to biological liquid;
before an aseptic treatment; and
After contact with the patient, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (i.e. "medicines" or "antimicrobials") seeks to the hands washing agent an action to destroy germs.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing surgery or in environments where antibiotics are very complex. To "frott" the hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a robot that can be opened and closed without touching the hands, a product of chlorhexidine or iodine-based washing, sterile services to dry the hands after washing them, a sterile brush to flush them and another sterile instrument to clean them under the needles.
All old people must be removed.
In this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and front arms up to the neck, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't need to shake your hands for 10 minutes.
During breast-feeding, it must be avoided that the water on the front arms does not fall to the hands.
Once your hands are washed, you need to dry your hands using a sterile tongue and fill a surgical cassette.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were achieved in the first 20 per cent of washing and that there was only very few additional benefits to increase the washing rate of hands by more than 35 per cent.
If you compare the washing of your hands with an ordinary wash with that performed with an antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to your food is more than three times higher. Also, by comparing the washing of your hands with an alcohol-based solution and washing your hands with an antibacterial soap for an average period of 30 seconds per second, it is observed that the first decreases bacterial contamination by 26% per second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce influenza A (H1N1) virus (H1N1) and the traces of Clostridium difficult to handle. In order to improve the hygiene of hands in health care facilities, it is possible to train staff to wash their hands, put more alcohol-based products at their disposal and address written and verbal reminders on this subject.
More extensive research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
In developing countries, washing hands in soap is considered a small and essential tool for maintaining health, which is intended to feed properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities to wash hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to establish universal hygiene habits.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find robins to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite economic options to build wash stations.
However, the low washing rate of hands can also be imputable to tight habits, rather than to lack of soap or water.
The promotion of soap washing and awareness-raising activities in this regard can influence political decisions, make known the benefits associated with this practice and bring about a long-term change in behaviour among the population.
In order to achieve this goal, monitoring and evaluation activities are needed.
A systematic review of 70 studies revealed that local approaches are effective to increase the rate of hand washing in low and medium-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. As regards the promotion of hand washing in schools, the example of the UNICEF " Three Star Approach " can be cited, which encourages schools to take simple and cost-effective measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can pass from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in manual hygiene campaigns that are carried out to reduce child diseases and mortality.
The World Hand Washing Day is another example of the awareness campaign that seeks to promote the development of behaviors. Following the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji to illustrate the washing of hands.
Several studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness report of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the number of years of healthy life (i.e. avoided DALY).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap washing hands is much more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of washing hands for human health, especially for people in situations of vulnerability such as mothers coming to the hospital or wounded soldiers, was first identified by two medical pioneers of the 19th century: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of Modern Nurses" in the British.
At the time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetid ulcers called miasma.
In the 1980s, food-borne infections and non-economic infections led the American Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to promote more actively the hygiene of hands as an essential means to prevent the spread of infections.
The appearance of porcine influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to a greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash their hands with soap to prevent these infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, exhibitions depicting "good hand washing techniques" were placed on the side of the doors in public toilets and in office buildings and airports.
The expression "if you wash your hands" refers to the refusal of a person to assume responsibility or to be complex about something.
It is derived from a Bible verse by Matthew in which Ponce Pilate washes his hands of the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Macbeth, Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands emotionally to try to clean up an imaginary bag, symbolizes her bad conscience about the crimes she committed and that she moved her husband to commit.
It has also been observed that some people, after having been accustomed to committing acts contrary to ethics or having thought of doing so, tend to wash their hands more often than others and give more value to washing their hands.
In addition, those who are authorized to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less inclined to give themselves to other “cleaning” compensatory measures such as the volunteer.
Some religions prescribe the washing of hands for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, which consists of using water and not soap to wash their hands, is part of the washing rituals of hands put forward in many religions, including Bahaiism and Hinduism, the immersion (tevilah) and the ritual washing of hands (Nétilat Yadayim) in Judaism, the washing of hands in Christianity and the Wudhu in Islam. The religions also prescribe washing of hands for hygiene purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash their hands after going to toilets.
Likewise, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing their hands before and after each meal.
COVID-19 Risk Controls at Work
The COVID-19 risk controls on the workplace identify the implementation of health and safety methodologies at work for the control of risks for the prevention of coronary disease in 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls vary according to the workplace and tasks, based on an assessment of the risks of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community and the individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Employment Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the lowest exposure risk employment has a minimum professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic anti-infection prevention measures are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory label and maintenance of a clean and routine job.
Medium exposure risk employment includes those who need frequent or close contacts with persons without suspected or known COVID-19 but who may be infected by a current Community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the public, including in schools, high-density working environments and some high-volume detailed environments.
Risk controls in this group, as well as basic anti-infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly efficient air filters, hygiene wires and the provision of individual protection equipment in case of encountering an infected person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with suspected or known COVID-19 as presenting a high risk of exposure, at a very high risk if they conduct procedures producing aerosols or sampling or manipulation of samples of persons with a suspected or known COVID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protection equipment adapted to the task.
The COVID-19 epidemics may have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they are sick, have to take care of other people or fear possible exposure.
Business models can change, both with regard to the requested goods and the means to acquire them (i.e. to take their courses out of time or use delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of articles from regions severely affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. A plan for preparing and responding to infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protection measures.
Plans take into account the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors related to the family and community context and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also seek the necessary controls to deal with these risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise following the epidemics.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of response to an epidemic include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining trade operations and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chain.
The seriousness of the disease in the community in which the undertaking is located influences the responses applied.
The risk control hierarchy forms a global framework for health and safety at work in order to group risk controls effectively.
When risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, administrative controls and individual protection equipment.
Technical controls involve the isolation of workers at work risks without having to rely on the behaviour of workers, which can be the most economic solution to implement.
Administrative controls shall designate changes in employment policies or procedures which require action by the employer or employer.
The individual protection equipment (IPI) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help prevent certain exposures.
All types of IPIs must be selected according to the risk for the worker, correctly adapted according to the needs (e.g. breathing masks), properly and systematically ported, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced by the requirements, and correctly withdrawn, cleaned and stored or returned to avoid any contamination.
According to the U.S. Employment Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the lowest exposure risk employment has a minimum professional contact with the public and other employees.
The basic measures for prevention of infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and minute washing of hands, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, breathing label, including covering their mouth and nose to touch and linger, providing muscles and lungs, preparation for television or working hours as needed, destabilizing workers to use the tools and equipment of others and maintenance of cleaning and decontamination of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected persons is a crucial step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others at work.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with symptoms of respiratory disease should stay at home until they have no fever, fever signs or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever or other symptoms; they also recommend applying flexible leave policies, allowing employees to stay at home to take care of a sick family member and to inform employees of these policies.
According to OIOS, average exposure risk employment includes those who need frequent or close contact, at least six feet (1.8 m) of persons without COVID-19 suspected or known, but may be infected by SARS-COV-2 due to a Community transmission running around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip in a region with a COVID-19 broadcast.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, including in schools, high-density working environments and some high-volume detailing environments. Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of high-efficiency and high-risk air filters, the increase in ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic windscreens and the installation of a driver's window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and those at higher risk include the encouragement of workers who stay at home, replacement of meetings by virtual communications and higher risk of high-efficiency, the installation of air-conditioning, the installation of air-conditioning barriers, the installation of the physical barriers to the surface, and the installation of the surfaces of the surfaces of the plastics in the plastics, and the installation of the windscreen window, the installation of a window for the maintenance window.
Workers in this risk group are rarely required to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls sick on a plane, appropriate controls for the protection of workers and other passengers include the following measures: to separate the disease from the other by 6 feet, to designate a crew member to deal with the disease and to offer a protection mask to the disease or to ask him to cover his mouth and nose with the help of pigs when he falls or falls.
The cabin crew shall carry capable medical gloves when it is occupied by a sick passenger or affected by organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional individual protection equipment if the sick passenger is present with fever, persistent or respiratory difficulties.
Gloves and other essential items must be taken into a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include the report of the journey in case of disease, as well as the self-insulated and immediate information of the medical centre if it develops a fever or other symptoms once on board.
Ideally, medical monitoring must take place in the home of the isolated person. For school facilities and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection purposes if an infected person has entered a school building, regardless of community propaganda.
In the case of moderate minimum Community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling educational outputs, assemblies and other important collections such as physical education courses or choirs or canteen meals, increasing room between offices, increasing arrival and exit hours, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate nurse for children with flu symptoms.
In case of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, an extension of school holidays can be considered. For the forces of the order carrying out routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low by the CDC.
The officers of the order forces who must contact persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as the ambulances, including the port of appropriate individual protection equipment.
In the event of close contact during an arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt before re-use using a lens or spray triggers home and follow the standard restraint and implementation procedures of the IMPs used, as well as the binding and washing of clothing.
OHA considers some health workers and funeral workers to belong to high or very high exposure risk categories.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to suspected or known COVID-19 patients.
They become very high-risk workers if they conduct procedures producing aerosols or removals or manipulations of patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include incubation, all induction procedures, bronchoscopyes, certain dental examinations and procedures or invasive sampling.
The high-risk funerals include workers who are involved in the preparation of bodies with COVID-19 suspected or known at the time of their death; they are at a very high risk of exposure if they practice an autopsy. The additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with COVID-19 suspected or known, including during the execution of aerosol procedures.
A specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health and funeral environments.
Samples should be manipulated using level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients enter separate waiting rooms based on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other IPIs, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for persons working at least 6 feet of patients with suspected or known infection by SARS-COV-2 and for those performing aerosols-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 or higher respiratory masks approved by NISH must be used in the context of a full and written respiratory protection programme including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide higher protection and better comfort to the worker. The WHO does not recommend combinations, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic liquids.
The WHO recommends the port of a surgical mask only by inspection personnel at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples, carry or transport COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective cramps or facial screen, a blouse and gloves.
In the case of aerosol-producing procedure, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Given that the global supply of IPI is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for IPI through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a site occupied by a patient COVID-19 to persons directly involved in its care, the use of IPIs necessary for the specific task alone, the continued use of the same respiratory mask without withdrawing it for the treatment of several patients with the same diagnosis, the monitoring and coordination of the IPI supply chain and the dissuasation of the use of masks for symptomatic individuals.

We find this month in an exceptional situation.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and our responsibilities toward one another.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response rests on the type of empathy, cooperation and community-building at the global level that is at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and hospitality that we have observed among all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and instant conversations are a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings with whom we have the opportunity to work.
I could not be more grateful and proud of all of you among my colleagues.
Last week, someone gave me his gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at the present time, and the strong symbol is the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible by your work, which you keep operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the security of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but also how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play there, we are going to make appropriate adjustments in the way we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and our time
As Robyn mentioned above, the team met last night to discuss our approach and our use of time in the days and months to come.
During this discussion, we have considered what would be an appropriate response to the situation we face and the best way to ensure the organization's viability during this period.
First of all, we had to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take some rest, don't worry.
All staff members, subcontractors and contractors:
our daily work time target will be about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week, until the new order.
We will not declare holiday days: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at present, and if you need to take care of your neighbors, take courses or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should go without saying, but we say it.
No sickness arrest or leave payment required: simply prevent your superior and help your team review the timetables and time-uses to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positively in COVID-19, please prevent Bryan from the T&amp;C Ops department to help you with the T&amp;C and ensure that your situation receives the necessary attention from the management).
Time staff will be paid in full.
We have already announced it, and we will reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our subcontractors and fellow members of the time staff.
The world will be rewarded on the basis of its usual working hours under normal conditions.
This is important if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means of eliminating their stress in the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly grateful, especially during periods like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to communicate with your superior, so that we know what to expect and how to take the necessary measures.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
The SRE, Ops RH, Trust &amp; and Fund Collection teams (including others) perform essential work that may need to be strengthened.
We will start a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us to focus on the most essential projects.
Slow down now won't be too late.
We do not intend to "work twice more to save time" when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to make extra hours to respect dates now unrealistic.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will strive to set new goals and opportunities where possible.
What about the APP (Annual Planning) ?
In order to adapt us to our new reality and to the objectives of working time daily, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our aim is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan which requires more time to set up a budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, to take care of themselves and their neighbors while adapting to those who need or want to see their work time reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of opportunities significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will inform the delegates and the team of the next steps of confirmation.
Thank the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco could have been exposed to COVID-19 virus.
However, in excess of caution, we called on an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all areas of San Francisco's office.
They used a hospital quality antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator boxes leading to our station.
The building has used its own protocol of duty which uses products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork site, which has shared with us and the entire staff members based in Washington DC its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a completely remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco's recommendations.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continued but could be updated.
Some of our colleagues are working away for the first time.
Our colleagues who used to work away from work realize that adaptation can be difficult and would like to offer you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings at meetings for a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer meetings are necessary, consider distributing them for several days.
Define the meeting clearly, have a agenda and send documentation in advance.
Make videos the standard, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage online collaboration and exchange.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or take collective notes).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need a comfortable case.
Use your well-being refund for the collages.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The RH Operation Team studies ergonomic guidelines based on webinars to support the increase in the distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the Community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimédia, such as the edition-a-thons, until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understood that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible for their agreed grant activities to be carried out and that no person would be punished if they were delayed or modified.
The next week, we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be at the same time in the face of confusion and relief in the face of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimédia and others.
For this reason, the CRT is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communication with them.
Keep in touch despite problems related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for an extraordinary meeting of the next Thursday staff, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this time to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
From here, you can always find the information contained in this email, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and gather all information at the same location.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have questions about movements, events, an important workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help in any other way, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the CRT.
We are here to support and secure the link if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive matter, please send an e-mail to Bryan Juden, Director of International Global Operations RH.
None of these changes should be considered as a waste of our work and our obligations.
On the contrary, it is a matter of recognizing that our work and our obligations will probably have to be adapted in an unprecedented way at present.
These are the steps we consider necessary to support each other and to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help it needs, and to provide the service that everyone can count on.
Our planned work will be there to wait for the time to come.
For now, it is time to arrive and prepare for the important work that will take place in the weeks and perhaps months to come.
We need each of you to get there, which is why you need to preserve and take care of your families so that you can give the best of yourself at the moment.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
with Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) is an external-face-related enzyme (cell membranes) of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestinal cells.
ACE2 contraindicates the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and by increasing Ang (1-7) which makes it a promising medical target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the entry point in certain coronavirus cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often designated as HACE2.
Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a metalluenzyme containing zinc located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-threshold M2 field of peptidase and a C-threshold mineral acid transporter.
ACE2 is a single-step membrane of type I, whose active area on the enzyme level is exposed to the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
ACE2's extracellular domain is affected by a transmembranic area by another enzyme called Sheddase; the solvent protein that results is released into the blood stream and finally extracted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is related to the primary cell membrane of type II pulmonary alveoli cells, intestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and blood cells of most organs.
The expression of ANC2 is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and the cerebral throne.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to compensate the ACE.
The ACE acts as angiotensin I hormone in angiotensin II vasoconstrictr.
The ACE2 is composed of phenylamine amino acid at the end of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also cut several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and graine.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the amino acid carrier neutral SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As transmembranal protein, ACE2 is the primary entry point in certain coronavirus cells, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus originating in SRAS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus originating in COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of S1 of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 in the enzymatic area of ACE2 to the surface of cells results in endocytosis and both virus and enzyme transfer in endosomes within cells.
This process of entry also requires the start of protein S by serum host protein TMPRSS2, which is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that reducing ACE2 rates in cells can help fight infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies have recommended that standard treatment be continued with the assistance of the ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic review and metaanalysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that "the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia in relation to witness subjects."
In addition, "pneumonium risk has also been reduced in patients treated by an ACE inhibitor who had a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular AVC victims and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less profound than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Angiotensin 2 recombinant human enzyme (rhACE2) is present as an innovative treatment for severe pulmonary lesions and seems to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in the porcelains affected by acute respiratory depression caused by lipolysaccharide.
The half-life of RhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes more than 24 hours.
Several conclusions suggested that RhACE2 could be a promising medicine for individuals who are intolerant to classical inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (SRA) or for patients with high circulation of angiotensin II. RhACE2 under infusion was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the traceability of contacts in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of persons ('contacts') who may be in contact with an infected person.
Several applications have been developed or proposed, with official support from the Government in certain territories and in certain jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracking applications.
These systems, in particular those that are responsible for tracking the geographical location of users of applications, raise issues of respect for private life.
There are other less intrusive options, including using Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity with other portable phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a functionality that enables them to take on Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese Government, in association with Ayaha, has launched an application in China that allows citizens to check whether they have been contacted by COVID-19 people.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has chosen for an application called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local information community, it has been provided with an open source and will be returned to the Government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!" a Bluetooth application that ensures the traceability of exposure to potentially infected persons and quickly communicates with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the application has been pending approval by Google Play Store and the App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking application was at an advanced development stage and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application was planned in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering setting up applications on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wishes to introduce a geoperation application for patients with COVID-19 and resident in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security at Cambridge University, mentioned several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positives and lack of potential effectiveness if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple only allows "official" or generally responsible bodies to add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Soldiers in favour of the protection of private life were concerned about the implications of coronavirus applications in terms of mass monitoring, in particular the possible demining of the monitoring infrastructure created to face the Coronavirus pandemic once the threat has been removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have published a statement calling for the limitation of such surveillance.
These organizations have provided for eight conditions to be met in the framework of government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the extension of control and surveillance should include exclusion clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating COVID-19;
the safety of data and anonymity should be demonstrated;
digital monitoring should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization is avoided;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the Act;
protection against abuses and remedies should be provided for citizens in cases of abuse;
The "significant participation" of all "participating parties concerned" would be mandatory, including those of public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany also published verification lists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple is aimed at addressing the problem of the persistence of monitoring by deleting the tracking mechanism of the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, which at the same time eliminates the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network solutions with access to gross geolocation data present major potential issues in respect of private life.
However, not all systems based on central servers do not need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for communication, which enables private life to be respected (see section below).
In South Korea, a system not based on an application was used for tracking contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected trace information from different sources, including data on tracking mobile devices and card transactions, which they then associated with in order to send SMS warnings to potential infected persons.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the Government has also made publicly available location information, which was authorized following the profound changes to the Privacy Protection Act following the impact of the MERS epidemic on the country.
This information is available to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralised systems that preserve privacy.
The details have not yet been communicated on 6 April 2020.
The trace of contacts with privacy is a well-established concept, which is a large volume of research data since 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts worked on solutions to privacy, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user's proximity with other portable phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that is associated with centralised and decentralised approaches and does not constitute a single protocol. Decentralised protocols include Decentralised Privacy- Preserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN), previously called Contact Event Numbers, CEN, Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT), among others.
These protocols will ensure that identifiable personal data will never leave the device and that all the corresponding devices are on the device.
The Private Group of MIT Media Lab is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy conservation techniques in the collection and use of location or contact data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies initially based on MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure material technologies to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the TNC International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and protocols that are essentially equivalent, with a view to reducing fragmentation and ensuring the global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, an essential factor in their adoption by a wide public.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace Protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, who control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, stating that it would preserve private life and associate Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption with confidentiality.
They also published the specifications of basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to enable Governments to create official life-saving applications for coronavirus
Direct integration of this functionality in iOS and Android. Google and Apple are planning to address the problems of the adoption of the solution and the sustainability of monitoring by initially distributing the system by updating the operating system and by removing it later in the same way once the threat is removed.
The repositioning of a medicine (also called reorientation, reproducination, re-infection or change of therapeutic indication of a medicine) refers to the conversion of an approved medicine to a disease or to a different medical condition for which it was originally developed.
This is a currently studied scientific research tool to develop safe and effective treatment against COVID-19.
Other research activities include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and plasma transfusions of convalescent people. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each containing several link sites.
The analysis of these link sites offers the realistic development project of effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are Papaine-type proteases, ANN polymerase dependent ARN, Helica, S protein and ADP phosphatase.
Hussein A A, and al. studied several composed candidates who then optimized and analysed to determine their structural similarity with the most approved medicines to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is also an antipaluden medicine used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that the corresponding chloroquine and hydroxyroquine would be part of the four medicines studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York’s Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State tests on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine under an emergency authorisation (USA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is only authorised under the U.S. as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dose or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors have indicated that this medicine is "when there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in association with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
More extensive studies are being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School carries out a test on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
In Chinese clinical trials conducted in Wuhan and Shenzhen, favipinavir was “clearly effective”.
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative for an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipinavir and half of the other half received imifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has reminded the public that the evidence available in favour of the medicinal product is minor and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy medicine in Japan for its reservations and that it would use the army to deliver the medicine to university hospitals where it would be used to care for COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up opportunities for Trup administration to obtain the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in serious cases of disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those who are trying to procrastinate.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an association of antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
These medicines have been designed to prevent the replication of HIV in connection with protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify these medicines to find a component related to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for HIV/AIDS-specific drug recovery.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences such as Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gale Sciences then discovered that remdesivir had an in vitro antiviral activity against several filviruses, pneumovirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
An antiviral treatment problem is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious disease and transmission.
Some pre-tested studies suggest that reddesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, among which two were conducted by Cleveland University hospitals; one is responsible for people suffering from moderate pathology and the other on those most severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with CVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China and Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The state of New York started the azithromycin antibiotics tests on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) provides a clinical trial on Teijin’s alvesco (cyclosonide), a corticosteroid for asthma inhalation, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new Coronavirus.
An angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme test is ongoing with 200 patients to recruit from severe cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.

The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults over 40 years of age and over who have been diagnosed with positive COVID-19 and present moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women pregnant or breast-feeding or who do not have an effective method of contraception are not allowed.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
The low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which is an incentive for the Italian drug agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study of 300 patients and the use of sodium enoxaparin at preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Given that SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers focused on the repositioning of approved antiviral medicines that have been developed for previous infections such as MERS, SRAS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Directives
Umifenovir: umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Directives
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially resistant as COVID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Tests are also underway in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed the clinical tests, many development attempts are underway.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, virus of the origin of the disease, at least 18 months ago.
In April, five vaccine candidates were under phase I safety study.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic took place around the world in 2020, leading to significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As defined in April, the imperatives of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, ECPI scientists indicated that 10 different technological platforms held research and development projects beginning in 2020 to create an effective vaccine against CVID-19.
The objectives of the main platform in phase I safety studies include:
Nuclear acid (ADN and ARN) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenoviral vector type 5)
As the ECI scientists stated in April, 115 vaccine candidates in total are at the first stages of development of 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) confirmed as assets and 37 other announced, but with little public information available (summarily planned or design).
A phase I-II test results in preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually randomized, controlled against placebo and carried out in several centres, with more precise doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a group of witnesses, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring the adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active development vaccines (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human person assessment phase (pre-clinical research).
About 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular pen vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.

The vaccine candidate is researching in the laboratory, the human test is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, Guardian announced that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "strong amounts of money to benefit from exclusive access to the vaccine against COVID-19", which led to the Government's protest.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for joint development of an ARNm vaccine.
The application for vaccine based on ARNm BNT162 is currently in preclinical phase with the start of the clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the human test of its final vaccine candidate could begin in autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Institute of Pastor, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a research group for a vaccine against COVID-19 including the Institute of Pastor, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the CEPI in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to US$29 million.
The other ECPI investment partners for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started testing on the animals of six different vaccines.
Researchers at the Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-amplifier ARN vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine application was developed within 14 days following the dispatch of the sequence by China.
At the end of March, the Government of Canada announced the allocation of $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
At the same time, the Government of Canada has announced the allocation of $192 million for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 with national “vaccin bank” projects containing several new vaccines that can be used if other cancer epidemics occur.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School indicated that PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in rats, stated that “the sub-units of SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines administered by microguillas triggered an important response to the specific antibodies of the antigen [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization”.
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo pharmacovigilance School announced the design of a vaccine candidate based on DNA in the potential form of a nasal spray.
With bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to reproduce in human bacteria to produce non-violent particles similar to viruses that could stimulate the production of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled their resources for access to IBM supercomputers, associated with computer resources based on Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can provide benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another trial conducted in Australia involves 4,170 health professionals.
Development vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using animal models specific to COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 rats, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates the need to implement level 3 biosafety control measures for the handling of live viruses and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SRAS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protection vaccine against SRAS that has demonstrated both its safety and its effectiveness in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SRAS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.
When MERS recovered, it was thought that existing research on SRAS could serve as a model for the development of vaccines and medicines against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, one vaccine against MERS (based on DNA) had completed phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were in progress; all vaccines were viral vectors, two adénoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks have spread a theory of the conspiracy that the virus was known from COVID-19 and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social networks publications refer to existing patents bearing genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as SRAS coronavirus.
Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Current symptoms include fever, all of them and swelling.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and appearance of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can be oscillated between two and fourteen days.
While most cases lead to moderate symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and a failure of several organs.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread through close contact, often by tastes produced by touching, touching or talking.
These tastelets are produced at breathing, usually fall on the ground or on surfaces rather than represent an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and by touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days following the occurrence of symptoms, although the infection is possible before the symptoms and during subsequent stages of the disease. The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who feel infected by the virus and their caregivers.
The recommendations on the port of the mask by the public in general vary, some authorities recommend their use, others recommend their use, and others impose their use.
There is currently no specific antiviral vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.
The local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of the six WHO regions.
People infected by the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, swelling.
The symptoms of urgency include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent thoracic pressure, confusion, difficulty in walking and face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advised to consult a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, higher respiratory symptoms such as erythema, nasal discharge or throat disease may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in different proportions.
Some cases in China have initially presented only a thoracic pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can cause pneumonia, the failure of several organs and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period usually lasts from five to six days, but it can last up to 14 days.
97.5 per cent of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection, reports indicate that not all infected persons will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, but preliminary elements suggested that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of non-symptomatic people is currently unknown in the study, and the Korean disease prevention and control centres (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections found today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Exploration and relief can both carry important viral loads.
The fact that you speak more freely than the fact that you normally speak.
A study in Singapore revealed that anyone without protection can design jewellery at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not transported by air, the National Sciences Academy suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors in color outside the patient's rooms produced positive samples to the viral ARN.
Some medical procedures such as incubation and cardiopulmonary reanimation (RCP) may dispersal respiratory secrets and therefore lead to air-producing.
Although there are concerns about the spread by cells, this risk is understood as low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although propaganda may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if we don't know exactly what the disease is going on with, one person in general is infected with two to three others.
In particular, the virus could be detected at the end of one day on the carton, three days on the plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and at the end of four hours on the cover at 99%.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Swallows and detectors are also effective if used properly; soap-based products decrease the protective lipid layer of the virus, which disables and eliminates skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, salt samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new neurovirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three persons with pneumonia related to Wuhan's acute respiratory disease.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the coronaviruses that appear in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close parent of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2), which is the most common in lung type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spicele" (peplummer) to connect to ACE 2 and penetrate into the host cell.
Acute cardiac injuries have been reported in 12 per cent of those admitted to Wuhan hospital in China, and are more frequent when the disease is more severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammation response and immune system problems during disease progression, but myocardial infarction may also be associated with ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and heart functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) has been observed in patients with intensive care who are infected with CVID-19 and can be associated with a negative forecast.
Although SARS-COV-2 presents a tropical to epithelial cells of respiratory tract that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 experience systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
These are in particular the secret T cells of GM-CSF that have been associated with the recruitment of inflamatory monocytes secreting IL6 and severe pulmonary pathology in patients with CVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported in autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test is generally carried out on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngal removal; however, a nasal removal or inspection may also be used.
Overall, results are available within a few hours, up to two days.
Blood tests may also be used, but they require two blood tests taken two weeks of interval and the results are of low immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a coronavirus strain and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have developed independently of the chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect infection by the virus.
On 4 April 2020, anti-body tests (probably detectable of active infections and prior infection of a person) were under development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experience of the test revealed a accuracy of only 60 to 70 per cent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first patient's nearest test on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical and epidemiological characteristics.
Multi-laborary bilateral depletion opportunities with peripheral, asymmetric and lateral distribution are typical symptoms visible at the start of the infection.
Plumulal Dominance, crazi paving (interlogular septal failure with variable alveolar complication) and consolidation may occur with the progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and on COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main findings of autopsy pathological findings are:
Macroscopy: lung disease, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia may be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hyperplasia, extended atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and multinucleated genetic cells
severe pneumonia: diffusion alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory depression (SDRA) and severe hypoglycaemia.
healing pneumonium: organization of exudes in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminating intravascular coagulation (CIVD); leuco-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding tight places, frequently washing hands in water and soap for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a muscle when it is hit or swallowed and using the inside of the neck in the absence of muscle.
A correct hand hygiene after touching or swallowing is recommended.
The CDC recommended covering the face with the help of a tissue in public places in order to limit transmission in case of symptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce contact between people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing movement and canceling important groups of people.
The distance directives also include respect for a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between persons.
There is no known medicine to be effective in the prevention of COVID-19. Since a vaccine has not been expected before 2021 as soon as possible, a key element of COVID-19 management is to try to reduce the epidemical peak, which is also called "spare the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often in soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after they have been in toilets or when their hands are visiblely salted; before they eat; and after they have moved, pushed, or ever.
It also recommends using a disinfectant solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% of alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where trade hands disinfectants are not available, WHO offers two forms for local production.
In these forms, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
The hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial traces in alcohol, which is not "an active antiseptic substance for hands".
Glycerol is added as moisture.
People are treated with support care that may include hydrotherapy, oxygen therapy and support from other affected living organs.
The CDC recommends that persons suspected of carrying the virus bear a simple facial mask.
The extracorporal oxygenation by membrane (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still analysed.
Personal hygiene, a way of life and healthy nutrition have been recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those who have moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized for COVID-19.
Reanimative and pneumologists in the United States have collected therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment of COVID-19.
With regard to symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetamineopene) instead of ibuprofen in the first line.
Cautions should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, particularly in conditions of care where procedures may generate aerosols such as inhalation or manual ventilation.
For health professionals who are suffering from COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an insulation room suitable for air infection (AIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and air-transmission precautions. The CDC highlights guidelines on the use of individual protection equipment (IPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blues, respiratory or facial masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respiratory masks (for facial masks) are privileged.
The N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA authorised the use of these masks under an emergency authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unindicated uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection screens, or in recent use, artificial masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory assistance for persons suffering from respiratory failure associated with CVID-19 is actively studied for people hospitalized. Some evidence indicates that incubation can be avoided using a high-density nasal channel or positive pressure of double-level respiratory pathways.
It is ignored whether one or both generate the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to have invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the distribution of aerosol particles in relation to high-density nasal channels. Serious cases are more common in older adults (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the capacity of the care system to treat a small Sudanese number of COVID-19 cases sufficiently severe to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5 per cent of cases were admitted in intensive care, 2.3 per cent needed respiratory assistance and 1.4 per cent were killed.
In China, approximately 30 per cent of the people who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
The mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) during CVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices that offer high pressure control modes and high PEPs are necessary to optimise the release of oxygen and minimize the risk of pulmonary injury associated with ventilation and pneumothhorax.
The high PEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments to be started in January 2020 and several antiviral medicines are the subject of clinical trials.
The redicivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new medicines may not be developed before 2021, several test drugs are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral medicine may be tried in people with severe disease.
The WHO recommended that volunteers participate in trials on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorisation to plasma of convalescent persons as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been submitted to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and effectiveness for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect "close contacts" using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend auto-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. The analysis of mass data from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phones location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected persons and persons with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate mobile phone data for persons suspected of having coronary virus.
The measure was designed to respect quarantine and to protect persons who might have been contacted by infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also shared aggregated telephone location data with the German federal government agency Robert Koch in order to analyse and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect the quarantine.
In Italy, regional health minister Giulia Gallera has been informed by mobile phone operators that "40 per cent of people continue to move".
The German Government held a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid launched an appeal at the world level to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, movement restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying that "insulting social isolation, solitude, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail for mental health and well-being".
The disease may have a moderate evolution with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as rhummy.
Measuring cases usually recur in two weeks, while serious or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Injecting women may pose a higher risk of serious infection to COVID-19 according to data from similar viruses, such as SRAS and MERS, but there is no data for COVID-19. In some cases COVID-19 may affect lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress towards acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-visceral failure.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include septaemia, problems with coagulation and cardiac, renal and hepatic injury.
Coagulation disorders, in particular increased prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of cases treated with CVID-19, with renal failure observed in 4% of the population.
About 20 to 30 per cent of COVID-19 infected persons have a high rate of hepatic enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the beginning of symptoms and death was ten days, including five hospitalizations.
However, patients with intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the mean duration between the beginning of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total of between six and 41 days.
In a study of the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem pulmonary samples present a spread alveoliary damage with fibromyxoid cell exudations in both lungs.
Viral cytopathy changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The picture of the lungs is like a acute respiratory depression syndrome (SDRA).
At 11.8 per cent of the deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart attacks due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest have been observed.
According to the United States in March data, 89 per cent of hospitalized persons had preexisting pathologies, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region could also have an impact on mortality.
The estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary because of these regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
The undercalculating of moderate cases can lead to a review of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previous contracts may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more prone to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and have a 2.4 times higher risk of intensive care or death in relation to non-smokers. Concerns are also seen in relation to long-term diseases.
The hospital administration of Hong Kong observed a fall of 20% to 30% in respiratory capacity in certain disease healers, and pulmonary scanners suggest organic lesions.
This can also lead to an acute post-treatment syndrome.
In March 2020, it was ignored whether an earlier infection had an effective long-term immunity in people who were cured of the disease.
Immunities are considered likely to be based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of COVID-19 treated people have been reported following positive tests for coronavirus at a later date.
These cases are considered to be an aggravation of a latent infection rather than a re-infection.
It is thought that the virus is natural and animal origin, by spreading infection.
The real origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely by human transmission.
One of the 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January 2020 revealed that the oldest date of occurrence of symptoms occurred on 1 December 2019.
Official publications of the WHO indicated the first appearance of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary according to the regions and in time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time elapsed since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO has affected the emergency pathological codes CIM-10 U07.1 for confirmed deaths in the SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for COVID-19 cases diagnosed with clinical or epidemiological reasons without infection in the SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in the laboratory. The death/cas report reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed at a given time interval.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the worldwide death/cass report is 6.9% (153 8222/2 240 191) until 17 April 2020.
This number varies from region to region. Other measures include the rate of fatality (CFR) which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed who are infected with the disease and the rate of fatality (IRF) that reflects the percentage of persons who are infected (diagnosed or not) who are affected by a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected persons develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) are already dead.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and for young people, will generate a relatively low mortality rate, and all deaths associated with COVID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been discussed.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of people may have antibodies, according to a blood donors assessment.
69 deaths (0,004 per cent of the population) were confirmed as related to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the rate of mortality vary between man and woman.
Death is higher in humans in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk is among 50-year-old men, the difference between men and women who are only 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent in men and 1.7 per cent in women.
The specific reasons for this difference between sex are unknown, but genetics and behavioral factors may be involved.
Immunological differences in gender, the lower prevalence of smoking in women and the development of comorbidities in men such as hypertension at an advanced age than in women could have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of infected individuals were men and 72 per cent of CVID-19 people were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. Government does not collect the data associated with COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SRAS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health personnel, particularly nursing staff, are women and pose an increased risk of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
The Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explained that CO means crown, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), to an animal species or group of persons, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus caused by COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus responsible" in its public communication.
The disease and the virus are both commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial epidemic in Wuhan, in China, the virus and disease were often referred to as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of provisional disease names 2019-nCov and respiratory disease as well as 2019-nCov for virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of places in the names of diseases and viruses.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Taking into account the capacity limits of standard supply channels, some digital manufacturers print care material such as screws and breathing parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respiratory valve and the supplier could not provide it at any time, a local startup returned and printed the 100 valves required at night.
Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19, complex theories, false information and disinformation emerged about the origin, scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and spread rapidly online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to some other animals.
Studies have not been able to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, canards and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is currently carried out by government organizations, university groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched "the SOLIDARITY trial" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral components presenting the most promising efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use both ACE 2 receptors to penetrate into human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are the subject of research.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause rapid immune response from the human body in the event of a new CVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit-based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these research focuses on spicule S protein that helps the virus to infiltrate the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of vaccines based on nuclear acids (adN or ARN vaccination, a new vaccine creation technique).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a code of genetic indefensively copied on the virus that causes the disease. The anti-body activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are ongoing.
Seven trials have evaluated already approved treatment against malaria, including four studies on hydroxycroquine or chloroquine.
Reversible antiviral drugs are the majority of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials on redisivir in several countries where reports are expected at the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of clinical development of vaccines and medicinal products against COVID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral medicinal products are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxyroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with beta interferon.
Provisional data suggest the effectiveness of remdesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with compatriotism.
Phase III clinical trials are ongoing in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, some require an independent analysis of research work.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, Wuhan’s virology institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that the double dose is extremely dangerous and could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorised the use of hydroxyroquin and chloroquine under an emergency authorisation for the use of CVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or imifenovir against CVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for the follow-up of an in vivo study following a low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial spicula protein starting with serum transmembranal protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE 2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin present major limits that prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without additional studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not play a known role in the treatment of CVID-19.
Cytokinic shock can be a complication at later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokinic antichoc properties. Tocilizumab was included in the guidelines for treatment by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
There is a phase 2 test that is not randomized at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe form of disease.
As associated with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokinetic shock, it must be opposed to developments that are suspected of causing the death of certain affected persons.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of refractory cytokines prolongation of steroids caused by a different cause, treatment by CAR T cells in 2017.
There is currently no randomised and controlled evidence indicating that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies by Immune Systems of Persons with CVID-19 Care to persons who need it is in the study as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SRAS with little results.
Viral neutralisation is the expected mode of action by which passive anti-body treatment can generate a defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as the cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotics, such as monoclonal antibodies manufactured, are under development.
The production of serums of convalescent persons, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of healthy patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus Diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan's central hospital, then contracted COVID-19 and died after paying attention to the spread of the virus.
