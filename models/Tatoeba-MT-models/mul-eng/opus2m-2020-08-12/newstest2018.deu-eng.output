Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view on the city
An Irish agency where young people are supposed to meet today.
A bunch of hats where they are now buried for the S-road tunnel.
Small farmers manage the sole reason for farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories in days.
It's nervous when maps are not available.
This is known by everyone who has already had to wake up because the car-ship instead of a walkway showed a green way.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlas, an offer of the State's geoportal Bayern, are all other than current - but that is why it is very close.
Especially when compared with current online cards.
Then it will be clear how cities and communities in the area of the münchner Mercur have changed since the 19th century.
The Bayern-Atlas digital is a flash tape that you don't recognize as such.
In the large overview maps, detailed maps were drawn up for cities and communities, so-called Urposition sheets.
These were created according to the details of the Bayeric Measurements Board between 1810 and 1864 and descended from the first Bayerns measurement.
Your orderant: Napoleon.
The French military leader served Bayern since the early 1800s during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical record of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.
Even if the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801: It was today's neighbors who created the idea of an expansive Bayern card.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph led the project further, founded the "Topographic Bureau" and thus the Bayerische measurement management.
The Urpositions Sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and is, like all others, found on the page of the Bavarian Country Library.
The comparison early/Today, for example, is the most impressive of the country's capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and is growing together.
An example of this is sentling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was appointed 21 years after the map was created, so 1877, as Munich City Hall.
Today there is delivery in the center of the city.
The Houses of Ambassadors will focus on 1856 along the present-day Plinganser street, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rise of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you see nothing as a field - at first glance: In the Hindu zoom there appears a smaller map with thousands of lines and numbers: manually numbered flower pieces from the so-called "outtake" from which the basic tax was derived.
Small parcels there are no farmers today - but small farmers of the plant "Land in Sun".
A large area of land is drawn north of dispatch.
In the 19th century, theresiensee, since 1810, was actually another way and no concrete remains.
On the other hand, the historical map has an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urposition page, you read not only the street names "am guestig" or from the height "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt" in the area of Au-Hidhausen today.
Yeah, here on the airfield street, one stopped people with van performances.
There the Münchner-Creis-Irenanstalt was created "On the Auer Air" in 1858/59.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard of God guided the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought into contact with the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the anchoring of the so-called irons.
He also told the staff to use violence against the insects," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Hayhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the agency.
For 280 patients it was first placed and later extended to 500 places.
Sometimes this capacity is no longer developed - the reason for the construction of the circuit assembly in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, there has been the Isar-Amper-Clinikum Munich-East, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.
In the area of the former Auar incident, young people are now meeting in Munich Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training companies.
West is the football spot of the TSV Munich East, east of the 1980s.
In 2015, the child house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural loan to the original construction of the Irenanstalt, which was destroyed in World War II by bombings.
The Marienplatz was named "Maint Place" in 1856, the shopping street was "buying Gasse".
The Second World War also brought about a decisive change in Munich's heart.
In December 1944 the bombs of the Allied rose many holes in the inner city.
A big one has remained to this day - at the Marine Court.
The English Institute, small business houses and a large chapel from the Middle Ages were located in the Marinehhof, where this day the preparations and on 5 April 2017 of the Spacestich for the second S-S train train race.
With the skirmisher, the old Munich map can be compared to today's air picture - and fill the hole at the Marinehof.
Public law group published travel notice for Missouri
The National Union for the Promotion of Coloring has issued a warning for colorful people who travel to Missouri because of discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will take effect until 28 August 2017, calls on Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouriers to pay particular attention to travel through the state and to be extremely cautious as a number of questions, racially based events have recently occurred throughout the country and are noted here in the Panel's opinion."
A recently adopted law by Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to obtain discrimination complaints, as well as the criminal authorities of the State which are not subject to minorities, forced the group to issue the travel warning, NaaCP said.
"They have violations of the rights of the people.
They will be arrested for their skin color, beaten or killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group cited events such as racist incidents against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gas during his journey through the state and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Secretary-General of Missouri that shows that black car drivers in the state are often held 75% higher than white.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be ready whether it brings bail money or let relatives know that they travel through the state."
Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 following the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting programme, which introduced the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the country's 16th rank.
Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company of housing or employment discrimination.
In the past, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona following the adoption of immigration laws by the States to impose on local criminal authorities the obligation to arrest people for violations of migration, which, according to the ACLU's view, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but interest groups have recently used the measures as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
The extension project is elemental
The fishing boat Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.
The CDU-Bunddays' organization Peter White and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture before the site.
At the Court of Justice of the Swendemann Family, representatives of the fishing pool CDU Orts Association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two officers.
Markus Swendemann first gave attention to his business, where he managed 55 hectares of Wiesen and 40 hectares of forest, provided 40 milk cows as well as many young animals and hosted in five apartments Holiday Guests.
The "Blackswald milk" is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cow, so Swedishman.
The holiday guests' table is exclusively regional.
Since he is also president of BLHV of Fischerbach, he referred to the extension project as "elementary important".
I can't afford to steal from such areas.
The green area is concerned with many jobs, many need to be processed with the engine sensor.
"We have to fight the conditions here and the topography," Swedemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and dentures, even if he did not lead a bio-business.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the extension project and is pleased with the leadership. "
In terms of costs of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare, farmers had to be supported.
It is hoped that the construction of the areas could be removed for a whole while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry on their business," said the Mayor.
Farmers are often in crisis due to the promotion
In 2013, 25 parts of 11 participants were totaled.
The opening area shall be 40 hectares, which shall not be forced up to at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71,500 euros, half of the leaders were supported, a quarter of the town of Fischerbach.
The farmers thus remained EUR 12,610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the pigs," Swedemann said.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You do a good job without farmers and rural women."
Peter White also stated: "Here are the best foods to be produced."
The Landing Management Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the State to promote rural areas.
The goal is to keep the black bear open.
The condition is that the presence of a promotional class named LPR.
In addition, the depleted area must not be inhospitable (up to 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by warming.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun 2018 project, the application is currently being made by eight participants with 24 pairs that want to build almost 16 kilometers Zaun.
The opening area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than EUR 112,000.
Isn't anything sacred anymore?
Now the white house of Trump is taking over the stand of freedom
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the stats.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully embedded storm Saddam Husseins at the Firdos Place in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key Ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic act in a current conflict with Jim Acosta of CNN on the president's proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigration with regard to the status of freedom.
To remain fair, Miller didn't catch the status itself.
A host of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have won him if he had done it.
But he took into account their importance, and in particular the importance that was written to you when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base.
When Miller Acosta intervened: "I don't want to go here on a whole thing about history, but the state of freedom is... an American symbol of freedom which illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original freedom status."
Miller is probably right, but as he himself formulated it, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's rising words, which are the only words in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poor's shepherds: "Your mothers, your arms, your oppressed masses, who then see themselves, are free to breathe, / the eventual loss of your rich coast."
There was never a time when it was better to see the "old waste" on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.
This conflict because of the importance of a statute is part of a wider political and cultural change: it is actually a conflict of the significance of America.
Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they were pursuing a high-level political action.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism by presenting the female body of freedom in a detached classic image.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her memory, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she owns a whole other name: the mother of the exilants.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Cup and a shameful attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change this from the right wing for a long time.
The great letter Rush Limbaugh, a species of John of the Tüuffer for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the stand of freedom does not invite anyone, but rather is an early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the dark world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is to bring the bill of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.
The bill is not to light up the way to the United States."
It's quite unusual that Limbaugh was thrown at something here.
The importance of the Statute is quite a question of the point of view.
The great fantastic act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the created, but hopeful people after a long and often terrible journey on the decks of ships.
It is in the real sense that we see the world from the perspective of people looking for refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Her status tells them the words of hope and welcome which they must hear.
And of course that's not the perspectives that Miller and Trump ever want to admit.
Her wallet should not illuminate the way, but the hass, which is her only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom team
Eilyh Doyle remembers a time when only two shots were on the British team
The Executive Director of the United Kingdom's Lightball Technology, Neil Black, says that the 16-headed Scottish quota in the World Championships Framework "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 which started on Friday.
Black believes that "it's developing something special in Scotland" and the United Kingdom's Leittalology needs to learn something about it.
"We like it, and we try to understand it, and we'll continue it until we find it," said Black.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British Light Telephony: It has something to do with what they've done.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is always, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medalists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who are represented against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m road, while Eilyh Doyle was elected by the team's captain.
"Eilhyh is pretty clear.
Your captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or practice, left the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Elihyh brought in was, of course, great."
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will appear at their fifth World Championships at the 400m Hills, says it's "unbelievably" that 16 shots are in the British Army.
So far, Scotland's total number of athletes was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle-tracker Wall is leading this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m run.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shot that you should watch after a great season that includes the victory at the British Team Trials and the University Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other shot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The men's captain says she's "very proud" to the fact that many of her country's people are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be involved in the media and the finals.
"The particular thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was also a great honor, but to know that my teammates have voted for me and have chosen me, it makes something very special for me," she added.
"I'm obviously very proud of all the shots belonging to the team.
It just shows us how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podium.
What do my words mean as a captain?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I have just pointed out that in this situation we are very happy because we have a world championship.
So it's really important to put this home support on and benefit from that we're back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it'll just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't complain about a public office if you can't hire the unit of voters
Our country's father knew something about bad pressure.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't last long until the newspapers beat him for everything, from internal politics to his political principles.
He's got a good time with the criticism, I'm sure.
But he didn't bring his critics to the pool.
For Washington said in 1783: "The freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stupid we will be led like the sheep to the slaughter."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on it to be more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted contributions from at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him at the beginning of this week.
The governor's staff fired the complaint as a freelance, and the online comment was full of a reaction with "No, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a type like Hogan.
This is a republican governor in a vast democratic state, which is wonderfully popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 rulers of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactive hit head.
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very much sent to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side.
That is why the blockade of people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum, which is officially designated and paid by employees with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post Hogan's speaker Amelia Chase defended the actions of the Governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolles or spammers or hamster-filled people who swim online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only true men who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a priest, not a trolley.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profan.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not full of hate, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I commented several times that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other news," she wrote in the comment section "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea, too, if a number of people take the same position on the same subject, then they will be ignored by some more than a so-called collective use and not recognised as a large group of citizens concerned."
What the Governor's staff called "concentrated spam attack" would probably call other people "professive".
The Facebook era makes it easy to share a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if workers were to do the same if they were sent to collect newspapers with critical guidance articles and to burn or arrest demonstrators and bring them to trial.
But exactly what happens is digital.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for having acquired Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is accused of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this issue came last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the board of supervisors of Loudoun County damaged the first amendment, according to U.S. District Director James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she joined a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
By Washington's time, the time of the hard port had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers increased between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writers joined in his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolle.
People who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisario" and "Portius", write all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized Amity's treaty, trade and shipping with Great Britain overruled his office, according to the historical documents collected by George Washington's online paper project.
But he didn't bring her into the pool.
Freedom of speech, diversity of opinion and discussion are based on our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty is expected to be at home in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East London is holding the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led up to the end in the Archerfield Links last year before he lost Paul Eales, is connected to the new location and serves as a tour mission on behalf of the Union founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how he achieved his peace with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he fixed this place.
He's an infamous champion of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great view window for this course."
The English Eales are happy to defend a masterpiece for the first time, although he has won both at the European Tour and at the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It really feels special," said the player in Southport.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it.
Back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories come back from last year, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year here.
It was a really special time and one we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50th birthday, returned to action at home.
This event will be its first Scottish event since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," Orr, the man from Helsinki.
"You want to do it well, but you also smell this additional pressure.
I've really enjoyed playing it again, and I've played a solid golf.
I'm glad it's been so long."
With the trio on the field are the former master's winner Ian Woosnam and senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance belong to the six shoots on the field, others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entry is free, the parking space costs £ 5 per car with one seat and £ 10 per car with two or more seats.

Low lung cancer due to passenger surgeries
In the past two decades, fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passenger surgeries.
As a result, scientists from the Hamburg-Eppendorf University clinic (UKE) come to a study.
"In our estimates, 167 cases of lung cancer are to be returned to passenger surges per year," said study director Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he conducted his own study on this subject from 1994.
At the time, 400 cases of lung cancer were reported in Germany due to passenger surges per year.
The new survey is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House locks are very complex
The construction works in the Villallinger Street are in full shape and are "somewhere in time", says the director of the building hall Fred Heinze.
In the area of household lockdown, the situation was more complicated than the situation, since much of it was hidden in the background, which was not noted in the plans.
The transport that keeps the construction work back on is a major problem for the construction of Stamp.
"The ignorance of car drivers in front of red ampels and ampelgitters is already huge," reports Heinze.
The road was closed and only the line buses were allowed to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stampp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already quite effortful.
But luckily, we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Goldland
If Bardina Degei bought dinner, she doesn't use any heat.
She even uses only a single top.
In her wooden house in Enorotali, the capital of the Panai Regent in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potatoes - local named "nota" - directly in the camel.
After a half hour, the frozen knot will be removed and crushed with dirty, unwashen hands.
Degei sits on the bathroom - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. washing clothes with dry water from the nearby soup.
An enamel in an open room serves as a latrine.
As the younger of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned to any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, it can be dangerous to work late: most villagers are unemployed, and many drinks are hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one waits to walk around the village after 17 hours," she says.
It is a rare view of daily life in the Highland of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was adopted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, as only 1,026 older people should vote in favour of public action before the occupations.
An existing movement aimed at independence against the Dutch government quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enorotali is as far away as it's cheap. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the main city of Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour drive from the car in the morning.
There are no public means of transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo floors and of well-bred roofs transformed by rose into different yellow-brown tunnels.
Only very few Indonesians have made their journey here, weak as journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Maye Pago Papuans honored a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes too.
"We weren't used to wearing this dress," says Digei and pointed to her vivid, hand-cuffed turban, her dark hat and her bright rock.
"In the past, we had only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's worst province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's Goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles away from Paniai, a state-of-the-art province of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has built 3.1 billion US-dollar gold and copper in value.
In addition, Papua has a value of $78 billion worth of wood resources.
However, these richmen are a source of the legacy for the Papua, which ensures that powerful Indonesian military guards maintain a remarkable presence.
A 2005 survey in New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004 to a single officer up to $150,000.
Papuanic demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden genes and are treated without reward.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua were killed and thousands were raped, tortured and arrested by the Indonesian military since 1969.
In the 1970s, mass attacks in Papuas Familyshochland were carried out in accordance with the Asian Commission for Human Rights on genocide.
Only in the region did the Indonesian police arrest more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We are going to lose everything" means in a 2016 report of the Erzdičouse Brisbane, which contains the report on the previous year's crop countries, such as some illegal orders and folders - rape and electric attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as each week events occur," says Andreas Harrisono, an Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been strengthened as Papuas resources have produced a stream of seafarers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the popular islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan warning canteens sell brothel and gado-gado, a mixed Gemuse with groundnus sauce.
Local people are fighting to stay here.
"The migrants have begun to sell pigs and gemuses on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Panai-in-Chiefist who went to work in Jayapura, the capital of the province.
"It cost the local Papua - the Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi in the People's Republic, has spoken during his 2014 election campaign to address the inequalities and legal damages in Papua.
The former roomman secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua it has changed little, and today it feels like the locals are involved.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi 2014 with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored," you say.
In fact, Panaii is only two months after Yokowi's inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children came out and sang Christmas songs before a campfire in Enorotali, as two Indonesian soldiers carried on a motorcycle through the darkness.
The frightened children told them that they should turn off their screenwriters.
One of the soldiers took a stand on their tone and later returned with four soldiers, so local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drank, hunt and beat the group with their guns, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers set fire to the children's group.
A child, 16-year-old Julianus Yeimo, was so badly killed that he fell into coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set in fire and things were scaled up the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bags and led the Waita-tanz - in the circle running and mimicking a bird song - by Papuas Mee Pago.
Some demonstrators began to swirling stones on police and military posts.
When the vote was heated, the soldiers were sent an order over an internal sound: "If the masses serve more than three times the resistance, they shoot them dead," says an official document of TIME that did not release the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the driving danger and called for peace and asked the number to return home.
No one was to listen to the vote.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly thrown into my left armpit," said TIME on the Veranda's beautiful wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who's fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overfilled, many shots were burned," he adds.
The local man Alfius You were hit three times, so his cousin, who was witness to the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said John, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, the TIME in a sad mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I bought him."
The chief inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers wanted to "safe" their station because they would be attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if people try to kill us," said the speaker of the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings came only on the following day 'filtered' after Jakarta.
For three weeks, Jokowi held a fine talk in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and found it difficult to attend the historical missteps in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said that he had set up an extrajudicial mechanism to deal with historical human rights violations.
But the excavation began almost immediately.
"Most injuries have occurred long ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to deal with these damages, but there are processes that must be passed," he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke with TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "all things are regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, who was charged by UNO for "crime against humanity", who claimed more than 1,000 victims of death in Osttimores of the 1999 bloodless independence agreement, said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been committed in Papua, including the panic incident.
Family members of the Panai victims took such charges against their immense lack of faith.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there have been no progress," says John.
"I'm a nun."
He says he's still in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he said.
"I am afraid to be arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Spain are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was shot by the military after half of the victim's death.
"After I had buried the bodies, the soldier searched for me," he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police attacked villagers in Panais neighbourhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between the villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious man into the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Doww, who had been drinking when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Ordered villagers protested before the company's local office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officials who responded by firing warning boards.
But domestics say that the mobile Brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we were afraid there will be cancer," says the 29-year-old Domingu Badi, who lived near the hospital and was witnessing how the victims were quickly delivered here, says the TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the authorities involved to take account and withdraw the police's mobile Brigade from the area.
Paniai was always a peacekeeper for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the indigenous May, Moni, Dani and Damal living in the green hill country of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, who claims to defend the rights of Papua by rejecting sporadic attacks and executions by Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In recent years, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai and voluntarily taken into account under the pretext of "ensurement of national sovereignty".
Some never get up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little trip that is sold in Enorotali is too expensive for domestics.
Brot is out of range.
People here build everything they eat: especially notes and fruit and leaves.
Agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sugar cane.
They keep the bulk of the income for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rubies (75 cents).
In time, economic differences between the local Papua and the new migrants have increased since the opening of new flights to the airport of Nabire.
The small jobs available in the region usually go to better-trained and well-equipped migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the skills necessary to conduct its own companies competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Panai tribal council.
Insulation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international media are being imposed.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with associated institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the leading Asian director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowis's election campaign was not realized in order to promote transparency and development.
"There are new risks for foreign journalists who are trying to report to the rest of Indonesia's restless eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to immediate neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread damages" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
These same countries have historically supported the OPM.
A spokesman from the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir showed the group's proponents back and said in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to exchange evidence for human rights."
People everywhere want more foreign governments to know about this.
As an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the direction of human rights messenger Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, visited, on May 4, domestically brought their weaknesses and forced him "We want freedom", according to a source that also wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say they are probably not going to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in panic attacks," says Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Panai people, apart from the constant threat of a rubber military, are in poor treatment and health services.
Gobai says that the Panai people, like others of Papua, consider their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" that he has to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and harassment, families of the Paniai Schussofer produced a last symbolic act of the Trotz: the body of a victim was buried on a ground exactly against the police and the military station.
They know that they may never be brought to justice, but at least they do not let the responsible forget their sins.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a low head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures the 'Torch' clouds of Dubai for the second time
On Friday, in one of the world’s highest residential towers in Dubai, a fire found its way through its book and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meters high to 79-strong buildings.
It's the second fire that goes through the High House in just two years, which is sometimes called the Torch Tower (Fackel Tower).
The building was evacuated, no damage was reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and stood at the fire alarm and the screaming of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a resident whose name was George Reuters.
The Dubai Civil Protection authorities said that the firefighting units at 4.00 p.m. Local time (00 p.m. GMT) destroyed the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing accommodations for the affected people.
The event can repeat questions about the safety of materials used in outer areas of houses around the world.
A study by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damages from clothing, external clothing for decoration or isolation came.
In Britain, the police said they believed that the system of plates for insulation and clothing at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid expansion of a fire which killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup Reform: Continue Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) was with his large Davis Cup at the General Assembly.
At the Ho Chi Minh City meeting, he was offered a revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup solo only on two gains, which was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five highly valued classifications are often very long, but also therefore still receive the traditional competition.
63.54% of the Member States voted in favour of the reform, which is why the aim of ITF President David Haggerty was only brief.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," Haggerty said.
It will continue to work to improve the competition.
It was not until a number of calls had been made for the proposal to issue the final at a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only relatively small details: So the finalists in Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the next year in the first round.
To reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in training sites etc. will be eased and players will need to complete less official media terms before Davis Cup.
More than 1 of 5 US passengers brings prohibited items into the aircraft, finds out a question
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 per cent of non-consciously prohibited items at the US Transport Security Administration’s control points were being tried, including at least 6 per cent of the aircraft being present while carrying deliberately prohibited mice or other items with dogs.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered late that they were mistakenly traveling with explosives, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the questions that they have sincerely tried to fly with something that was prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 per cent of the millions were compared with less than 15 per cent of the members of the X generation.
The most common substances that were deliberately pre-filled with TSA agents were food and fluids.
More than 3 per cent had to have significantly affected dogs by safety controls, while 2.2 per cent of female questionnaires and 3.7 per cent of male questionnaires also confirmed that they had brought deliberately prohibited drugs into the aircraft.
The company said it had asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many conveniently smuggled goods had been carried by the airport security and how many had done it on purpose.
It is not surprising that the people who brought the first smugware - deliberately or unconsciously - by the security, were the most often flying.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure which fluids they can take or how much of it can carry.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the largest amount of liquids prohibited by the TSA are prohibited by the TSA.
For a long time, people thought that TSA could view books as smuggler.
Flushing is permitted on domestic flights but not on international flights.
Elon Musk is equal to: tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders
Electro-Thaindsassa Elon Musk is pleased with the huge number of pre-orders for its new "Model 3" tesla.
He has so far suggested that part of the customers have already withdrawn their unconditional reservation.
In addition to the constant triumphal numbers of sales increases and even more giant sections, Tesla-Chief Elon Musk first mentioned another, less transparent number: the distortions in the new mass market model 3.
In the past months, Musk has often acquired more than 500,000 orders for the new car, whose delivery just started.
Now there is a muscle: Of the total 518.000 orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is only for non-binding reservations.
When a cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 euros (in the US $1,000 and in the United Kingdom of America $1,000) "Booking payment" in full.
At present 455,000 of such non-binding reservations are presented, with a voice in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the chief of Tesla does not believe that the cancellation of all orders could be a problem for about 12 percent.
His argument: The challenge in the ambitious growth goals is not the demand but the production page.
In the past year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 - all models will be combined - 500,000, 2020 a million.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk it is now available every day 1800 reservations.
Those who order a "model 3" today can count at least in the second half of 2018 with delivery - if Tesla creates its new and never-tested production routes without major interruptions with maximum output.
Many experts doubt that it is possible.
However, if there are too many delays, then the non-bindingness of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running away from it.
EPA Chief Fruitt is back due to the need to reduce emissions of Obama-Era rules
One day after he was charged with 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Authority, returned his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama-Ára rules in order to reduce emissions of toxic pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency demonstrated the needs of the state environmental authorities in response faster than the previous administrations.
He did not mention the complaint brought against his former position in a Federal Court of Justice.
It is a deadline for States on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for the nearby ozone.
In June, Prutt announced that he would postpone his stay for a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "injecting into local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Before his appointment by President Donald Trump of Oklahoma, he had long been a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental protection rules.
Since its arrival in Washington, Fruit has repeatedly passed on to block or delay regulations which are opposed to the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry.
The sudden return from Wednesday is the latest legal backlog for the fruit's regulatory rollback agenda.
In the past month, a federal court in Washington has decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority when he has tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, which requires oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce Methhanleks.
In an opinion published in the medium term, Fruit suggested that its turnaround at ozone standards would simply strengthen the readiness of the EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely implementation of the new standards.
"In previous administrations the EPA has often failed to keep the deadlines for implementation and is then expected to be charged by active groups and others and to establish in an agreement the time limit for implementation," Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a thousand times in its previous job.
"We do not believe in a regulation by means of judicial procedures, and we take time seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority it gives us."
However, the EPA’s view was that fruit will sometimes use its "authority to delay and all others legally available" to ensure that the rules "based on a sound policy and the best information available".
The Republicans at the Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A legislative draft approved in the last month will delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been adopted in the Senate.
New York’s general government official Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had accused the EPA this week, said that the group intended to maintain the legal pressure.
"The conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Colombia.
Ground-zone occurs when damages from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemicals and other sources react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of the public health and environmental protection celebrated the surprising change in the course of fruit.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this smart step from the air protection officer we're going to get," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological cross-cutting of the Trump government to offer ourselves to environmental pests and their particular interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years St. Hilarius Church
750 Years St. Hilarius Church: Due to the anniversary of the church of the mountain church, the old Friedhof area in Tumlingen will be invited to a ceremony on Sunday, July 16, at 16.30 a.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the site is the historic St. Hilarius facility a popular place to stay.
The visitors of the sixth benefiz series can be consumed from this powerful place.
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the area have made friends and supporters of Tumlingen on their premises.
Walter Martini points out: "It's a unique rural village."
In 1267 the St. Hillaryuscapelle was first officially mentioned in the Württemberg Urkundenbook: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the existing parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Master Eberhard of Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
In addition to the only parish church in Tumling, there was also a ruling court in which the church or the patronage law was heard and not converted.
So there were people there too.
According to the description of the city of Freudden, in 1858, it was near the basement and the Oberdorf, which are still known in the local picture of Tumlingen, the "Mount" of the third, the village's dominant settlement.
Old maps from time to year 1600 undertook these historical events.
The patronage law was based on the early self-carriage law.
A man who built a church, equipped and occupied with a priest remained owner of this church and could also corrupt this church.
The right to establish a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop was thus bound.
There were three elders in the church and two hours on the tower.
The size of the two most recent at Christmastime 1673.
The newly acquired clock then collapsed for the first time in 1692, but later in World War II in 1942.
In the 30th year of the war (1616 to 1648), the windowships were seized and the bells were stolen.
The roof was empty.
In 1796 French troops were stationed near the church.
They brought out the cancels and church chairs and used them as fuel.
The rest of the church tried to get involved in 1809.
Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last rest place for the deaths from the hearing ward.
The Freedhof was expanded in 1823 and the Hilarious Church was abolished.
Only the church tower was left to stand.
In the New Year's Night in 1834 a storm swept through the church and half.
To prevent an accident, the storm was interrupted.
Only today did the tower tower remain to be seen as evidence of the 750 years of old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffy Rentners" as a successor of Dieter Dockhorn is the Hilarius plant.
As organizers, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen were invited to the sixth ceremony on Sunday, July 16, to the old Peace Hall at St. Hilariousskalle.
This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local President Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Allowance is from 15.30 p.m.
On the outskirts of the Serenade there is a turning point in front of the Peace Hall.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view of views into the forest," says the organizers.
The serenade is located only in dry weather.
The organizers hope that many supporters will receive the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for tumlings and earphones.
Friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly obliged to provide home care, as Serenade-Organiser Walter Martini confirms.
One wants to check the approval of windscreens
"Boisheim is going to stand" does not see any legal condition for the construction and therefore has moved to the Landrate.
The Association "Boisheim Bet" has invited Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its authorisation for the establishment of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer network.
You've been wrong.
The Union argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boshiheimer Network, no wind power plants could have been allowed, since at the time of fours, there was only a wind power concentration zone at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind power plants are fundamentally possible, while the concentration zone is also contributing to the exclusion of wind energy from the rest of the city.
These areas should prevent a "destruction" of the landscape.
The city of Foursen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boshiheimer network a few days before a change in the land use plan - but the district government had not approved Düsseldorf because of a form error.
"By the lack of planning law, the given approval decision is still as legally binding and so is it," said Christoph Erekens, president of "Boisheim is against himself".
Current status of things: Before the summer break, the city Treaty has decided again the wind concentration zone in the Boshiheimer network; approval of the district government is still available.
Acknowledging: "This is why the distribution of a permit for the establishment of wind power plants is legally excluded".
The circle confirms the entry of the request.
"The corresponding letters have entered the circle fours since last week," said one speaker.
The circle shall be allowed to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to lead to the termination of the procedure.
In view of ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the circle did not want to appear on Thursday to the arguments of the "Boisheim" association.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning on an area on the Boshiheimer network the construction of four 200 metres high windscreens.
Already last year, the company where the city of Fourssen is directly involved had concluded contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares of large land.
With the creation of the four wind power plants, the electricity demand should be covered by around 11,400 households - which corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity demand for all foursene households.
The new Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
In the past summer, the Fourth City Treaty provided green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Windpark Linnich at Aachen and a participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crash together: A woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday at 10 a.m. on L 333 between the Lower Wallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Creis).
A woman was killed.
Two other persons were easily injured.
The road was closed over hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich with her Pkw during the accompanying ride with her 53-year-old mother is driving the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and dealer plan "Home Shops" weekend
Bad Langensalzer and people from the region are to re-evaluate their shopping opportunities in the city in September.
The business union and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the residents to the shopping bomb in the city.
As the President of the Business Association, Christian King, announced, the "Home Shops" weekend should raise awareness of the customer's offers that the city itself offers outside the ordinary Supermarket goods.
The plan is therefore a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, home companies should present themselves with their training sites.
In addition, the business of the city should be invited to the "Midnight Shops".
In this respect, the action is not limited to the inhabitants of the city and the region.
In preparation are advertising posts on the radio, an Internet video and printed beets that point to the action weekend, says Christian King.
City administration and business associations cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
So the business union and the city go to another stage of the "Attractive Innstadt" project.
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the source party and the sold Sunday, discussions with all operators and farmers to move them to active participation.
At the same time, attractive offers for Saturday and the show on parking fees are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential should be re-closed or re-opened.
This includes tourists and tourists.
But many domestics had also lost the city at the sale of the sight.
At the end, everyone had to contribute to living in the city - until renters, businesses throughout the city and associations.
It was appropriate for a network to overcome the lethargy that had spread part of it, the king had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, director of the IHK Centre in Mühlhausen, shared that he participated in the third "Home Shop" day, first five Thuringer cities.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, this is Weimar, Sømmerda, the Holy City and Bleicherode.
The day should be "for the evaluation of local trade and its importance for the common well-being of our cities", said the strike.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen can influence its own direct environment with its shopping behaviour.
Two deaths and several injuries after an explosion at US school
During construction work, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New other people were injured.
At a gas explosion in Minneapolis, U.S.A., two people were killed and nine more were injured, some of them seriously.
According to the fire weapon, another victim was in critical condition on Wednesday (on average).
A person dies when part of a school building collapsed at the explosion.
A first missing man was later also buried.
At the deaths, it was about school staff.
As a result of the accident, the authorities forced work on a gas pipeline.
At holiday time, only a few people stood in the building of the Minneha Academy.
Trump set up under pressure through secure transcripts of Mexican telephone calls due to the payment of the border wall
Documents from telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On 27 January, Trump asked for a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop telling the public that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The President of the United States arrested him because he had publicly called the wall and reported to him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States and to allow Mexico to pay for the project.
His first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also published and included an intensive exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for U.S. refugees who had emigrated to Australia would be "fashioned", "mys" and "dum" and that the existence of the trade transferred by the Obama government would make him look like a "dapp" after he had proposed a ban on the transfer of refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump finished the call after he said, "This is the most unacceptable call for all day."
Mores Ford Masker: Activists lead racist Lynchakt as a call for justice again
A 1948 Ford Mercuriy ran through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and ran to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridges, a group of white men with guns came forward to block his way.
The leader of the Mobs - a man of mid-aged age in a needleline approach - took a long train on his cigarette and looked through the windshield.
Inside, the insects flew into fear.
"We want this n--r Roger!" exclaimed the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Scream the silence when a young black man was shot by the driver's seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a follow-up.
But then when a sledge is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience stands out very real dreamers.
Since 2005, civil rights officers have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to follow up on the night in the two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were won by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one's ever been charged with murder.
"It is really impossible that no single person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the follow-up.
"It's a waste of history, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old Congressman of the state of Georgia and a live citizen.
For him, the follow-up serves as a dramatic call for action and is an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want persecution, we want the end, we want salvation, we want compensation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We can't get help and compensation until we get justice."
A court examiner puts a bed over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI acts received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding graveyards were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one's ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been on their own for decades, citizens say that the double motivation for Lynch actions has always been known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the presidential war in the summer.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI's report of the black farmer Roger Malcom, a white owner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - apparently due to a woman.
Brooks said the smell in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying wasn't from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white owner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, says the FBI.
He was taken to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they left the prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murder," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conflict between the state and local criminal prosecution which was not only involved in the murder, has been eliminated and has challenged the identity of witnesses."
Brooks is making it even more explicit.
"It was a fair massager," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, it will happen to you here."
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual follow-up to the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Its presentation is visible, understandable and is based on a kind of deep racism, which many would like to believe that it no longer exists in America.
It's hard to look at, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lion, because then we'll all be confronted with its cruelty," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or listen to what I've been through."
The tests for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 players – a thousand white and the rest of the black – were forced into a room and threw it into a room when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is the director of Greenes Co.
He's been playing the role of the Chief Clan Member for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.
"I feel sorry for myself because I'm not like this," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to get this story back in life because we don't want to go back to this time."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, are trying their lines.
The piece starts with Malcom, the horse beat and pushed him, knowing he slept with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said, n--he, disappear from my property!"
Rascona fires.
There's a break.
And then every one of them will come forth in the morning.
Greene laughed at the sound.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still looking.
"I just don't think that white people said 'an--he' at the time."
"However," one of the other black performers said.
"You just have to meet the hard 'R.'."
And that's where energy moves in space, a feeling of camerady replaces discomfort.
Everyone is involved in obtaining this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people who have been killed.
The scene is starting again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it is sharp and with pressure.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This recovery ends with violent and fast.
There's screaming, shooting and then stealing.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands over the body of the actors and leads Billie Holiday's sad lobby "Strange Fruit".
Your vote will be delivered in every second word.
About a hundred meters below, a group of about four thousand spectators grew white and tears from their eyes.
The audience is divided almost equally between black and white.
A couple from Ithaca, New York, are anxious to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They have experienced almost eight hours of pressing fatigue in Georgia when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcoms and Dorseys.
Until this point, the killings have remained anecdotes, but now when you stand on the same country where the Lynch murder took place, the air feels tense.
When the last notes of the song are out, Greene invites the amount to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children stare at their heads, register the fake blood and the quiet bodies and fluids.
"They're not really dead," laments a young boy who wants to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the amount - and suddenly it is over.
The players throw the Lynchseil away and wipe off their trains.
Bradshaw's in love with Marbaugh, the man who played the Clanmit member.
Nick Rascona surrounds two of his players and then takes them together with her arms, and the emotional burden of performance finally comes through him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know it's not in your heart.
You did it for one reason."
Later, the audience will meet with the players for dinner.
On a table a white couple from Atlanta reacts to the follow-up with a black couple that they have just learned.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the performance feeling.
"It's hard to hear these horrible words and deeds... from people who look like you yourself and who do it because they look just like you," she said.
"What it really does to me, let me believe that the ring is still going on," she added, "Today it's only called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks is holding the Court on his desk, he eats and remembers the rights of citizens.
He said he's already started to plan the performance in the next year.
"The follow-up is certainly inspiring, for it describes the horrors of what we have achieved, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
He who does not study his own history, who does not know his own history, is sentenced to repeat it."
"Göttwerming" awarded the Wagners in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, Director Frank Castorf also places a fine-frequency insinuation in front of a giant, six-six-stucking cult.
The Drehbühn (designed by Alexander Denic) is a beautiful street corner, as well as Mauerrest and Dunerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from DDR times or the New Yorker Börse.
Before this, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer park where the reindeer is located as Rockergirls or alternatively an icetta.
Founded olives remember Castorfs leitmotif - money, power and energy - which is drawn by its "Ring" insinuation.
The three reindeer - beds of Stephanie Woodzeel, Wiebeke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonise as already in the "Rheingold" wonderful.
They run Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), close a body in Hollywood Manier and give the Krawallo Click.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderful fetish hagen surrounding the Aura of a heavy weight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he suggests victory.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eike) must also believe in the dragon.
The audience thanks the assembly for its strong appeal.
Sturmish festivals are celebrated by Foster, Milling, Vinke and Director Janowski, who wake up and wash their hands to the Merkel wheels.
There is great case for the party-playing orchestra, which is shown on the stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in lighter leisure clothing.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his regiment team was eagerly expected.
If he had to go through another valid pfeif concert in 2013, five years later there was a big jubel in which the united "Buh" called.
Captain Katharina Wagner must have enjoyed this.
"It is noted that the public has grown up with the "Ring" in a certain way," she said shortly before the execution of the dpa.
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has also been an understanding for its outlook.
I'm drawing a positive summary.
Max works as a volunteer
They work in their holiday year in several places.
Where is it?
Quantity: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture brüse, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture brüde.
And I've been working at school all day.
How are your experiences?
Quantity: It's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 years old, so you're a late volunteer.
How's that going?
Quantity: I've made Abitur.
And then a construction study, we say we're successful.
I knew it was wrong for me and I wanted to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked myself what you were doing.
It's a social year, there's an idea that you can see how it's in front of the place, maybe at the point of fire, maybe it's real.
Where was it?
Quantity: I've collected great impressions.
I'm going to start my studio in the social environment in winter.
I'm going to study twice, probably doing social work training in Jugendamt Herne and studying in Hamm at the University of Technology.
Is it not unusual to have several different types of use during volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
Maybe it's always about where you make your FSJ.
You can make it from the old home to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work.
It was very different for me.
I was also part of the OGS, so I was in post-mortem management.
For me, that was exactly the right thing to do.
I could recognize my own strength and see how it really works.
What about the construction studies?
Amount: Of course, here it is not about counting statistics.
You always have other people in your head who each have a whole other story behind you.
Whether a refugee or a youth who has been expelled from the family - you must always go to it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any contact?
Quantity: I'm not the type for that.
There's a lot of space.
A lot of love, a lot of friendship.
There are even negative moments, but that's how life works.
Pearson cuts more 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividends to relive the business
The British Pearson Education Group said on Friday that it will increase by 3,000 jobs and cut its dividends by 72%, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure faced by the company.
In addition to its previous restructuring, which was announced by Director General John Fallon for the end of 2018 and early 2019, it has already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, in a third cost reduction programme, Pearson announced a cost reduction plan for another 300 million dollars (394 million US dollars) to relive a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company that had sold its share to Penguin Random House to the partner Bertelsmann last month said that the outlook for the business year had not changed since it had reached an increase of 1 per cent to 2.05 billion dollars in the first half of the year.
Convoi attack by Kabul: Nato soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide killer has attacked a military convoi in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a soldier of Nato and wounded several others, says officials.
Five soldiers and a Dolmetcher were injured, shared a statement by Nato.
As a result of unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the city of Qarabagh.
The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has experienced this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday a suicide killer killed two people near the Iraqi message in Kabul.
In Nato's opinion, the explosion on Thursday evening was carried out when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "unproprofessional explosion of people"".
The statement states that all victims are in a stable state and are treated at the airport Bagram in the U.S. military hospital.
Correspondingly, the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabagh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly skirmish district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a violent bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly military attack in the country, since the US-led troops raped the Taliban by force in 2001.
Violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump intends to increase the number of US troops supported by the military and police in the country.
Correspondingly, the suicide rate in Kabul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular in the call of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reiterates its decision to delay the smog rule after complaints
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has a decision to delay regulation of Obama's government, which is why the states are obliged to reduce the noise caused by emissions. This took place one day after 15 states accused the Agency of taking action.
The EPA announced late Wednesday the decision to move forward the so-called "Ozone Provisions 2015" and said that it would show the Agency's obligation to cooperate with States.
"We believe in the dialogue and that we respond to our public partners," said EPA Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the EPA to measure ozone-depleting provisions in part of the country's waste emissions in order to determine where cuts must be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, together with the region of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The Government of President Donald Trump has tried to restore a wide range of environmental ceilings, which former President Barack Obama has set aside as part of a broader agenda that, according to Trump, is to foster economic growth.
However, efforts have solved the backlog of democracies and nature groups which are concerned about the impact of higher emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that the intake of air, which contains the ozone, "can reduce the lung function and enhance the respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
The Community Council wants a Community space
Finally, the decision was clear: in two contrasts, the Council of the Community decided to establish a Community room in the future ageing facility.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The contract of purchase for the missing part of the piece is signed, says Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will continue to last until the area of the church is in the community, there is no planning obstacle to the project which a private investor is voting for.
There is a discussion on a Community space.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to oppose the Community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living area - about 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square metres area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the Community Council propose that such a Community space should be provided not only for the residents of the old-age right-of-occupancy but also for the Community.
For example, the word "strickcafé" made the round.
The decision which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget will be deleted by means of promotional opportunities.
The building is located in the sanitation area.
The establishment of a Community space would, according to Tjaden, be beneficial by 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
The proposal for a decision to signal to the investor that it is not intended to cast a link between the legs, to state that both satellites - what is involved in environmental construction - and Puldach - would be possible to reduce the level of stress and make economic growth possible.
No need, that's not just Wilfried Sohmer, be this addition.
If it helps, he'll pass the gremium.
It's not that simple in the Community.
Daniela Ruf refers to many of her own buildings with which you do not come so straight, so that you can now leave the window in the community room, she says, "I'm hard to do this."
Yvonne Staiger speaks unconditionally for the Community room, however, absolutely against a municipal involvement.
You see below a hidden subsidy to wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area, you do not give a contribution, but you get a real marketable present in doubt.
Mr Staggers' request to distribute the motion for a decision shall be made by three speakers.
This remains true in two contrasts with the original programme, which includes Stefan Haller: "If we take the decision this way, we will make a huge step towards ending a huge accident in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: Radler is locked on the street
A 82-year-old driver was hit by a car on the road in Garath on Wednesday.
As the police reported, the 82-year-old Longfield was on its way by 12.20 p.m. with his bike on the road of the road Blacker Road from the direction of Holden.
The senior wanted to cross the train at the height of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A Pkw leader in the same direction gave him priority.
When the long fields were on the road, however, he obviously did not look at the opposite.
He stopped with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildenerin.
The man was locked on the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a wheelchair.
FC Bayern München has to pay for David Alabama and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup finds no place for him: David Alabama has to leave the game against Dortmund.
With personal care, the FC Bayern travels to the first duty game of the new season after Dortmund.
Seven professions lack the title protector in the Supercup against the poker player.
The staffing of the German Football Record Master Bayern Munich on Saturday (20.30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport) at Pocalsier Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also apply to David Alaba in duell with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
The Münchners are also missing Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boating, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five lower levels in the previous six test games, Ancelotti has taken responsibility for the physical condition and balance in the play of his team.
"We know we are not in the best physical constitution," said Ancelotti and added: "The most important point is balance in the team.
It wasn't good at last."
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official part of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my men show these qualities.
The crew is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "hard, intense game".
The duel of both German football weights draws fans into their band.
The party was sold with 81,360 spectators, sharing the German football League (DFL) on Friday.
In the heart of stars to stars
The first "star path" is to be established in the heart.
This plant is planted by the United Star Warte Sankt Andreasberg.
A planet path is available in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" is contrary to the need for information by many heart visitors.
It combines nature, science, movement and sports performance.
Members want to set up the planed route tables and inform them about stars and star images.
In a first phase up to 2018, the company is planning "well- Achievable installations in five to six locations" in the upper ward.
Questions came from St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Highgate and Siber.
The information on the tables should be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Barrier freedom is also a criterion.
The star path should then be extended to train.
"The viewers experience a lot of knowledge on the star path, for example about the physical nature of the individual stars," said the Society.
They also learned why stars had different colors or why one star was more bright than another, although it is far more distant.
It will also be transmitted in which star image is a selected star and when it is best to see.
The association has been operating since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg, which is the highest-ranking star in Northern Germany.
The location in the centre of the National Park Harz is reported by the Federal Agency for Natural Protection to the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often from there they are from the milk road and even seen the Andromeda galaxy with only one eye.
Since 2003, there has been something similar to the planned starning - the planet path.
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet path leads up to the Hainberg and to the Stargate - as well as a "external" location in Diemarden (Gemeninde Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The stars with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded at the end of the planet - are located exactly at a distance and a level of up to two billion.
The earth thus falls on a ball of 6.5 millimetre diameter, while the sun, which is about 75 meters away, is almost 70 cm away.
The entire distance of the planet's path is well four kilometers.
While the light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours, footmen need a good hour to stand with Pluto.
So footstepers are faster than the light in the world.
The march would last another half year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a college course to introduce the most exciting box fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the uninterrupted World Boxing Council Lightweight Championship, which went down the river to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federweight Championship.
According to Garcia's victory through a single decision on the former four-division World Master Adrian Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the top five Pounds for Pounds list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his throat against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 19 o'clock on ESPN.
As the couple for photos, Lomachenko-Manager Egis Climate observed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
"I'm a former fatty weight," recalled Garcia.
"I've been raised for supplies [of 140 pounds], but I'm not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to light weight.
And he has to move on light weights [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let us give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The box needs this fight."
Klimas asked whether it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debett this year in order to agree with Garcia in the next summer (37-0.30 Knockouts) which also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their light weight fight in the forum on 23 September.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for him," said Garcia and then pressed out to fight the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can make this kind of attention.
When they're always ready ... "
Garcia said he valued Lomachenko as "a great fighter", and perhaps he would participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko joined the great dance for Garcia and said that he thought that the three-fight champion from Riverside "very slow out, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the Ko-Aus".
Garcia said the focus was to show strengths, then boxing.
They both said they could smell the moment they built up for their own fight.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
There is no other fight that brings so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighter, and that's Mikey.
It'll be a great fight."
Four Foundations
In an accident on the A7, four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle shortly before 16.30 p.m. before the connection station Market width probably after a train station.
The Pkw jumped right into the bunker where he crossed and then stayed on the roof in the green strip.
The four nurses - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident.
During the first care of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked in the north for about an hour, followed by transport on the left side of the accident.
Fortunes Hoffmann: "Three chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2:2 for the season's impact on Braunschweig that optimization of the transformation formation brings to Aue points.
With the first season game Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result too, the two generators would not have been there at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two generators too much, and we need to get even better up in Aue," says the playwright of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the mountains, the triangles should also be further optimised.
And a door after a free ride will no longer catch the fortunes.
"For the future it will be so that no more Michael (Rensing) puts himself on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better suited after the experience in preparation with the three-wheeler than with the four-wheeler.
"I still don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his case, "because we have players who can build well in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gielmann," said Hoffmann.
"It's a preposition, but that we're even better harmonised and we don't make so many errors in building."
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can speak after a difference of a failed start, you don't know.
The performance could be quite okay," Hoffmann said.
"But if we go down on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the pocal, we will certainly be able to speak from a regular seasonal survey."
He didn't want his trainer to know anything about it.
"The start in the season I'm only assessing after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who did not want to speak out against Aue, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be interrupted earlier because of a stranger.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that the Aue players might even be somewhat fresher, since they had no heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascendancy in the bones.
"But they don't know where they're at right now," says the interior defender of Fortune.
Although the guests from Rheinland go as a light favorite on Sunday to meet in the final (fast) finished stadium of Aue.
"That we leave them, just because we have the claim to come under the first six, is blood," says Funkel, whose balance in the case of a single landing against Aue from nine games is very positive.
"There is no man in the 2nd Bundeslaga, which must be beaten before," explains Fortunas Chefcoach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and excessive."
And that's how Funkel wants his players to experience no case on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish asylum assessment test are published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which were submitted to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years of age. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedinalwerket) has started the tests last year.
They should make the age assessment more accurate during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migration Network) has been criticised for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
Up until now, migration has sent 6,880 cases to test and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the time of mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "probably 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "probably under 18 years of age".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the person's age is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are stable during the past months.
"We see no great difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are quite constant," he said in The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases "proposing that the person under investigation was 18 years old".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she concluded that in 243 of these cases the person had said that she would be 18 years old.
The method of medical age assessment, which is made in the course of taking wisdom lessons and MRT seizures of kidney connections, then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological range of people to see whether they went earlier or later than usual through puberty.
"I had reason to think about it, and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used.
The biological age to be assessed in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it safely, we shouldn't do it as if we could," said Metro newspaper.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is that if the person is nearly 18, this is about 10 percent."
Full Plan
The work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is well ahead.
On Wednesday seven tons of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, Bauleiter at the Department of Roads and Transport in the Freiburg government Bureau.
In April the work began at the same time at all three necessary sanitation bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The building is planned for October and light is sure that the schedule will be kept.
The first bridge from Schramberg leads through the trumpet.
It is a wooden bridge of concrete, which is decorated with red sandstone and has a total length of 4,80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the two other bridges, they have come in the middle of the years.
In order to ensure stability and safety of transport, the three construction works are now basically supervised.
The two other bridges lead through the Louterbach.
They are built from red sandstone.
Both were created in 1939 and are twelve, relatively 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1,30 metres wide and seven tons of heavy bridge cap this Wednesday morning.
This is a border attachment which is also used as a business path.
In the southern part of the bridge, a 2,20 metres wide bridge head should be used on Friday.
Then walk the path.
The particular thing is that it's part of it, a patent of Schranberger's firm Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge heads.
A special touch of fingers has required the delivery of instructions through the construction work in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass façade cable that is connected to many companies.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work list.
In addition, fish and crustaceans had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building building and the assembly in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by an ampel.
For construction at the bridge at the Louterbacher Location entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden".
The costs for the three bridge repairs shall total EUR 700 000.
The whole country will be financed.
AfD in Gerolstein: Lower protest at German Cartofelsalat
It does not appear so often that parties are attracted to a strike, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is only hard to bring under a hat.
The parties (CDU, SPD, Grüne, FDP, FWG, FWG, Linke) represented in the Crestag Vulcaneibell are part of a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on this day because the AfD in the Gerolstein City Hall roundall is invited to the poster "great electoral impact".
And famous names at the start - like Alice Weidel, who, together with Alexander Gauland, forms the peak duo for the German election on 24 September, and the vice-president Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD students but demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains positive."
The city picknick was originally planned under the motto "All on a table" on the source site, but now it is located on the parking lot under the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those coming to the AfD event in the city hall.
It's a great picture that offers.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forum A world and one of the important organizers, is really happy: "Toll how many people have come together here."
There is music and every amount of food, including a "Ur-German potato salad that can also eat the AfD without problems," says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officials to go to Gerolstein, which shows presence in particular at the train station, which is only a few metres away from the event sites.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reported by the AfD Vulcanievel, he has been working on such an event and has received the supplement.
The 45-year-old from Günnersdorf had first been questioned in Daun, but there was a complaint because there were not enough parking places because of the already built Laurentiumskiremes.
So the roundall, Hompes, is glad that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
With a view to the event at the Roundtable, he says: "This is the right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful."
This is also true: at 20 o'clock, there is a band for maintenance in the city hall of several speakers, including the head of the Reinland-Pfaltic AfD.
There are about 200 audiences waiting for the top candidate for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and the vice president Beatrix of Storch to hold their talks.
The police presence has not changed, but for a long time the officers had a quiet night.
AfD event takes more than an hour, the guests on the front floor have a longer breath, but there is also a short walk up after 21 hours.
The police can withdraw - no special incidents.
Tromppete trofft posaune
A rehearsal with the Wolfarian Posaunist Frederic Belli is held in the Haslacher monastery concert in the morning, Sunday, at 20 o'clock in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he has a concert under the motto "Black Sea hits on Blackzwald", or "Balkan folklore" on a classic German training with roots in glass music.
Both soloists are winners and prize winners of numerous international competitions and have solutions in European top orchestras.
This is how Petkov Solotrompter is named at the concertgebouw Orchester Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the Solopopounist of the SWR Symphonie Orchester.
Both combine the pleasure not only to exceed the limits on their instruments but also to mix the limits of the different genres.
In this way Johann Sebastian Bach explains to the two as in a new wall, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the "Exchange Suite" section of the Nils Wogram's jazz priest, he combines classics, jazz and free games into a fascinating work of art.
This section of the programme was launched this morning with great success in Freiburg.
The famous composer Nils Wogram wrote it for the two musicians and more: The Hasslacher Klaster Church with its special acoustics will be known for its involvement in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her sexuality
"Some people love roasted cheese and will eat it until the end of their life.
But I want to try everything," says Christian Stewart.
"When I'm in a grilled case, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what comes next?'
The most famous relationship of Hollywoodstar was that of her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who finally had a bitter argument.
Despite all this, the brilliant designer assures against the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I've been in love with every thing I've dated.
Or do you think I was playing it?"
After her separation, Kristen said that she was bisexual: "I have always lived the dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it's never bothered me or stopped me.
I just never had to take it seriously."
In particular, she said "Bang Showbiz" but in school time when she preferred to dress like a doll: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me very much.
When I was 11 the kids told me I'd look like a bub.
I felt really hurt, hurt and humiliated.
Now I look back and think to myself, 'Girl, be proud of you!'."
Especially for the public, they do not like their life of love: "People expect you to be treated in a certain way and to honor me.
And maybe some people call me impotence, but I don't like to have to justify myself before the whole public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces he's changing the party
. The democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced a Thursday evening at a customer conference with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have gone away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and many thoughts ... today I will tell you as a citizen of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The customer service ended up in Jubel.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," added Justice.
"As a coach I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously made a great announcement at West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not legalize the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes of the only billionaire in the state, was chosen in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coalmines in five countries and has acquired a coal business from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the National Committee of the Republic made a statement on Thursday evening, in which it said: "The change in the party of Governor Justice is a further blow to a democratic party which would prevent us from working more than to make our country grow."
"With only 15 governments and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last departure of a party that is from above to below without leadership and is unable to find a positive message," RNC President Ronna McDaniel told CBS News in a statement.
Coe praised "true" Russian apology for Doping scandal
The world leader of Lightballics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as a public apology from Russia as a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to be taken back into the sport.
During the IAAF Congress, Russia's Head of Leichtatelletics Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the night of the World Lytathletics Championships that his country's connection was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were removed from the competition for gold and silver medals".
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress agreed to the maintenance of the ban, which was held in November 2015, following a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) on State-supported Doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told the reporters.
"The whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "satisfied" about Russia accepting the criteria for its re-introduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the time to re-enter Russia," Coe said.
"We have to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the pure athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will be represented on Friday in London as neutral actors by the IAAF criteria.
The Head of IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a return.
Drug services are still insufficient and banned trainers are still free to work, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Traumatic experience for retired soldiers in Mali
During a grief festival in the Northern Fritzlar, about 1,000 people of both of them thought of soldiers who had come to Mali during a hurricane.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the city of Domstadt under high security conditions.
For yet unexplained reasons, Minister of Defence Ursula of the League (CDU) said nothing.
She named the two incoming pilots as "Kings of their profession".
"We are ashamed of this greatest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from Northern Hemisphere came to life on Wednesday one week ago in West Africa.
Her tears were transferred to Germany and brought on Thursday with her by a German death watch in the Fritzlarer Dom St. Peter.
Only the members of the church first took part on Wednesday.
Then the grief festival in the family circle, close friends, began by representatives of the federal government and politics.
Among them were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the German Inspector General Volker Wieker.
Dear guests put roses down, the fellows stood arm on the hills.
Before the church, fritzlars and many soldiers followed the ceremony on a wall.
The Defence Minister of the League designated the incoming soldiers as "high decorated" and used them.
The Chief of Staff has built the flight operation of the fighter Tiger in Fritzlar and has been one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regime.
People Farmershas, the commander of the regime, to which the soldiers belonged, also stated: "If this occupation could not separate the chaos, it would not have been possible for anyone".
No doubt at the UN mission in Mali, the minister of the League did not show: the use was dangerous.
But he was also of high importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the mourning festival the tears were removed from the chamber.
When and where they are provided, the Federal Navy did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik won't take care of his wife.
The man of the Danish King Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be supplied with his wife after his death.
This was shared by the King's House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal pair will be added to the Domkirche of Roskille.
The picturehouse Björn Nørgaard has already completed a Sarkophag for the two.
If the Queen agreed with her husband’s decision, it continued in the message.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, it's still unclear.
But he did not intend to be included in his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a wish that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife, Margarete, died in 1972, he was willing to become king.
He went to the restroom in 2016 and also released the title "Principal meal".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted, he did not see himself equal to his wife - not even after death, Lene Balleby, chief speaker of the Danish Royal House.
Where the last rest of the 83 years will finally be, it is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be included in his French home, but in Denmark.
He's been working for the country he's worked for in the last 50 years.
The married Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French nobleman, had met Margarette in 1965 in London.
On the subject he worked in the French message.
While his later wife was constantly empathizing with the people’s sympathies, Prince Henrik had a difficult position in his nearly 50-year-old government in the teeth.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first year in Denmark: "A few months after I arrived, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was changing, I preferred wine instead of beer, side drums instead of cracks, citroën instead of Volvo, Tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and the countries to whom I had the call to become the brand of social critical intellectuals, I couldn't hope to see it.
I was different.
I seemed to be content with this position and not to be ashamed of myself.
That was the same two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants a quick new election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
The Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is not going back after the loss of the red-green government majority for a rapid election of the country's day.
Because he spoke on Friday for Parliament's resolution.
In the past, the surprising Austria of a Green Group from its rural group in the Netherlands had forced the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official term of the country election, the red-green coalition in Hanover was lost in this way by their small single majority in Parliament at the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The so-called Greens-Ordered Elke Twesten founded its step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in its electoral circle in Rotenburg (Wumme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said on Friday in Hannover.
Head of CDU Group Björn Thumler wants to recommend that his group include them.
As a result, CDU and FDP together had 69 seats in the Netherlands Land Day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new farm day will be selected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thuller said that the red-green country government must now decide whether or not it can continue to rule in this situation without the majority.
Stephan Because, however, it is essential that the country day decide its own settlement as soon as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further progress on Tuesday.
The country constitution also provides for the possibility of the country's day of withdrawal from the Prime Minister and choosing a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be properly tested," Thumler said.
"We will discuss all questions in peace when they are duly examined."
Thumber called Twesten's step "but something curious."
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She named herself an attachment to Black Green.
The Greens called on the retired members to return their country-of-the-art mandate.
"We are of course going to conclude that it will return with immediate effect to its country mandate, which has received it through the Green Country List," the country presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner shared.
The president of the Green Group, Anja Piel, said: "We regret the decision of every question."
She has decided not to speak in the group.
"Even before the background there were no substantial differences, we cannot follow this step."
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the over-representation of the Dutch Green Group every tweet on CDU as a traitor.
"The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters and voters, but also a betrayal of red-green," wrote the Federal Head of Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to re-elect the country day quickly.
The Austria of Twestens costs the majority of Red Green in Lower Saxony.
The politician is "in her wounds and in her breasts her personal interests before the good of the country", criticised SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony shares and tries to defeat political capital."
The Head of the CDU Group Björn Thumler will recommend that his members include each issue in the CDU.
The head of the SPD Group on Bundesag, Thomas Oppermann, was trying to fake the results of the 2013 country election with personal career memories.
The CDU was the strongest force, SPD and Green before the SPD, but on the day of the earthquake, a high-density majority of a vote.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from weddings, Mr. Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in interview with the Editation Network Germany (RND).
Mr. Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from contaminated eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to take a closer look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the voice pressure.
At the Consumer Protection Portal www.foodwarning.de, the Germans will provide each of the latest information on the Eire Charges concerned.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or withdrawn.
Even if, after all we know now, a health threat is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the publisher's central role is not really taken by the German Ministry of Agriculture?
Food surveillance is the task of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Nevertheless, my house has been closed immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since Germany's notification.
All information and risk assessment are available for consumers.
The trade is just as concerned as the manufacturer is to ensure that the products sold are transportable and healthy.
In the case of eggs, the maximum residue level of 0,005 mg/kg is exceeded, they are not transportable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time it's not the business.
Do production companies and consumers sit on the same boat?
According to current knowledge, production companies do not have direct debts.
In many cases, they have to calculate economic damages due to illegal practices by service undertakings.
As always there is too little control in the pregnancy case.
Is it lacking only in the staff or in the exclusive responsibility?
However, it was just the official controls that covered the procedure.
However, it is also true that food consumption and criminal energy can never be excluded by 100 per cent.
That is why a consistent disclosure of such events and the transmission of them to government authorities in cases where penalties may be imposed are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect an unfavourable explanation from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism really necessary for food canals?
Consumers and consumers have the right only to obtain safe and transportable food.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food business, consumers and consumers shall be brought to justice.
By means of the funds provided, manufacturers, dealers and consumers have been placed in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
Basically it must be clear: the illegal use of fipronil insecticide in the maintenance of food-supply animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This has to be consistent at all levels and worked with high-pressure.
I hope that all the competent authorities will be able to explain the case in a slow and successful manner.
How the financial rules of the football are affected by the conversion of Neymars to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure by the European Football Associations will not distort the world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.
Some consequences will still come to Paris Saint Germany from the UEFA, because the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to prevent men from accessing the prestigious Championship League tournament.
Financial Fair Play Rules, which were called by UEFA in 2011 means that PSG must at one time prove that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) in order to buy the Brazilians out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a amount worth several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's conversion to France.
PSG can certainly make money locker so Neymar can sign up and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, in view of the team's funding by the power-rich family of Qatar.
A group can use a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but it must be opposed to legitimate sources of revenue that enable them to break-even point in their business on football.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that companies that had made huge debts in their pursuit of success effectively betrayed and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP decreased from the concentration on the debts of the club to the monitoring of their losses.
The amendment meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global market - should become a more difficult issue.
During the current three-year FFP settlement period which runs until 2018, Clubs may receive losses of EUR 30 million.
And even though Platini 2015 has fallen from the presidency in Ungade, his UEFA successor Alexander Ceferin continues to hesitate to reduce excessive expenditure.
"Surely FFP is not dead and we will still strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, compared to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the Buy Out clause of Neymar in a breaktable, it can share the amount for the calculation of the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the amount of the cancellations for the next five years can be allocated up to EUR 44.4 million in the year-end.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has met the PSG with Abu Dhabi, who is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at the time of 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 season league remain limited to 21 players instead of the other normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to over-list its financial supervision by keeping their revenues from companies connected with the owners of a club.
While an Atlantic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsoring should exceed the standard market values, UEFA would not allow this as legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was highlighted by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG payments could come to Neymar on payments from the WM 2022 organisation committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have struggled to become Neymar WM messengers and such a manoeuvre could easily be found for UEFA regulatory authorities.
The above-mentioned sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more careful to observe any attempt to comply with the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, saying on Thursday the people who are confident of the situation.
They spoke under the terms of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not able to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 has achieved a profit of more than EUR 542.4 million with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the last business year must still be published.
PSG expects Neymars to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and Trikot sales.
The unit considers that the trade after the signing will increase by at least 30 per cent.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymars leaving by claiming that PSG would damage the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's latest ownership of PSG.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose union is owned by an American sport tycoons, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that funds a unit.
"It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has a union, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay because there are different ways or different interests when a country has such a large actor to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new Scotch Provider
In the past years, chocolate Free Board chocolate has been produced for the Swiss.
The sweet cooperation now stands before a possible end: The airline re-written the order.
Swiss speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on the request of the news agency sda an appropriate report of the newspaper "North-West Switzerland" on Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be tested every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"With the current supplier Chocolat Frey we are very satisfied," said the speaker.
About 17 million small red-haired Scoggig Tables are distributed to 14 grams per year by air carriers before landing to passengers.
The Swiss wanted no information about the costs.
Sector sides estimate the volume of orders according to "North-West Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual rate of around one billion francs.
More importantly, however, is the advertising effect: For a shoe manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
As many applicants are present in the new edition, the Swiss do not want to report.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are concerned.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to try to renew the agreement on the spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion.
The Swiss share chocolate tables on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The opportunity to place the logo led Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with chocolate Free.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights the customers of the first class are rewarded with lecheries by the conferier Springli, in the business class following passengers Schoggi by Lindt and in the economy Class Shoggi by Chocolate Frey.
Also on the short line, Swiss Shoggi distributes chocolate Free, both in business and in the economy class.
Lyrics - Discus-Olympian Robert Harting reaches the WM-Finale
The three-year-old world master is fighting on Saturday in the finale about a medal.
His brother Christoph, a 2016 Olympicsman, was divided into the national WM resolution and could only watch the discussion competition from the Tribon.
Also, with the first attempt, the Polish-definitioned Piotr Malachowski, who was 65.13 meters far away, qualified for the final battle.
Nostalgie goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the Nesque
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the '80s, for the '90s-Grune-Ára' (as the predecessors David Wain and Michael Showalter were the Sketch Comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to greater things.
As a cultural artifact, it is also a parody and a corrosion of our Facebook-able era of permanent memories.
But as Franchise, it feels like time would be short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it included an original history of a speeching dose of Gemüse, spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By hiding on the core of the gang - middle-aged players play gay children who will grow up - they still created the opportunity to win back the last part of the white.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults who are now playing adults, is less emotional and its parishioner goes more according to the yellow principle, including a call on the stocker film of the '90s like 'The Hand That Rocks the Cradle' ("The Hand That Shots'").
At one point, a character is shaped by an Apple Powerbook, some Inline Skates and "a series of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The beloved Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity yet.
And there's another crazy-looking plot that is involved in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always are the excursions of the best part of the franchise.
It is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's underlifted by "Singles", whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old kid.
There are the moments of random contentions that might accompany this franchise as a kind of continuous "Seven Up!" series until he achieves what I accept as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the band how they will visit the movie premiums of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon reminds us of another type of Nostalgia: the resurgence of the Cold War of "The Americas" on the film "Atomic Blonde" and even on "Glow" with its East-West Ringcomptic iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas as director, is a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighth year with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism Leninism.
The main controls - a hard-cut Gregor and an idealistic Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Ulici, whose dialogues by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized in English.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gangs to look at (the police spend time watching chess on television, how Americans may do it with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides for an important game 'Find out the voices'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the reality of a questionable propaganda drama - a killer wearing a reaction mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.
In six long episodes it is there, and the comedy is not fast enough or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was edited for a shorter time, could deliver his agitprop satires better, since Gregor and Josef are always visiting the American message, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men who separate a bunch of Hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary Communist public is that Western culture can make everything for a living.
The fictional Romanian Creators did not lie: We do it even with our own younger history and with their own.
Strikes against drug mafia in the country
The police have been attacked by the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in Schwarzwald-Bar-Creis, Rottweil, Kontweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as reported by the Konstanz State Department on Friday.
In this case, 15 accused were arrested between 25 and 77 years of age and have already been given court orders against them.
In addition, officials secured more amounts of marijuana and cocaine, shell weapons and several hundred thousand euros.
At the same time, two persons were arrested in Italy.
There was a German court order against the two suspected Italians.
The two are likely to be transferred to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, over 300 police officers were in use.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, and robbery and oppression.
Since summer 2016, the state administration has been finding Constance against organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
Between the state authorities in Constantz and Palermo there was a strong exchange and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
This is why, on Wednesday morning, four officials from Palermo were also accompanied.
In this regard, Italian nationals in particular referred to the Italian Mafia as a visitor to the survey.
A case also occurred on May 27, in Häfingen, where several shots were fired in a guesthouse early in the morning, had to go to the band's account.
How to make big mistakes in the foreign register
"Data of citizens who should not be raised there": A report shows significant shortcomings in the foreign register in Germany.
This leads to some serious decision-making in asylum procedures.
The Federal Government’s Refugee Management Officer, Frank-Jürgen Way, has then made a media report on major gaps in the foreign central register.
Lacks of data recorded there could lead to "partly serious decision-making" on asylum procedures and disposals, cautioned in an analysis of the "South German newspaper".
The register includes 10 million people with foreign nationality, of which about 5.7 million are from non-EU countries.
The data are then managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
As the data have not been sufficiently provided, the data quality in parts has not yet been good.
In individual cases his data from 1921 was found "by people who are no longer alive or by citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually be raised in the register".
"Inadmissive data inputs can greatly discourage return processes," says the report.
The statistics on people with travel obligations show that EU citizens who have not even had to travel.
However, such misdelegations led to "a distorted debate on the treatment of travel officials", which is why the analysis.
Under this, the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy once they were expelled from there.
The "New Osnabrück newspaper" reports on the move from an internal paper of the Federal Bureau for Migration and Refugees (BAMF).
In the paper, therefore, the BAMF is leading such procedures "as regards families with children - with the exception of girls and young children - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was virtually impossible, so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation in front of the place.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees in the EU are responsible for their first arrival.
If a migrant is moving to another EU country, this State can send him back to the country of entry.
For reasons, the office now writes: "In the meantime, the capacity for families with minor children has increased significantly in Italy".
Italy has issued a guarantee for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (EGMR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The internal political speaker of the left-of-the-art group, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Familys with children are suffering from the lack of human rights conditions in the Italian asylum system and a risk of child welfare".
Double Best Result
In total 220 litres of blood from people living in Overreigenbach, the blood donation service was already available to other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were honored on Friday.
All before Jürgen Greule, who shared between 100 and 50 litres of blood.
Traditionally, at the meeting of the Community Council, the Community should be prepared to donate blood several times.
"It's great how our body is designed for it and we will respect the donors who make their blood available for foreigners, or even useless," stressed Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood contribution helps more people," explained the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, who is being transferred to their spare parts.
That's how three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions carried out in Overreibach in the spring.
"In this year, we achieved the second outcome with 114 donors," said the DRC cruiser.
Apparently, the change in the theatre has led to higher participation rates a few years ago.
Previously, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiphase donors and were awarded 50 blood donations for each.
Half of all Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger spend every 500 millilitres of their lifetime at the time of Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stephanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter.
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0,25 %
The Bank of England is expected to be informed later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the decline in inflation have caused speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "increased" when it maintains interest rates on family income in a growing pressure.
The Bank's Monetary Committee's policy decision makers (MPC) agreed with 6 to 2 to maintain interest rates at 0.25 %, with fewer members trying to increase this month, as the weak economic growth has weakened its support for an increase.
In its four-year inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast by 1.7% for 2017 and by 1.6% for 2018 and warned that the pressure on budget income would continue, with inflation likely to increase by less than 3%.
But she pointed out that interest increases would be needed in the next few years in order to increase the inflation generated by Brexit and said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mummy Conjuncture Package issued one year after Brexit.
It will require time for the funding plan to provide more cheap financial resources for banks from February, although it has been said that it is now expected that it will be made available more than 15 billion dollars under this system - with 115 billion dollars Sterling.
After the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (BIP) remains short-term weak as the pressure on household income continues to impose on consumption."
In terms of interest rates, she repeated that "a certain punishment of monetary policy" would be necessary for the recovery of inflation and a "something bigger" than the markets expected.
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would "progressively" and "limited".
According to the Bank's adjusted growth projections for this year and next year, 1.9% and 1.7% are compared to those predicted in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast by 1.8% in 2018.
The money fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The money fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision does not change after the latest drop in growth rates have fueled the rising expectations and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% has increased to 0.3% in the previous three months.
The growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be easily recovered after the bank at the end of the year.
The most recent inflation report is little enthusiasm for households that are affected by increasing inflation and low increases in income, as the deterioration is getting worse before it gets better.
It added that in the coming years monetary policy can't "stop income" but it added that the benefits will be "great" at the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the growing demand for British goods, which is to return to the low-cost, which will compensate for part of the lower consumption expenditure.
A year after the interest rate fell by 0.25 % in last August, the decision was adopted after the EU's shock-making agreement which caused the decrease in the fund.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until the prices and the economy are fully achieved.
Prior to the bank's last ruling on interest rates, the call was increased after a interest rate increase as inflation increased pressure on heavy household holdings, with three political decision-makers demanding an increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation has decreased by 2.9 % in June last month to 2.6 %, although the bank said that this was expected and it will be redrawn in the coming months.
The Bank said that the overwriting in relation to its target of 2 % would be "genz" to write the low money.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline of the swap councils, the mortgage market should become more competitive as the creditors seek sound business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who run existing deals and end up with new mortgages, and many with free tax options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular."
NHS (National Health Service) to write HIV drugs to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September following a conflict before the High Court against financing the drug in NHS.
NHS England reported that an appropriate pre-exposure profile (PREP) that may reduce the risk of infection in high risk patients by around 86 per cent is now provided by the health service over a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He stated that he was willing to finance the process after the Court of Appeal had confirmed a court of the Supreme Court last year, so the NHS had the power to pay for the PREP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The shock announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Chief Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) referred to it as "distinct moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to be able to register people and further clinics will be followed in October before it is introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Preexposure propylaxe (PREP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infected patients.
PrEP before taking sex means that just enough medicines are available in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or every two hours before sex.
Those involved in treatment include weak or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Appropriate participants are identified in clinics who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not internationally controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered at home can also be enrolled for a possible participation in their local sexual clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the supply of medicinal products this week after an international competitive acquisition.
The study should assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical sites, how it is used, taken and implemented to a large extent.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should end and overcome the growing and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the progress of more than three decades in addressing one of mankind's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
PREP, when targeted at people in need and in danger, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.
We welcome this announcement with all our heart."
Ian Green, President of Terrence Higgin's Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study be conducted quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be released.
Now that the PrEP test has been developed, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of Shadows, said: "The start of the pre-EP process is welcome and timely by the government after months of delay and fiscal implementation.
The evidence shows how transformive this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt gives us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP.
It is now important that this study be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society'.
The big life: Between shoes and smart designer tricks these small Earls Court apartment has turned into a large house
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, moved from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is in the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and there is evidence for the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high decks.
I have loved her and made an offer on that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet of large apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally, a single room presence with a bright layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add a cup of tea and a cup of tea to make the most of the large ceiling height.
"I wanted high roofs, big window, lots of light.
That was my request," she says.
For this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which used 12.5 feet high decks and created a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The deck was not large enough to place two rooms together so that the architectural challenge was to create an interlocking gap in which one could stand.
He had to think creatively in order to solve the standard.
"The steel work is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together without having to book us.
It was not only about building a simple platform but about building the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full order - with a lot of additional drama.
For the cross section, a classic cup light window of retrouvius looks down on the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is exposed to make it work longer.
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, the mirrored units offer space for all the containers and glasses of Joanne.
By taking a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Combustible kitchens are nothing new.
Especially is this that it is about a garage.
"A little engineering art went in here," explains Erfan from the reinforced, supplied MDF door.
"It's very important, so when you lift the door, it's very easy to drive."
Thanks to the clever use of space and store, Joanne was able to win additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form an real estate broker will be entered and a calculation based on the floor size is carried out."
Here they have made it possible to enlarge the surface and at the same time use high-quality materials that provide space with its luxurious advantages.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," Erfan says.
"You don't love yourself in the electrical stickers in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that a apartment can be transformed by good design and an increase in the number of square meters of something standard in something completely amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers fight for a 500 million US dollars real estate empire
Two brothers are four decades old, after their Italian family founded the Dynasty, in an auction for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than 500 million dollars.
The former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis live in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. This led him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to share their property and business assets.
Paul had already wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp change in the divorce is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers owned 38 properties in value of more than half a billion dollars, since 1973 the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 individual businesses.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the city.
After an agreement with her deceased father Colin - by Paul as "the chief operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - is described as about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul is about one third.
One court said that this means that Colin owns $116 million and Paul owns $176 million.
The distribution of property and money has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought best for the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.
On the last Friday, after several separate statements, the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are also fighting to control the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claimed, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but Paul proposes to manage some possessions in an incompatibility.
In an early Affidavit, introduced by Colin, he says he hopes to contribute to the conflict.
"My Italian heritage predicts that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs are higher in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloittes, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading legal lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicate businesses from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property, opening up the first Jeansladen of the family in Colin.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he "was in my last year of high school when Paul was a young child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give their property to their children.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to come to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, where Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark, says Paul "has become confused about the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin has been very supportive, although he was a former AFL member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire of the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by texting to say "I can't really say much," because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to accuse me and to bring our family names to justice," he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote to the court that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father didn't want Paul and I to end our current conflict," he said, adding that he "always hoped for a solution."
On Friday it seemed to be too late.
"Our affairs will be resolved in the near future by the courts," Colin wrote.
The new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the media absence of the President.
Others have tried it and have been separated.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new Head of the White House plans to restrict information flows to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the head on a more balanced course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new head of the White House, met with leading employees on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps Weißem House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that was delivered into the hands of the President.
Kelly told the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in letters - because the President would make better decisions if he had good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to catch a trap by monitoring his media incident.
President Trump's relationship to television has been back for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television is still strong.
"When candidate Trump was discouraged because of a lack of reporting capacity, it was productive to show him that he received a fair report of positions to be convinced," said former electoral adviser Sam Nunberg against Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election officials, is to ensure that its personal media consumption includes a steady prize."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump Twitter habit was always "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know about others - that Trump Tweets had contained more sinisters without their intervention.
We'll probably never learn something about the tweets that the trumpet hasn't sent.
If his employees had already made it a few times to keep their guards away from him, their efforts have been rewarded.
But no one has been able to prevent it consistently that Trump raises objections.
Part of the problem is that people in a white house, composed of competitive parties, are constantly trying to introduce their own agenda by presenting Trump material, which may promote their views from the world.
Politico - fully occupied with this story - reported in May on the desire of the councillor to provide the Presidents with suspicious information on strategic grounds.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmaker:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially such with harmful leukemia, and that he is confused about where they come from.
That is exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone falsely accused the President of having a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the internet prosecutor Charles C. Johnson, who accused the head of headquarters Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a building of Lakes" in the White House.
Although Johnson was constantly banned from Twitter because of his skiings or that he has not provided any concrete evidence or that he has exposed false claims in the past and rejected them.
Trump read the article and began to ask his colleagues about Walsh."
Goldmaker added that the former Chief of Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper frame that gets the trumpet".
How'd it go?
Kelly's trying to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself to be a more effective manager than a Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted offenders receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the people's help will be requested and expected.
The police throughout Europe send in this summer (virtually) poster cards to dangerous criminals on the flight.
Since the addresses of the sought perpetrators are not known according to their nature, references from the population are expected and requested.
Europol reported on Friday on the action followed by the "EU Most Wanted" Advent Calendar by winter.
Experiences have shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, it has taken place since Europol.
There are 21 postcards for sought offenders from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 the website www.eumoswanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online interviews were established so far, at least 11 of them due to post-publications on the website.
Travelers negotiate a grave and return to 'Millions'
Some of the most prosperous owners of the West Midlands are also with some determined travelers on foot who have dealt with one of the graves taken from the Community to request a field before their master's houses.
The passengers have parked their 20 cars on a field outside a well-being street of Solihull, called the "Millions series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were released in May only, but without being fired by a dignitaries seized by the Council to prevent their attacks.
The active group found a hole in the defense facilities and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unstoppable to find a way.
The Council of Solihull, which said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They were taken there on the Montaga evening after being sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passengers.
The Council must be forced by shame to implement it, since it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The passengers were there in May, they were moved forward and are now back.
More came last night, probably even more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks.
I live on the streetbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my Community tax if the Council can't stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be named said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be pulverized by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park."
A speaker from the Solihull Council said: "We are an unauthorized camp in the country outside the streetbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls. We take the necessary legal steps to move them as quickly as possible.
It is very important that as many people as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This contributes to creating an image of the situation in which the court has to examine if we present our case."
From Birkenhof will be Waldhotel Luise
From the old hotel Birkenhof will be the Waldhotel Luise.
The house before the gates of Freudundstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened next year on 1 March.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Birkenhof Hotel by the immediate environment operating company mbH on April 13, 2014, about 30,000 nights per year were lost and also revenue by the Kurtax.
In autumn 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in the number of refugees who came into the countryside, the hotel building was offered to Landrasamt as a meeting place, which provided for controversial discussions.
The city prevented the introduction of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
At the time, the decision was not inconsistencies in the Council.
However, especially the mayor of the city of Freudenstadt, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and had already spoken with serious interest in the house.
He should keep his right.
The group of Luidenhotels with business leader Birgit Schererer with seating in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Birkenhof Hotel in Berlin on a voluntary increase and wants to make it a house of the Three-Star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the happy city.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisen Park, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and if you enter the house, it will be clear what extensive renovation work will be undertaken.
The floors were excavated, roofed to part, old bathrooms removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
There's still much to do by March.
"It's really a beautiful hotel," says Thomas Schererer in a conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be restored in blackwall style.
The rooms are equipped with large comfortable showeres, the entrance area is refurbished, and new windows are built.
Everything should be "good citizen" later on, as Thomas Scherer says.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are included in the equipment.
You don't want to put yourself at the high level of the hotels in Louterbad, but you're already at an elevated inner city level, stressing Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to be set up wide, reveals further.
Both individual holidayers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and Director of Tourism Michael Krause have already been conducted, as a matter of fact.
The city's performances are similar to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
According to the level of investments, Thomas Schererer does not want to establish himself exactly.
Almost a million euros, he calculated.
The external facilities are also brought to frontman, which is already clearly visible.
In an inner courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freud City is a good market".
Russia-Affaire: US-Specials set Grand Jury in
In Russia's case for US President Donald Trump, Special Agent Robert Mueller is to use a so-called Grand jury after a report.
The Gremium took up the work last week, wrote the Wall Street Journal on people who were trusted in the matter.
The newspaper valued the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his findings.
The transmitter CNN reported that it had already given the first presentations of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. Secret Services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time, aimed at joining the 2016 presidential election.
Mueller examined whether there were discussions between the Trumps electoral team and Moscow.
In the light of the findings, several men who acted as the councillor of the Republican in the election are to be held.
According to reports Mueller also took more and more Trumps private and business environments under the ceiling.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special medium Trump had personally returned to the centre and examined whether the president might have prevented justice in the course of the case.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to check the evidence available in possible cases of crime and decide whether a complaint is to be filed.
This is why Grand Jurys is also called the prosecutor's chamber.
They are usually enabled when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The Gremium can also be activated by the government administration to preload persons to be arrested under AIDS.
According to the CNN sender, proposals have already been issued which are about the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
The report said that those who participated in the meeting were invited to make a statement.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's consultant and Swiss son, Jared Kushner, as well as his former president of the election, Paul Manafort, were also interviewed.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the U.S. television that the application showed that Mueller didn't let himself fit in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary.
However, it must not be forced to say that the Grand jury will finally be activated to decide on the prosecution.
However, the introduction of the Gremium of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new enthusiasts, the President used a speech in West Virginia to represent Russia's business as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The history of Russia is a total invention," said Trump.
The topic gives the Democrats an opportunity to "feel very good because they have nothing else to talk about".
His Special Adviser Ty Cobb stated in an opinion that he knew nothing about the use of a Grand jury.
But these work is usually also in secret, he stressed.
The White House feared any measures that would speed up the work of the Special Representative in a "freally" way.
The former head of the FBI, James Comey, has three times said that he will not be investigated against the presidents.
There is no reason to accept that there has been a change in this, it went on in the statement.
But Mueller was used only after Trump Comey burned.
As a result of this riot, opposition to Trump was heard, he wanted to prevent justice.
In June a Senate committee said that Trump had asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After showing US media, the White House collected material against the special mediator and his staff.
The most common speculative speculative is whether Trump Mueller wants to release.
Unlike an independent congressman like Richard Nixon in the Watergate case, Mueller has a position in which he could be theoretically burned at the pressure of the President of the Ministry of Justice.
Several senators of both parties, however, want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented legislative proposals on Thursday that could no longer be left so easily by the Special Ombudsman.
Antarctica: Giant Eisberg runs in Antarctica
In the West Bank, a giant iceberg has been dissolved by the almost seven-fold size of Berlin from the Schelfeis.
This was shared by the Bremerhaven Alfred Weegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The more than one billion tons of heavy and 5800 square miles [5800 sq km] of large colossus now runs north and may take two or three years until it is broken.
It is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded in the past three decades.
A danger for people doesn't go away from him.
As far as the climate change has played a role in the destruction of the Eisberg, it is unclear after research.
However, for some 30 years now, there has been a series of unusual outbreaks of ice cream in the region, the U.S. Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a fact-finding background.
According to many researchers, this could be associated with global warming.
The now detached Colosseum has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is eaten by large glaciers.
So it keeps growing into the sea and starts out on a regular basis.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located almost south of South America on the tip of the Antarctica peninsula.
In the north of this sculpture was the balance of growth and interruptions several years ago.
A complete sculpture has fallen there, writes AWI-Forscher Daniela Jansen.
It is a matter of fact that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger too, because the front edge has never been as far back as it is now.
In addition, the ice disk is under stress and can fall if a piece is broken at a key position.
The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level, as it swims on the water and ice drains as much water as it does after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the scarf leads to the fact that the glaciers can go directly into the sea and fly much faster than before.
This could increase the sea level, but to a lesser extent only, the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen-C scale is the fourth largest diameter of the Antarctica with nearly 50,000 square kilometers.
It is up to 700 metres thick, on the front of the free ocean, about 200 meters.
That's where it starts regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the iceshield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"This is the longest return since the beginning of the registrations," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it was argued whether Larsen-C-Schelfeis would now grow again or go back in time and possibly collapse together, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say it will be less stable".
But this development will last for decades.
Even if these researchers do not bring the destruction of this giant iceberg into the climate change, in the past decades there have been very many ice creams of the Antarctica peninsula.
This long line of Antarctica extends to South America.
According to data from the British Antarctica Survey research programme, the ice area of the Antarctica peninsula has been around 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The temperature increase has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctica peninsula has heated around three degrees in the last 50 years and is therefore the most rapidly increasing area.
CDU wants a personal account
Since it is becoming increasingly difficult to have free jobs, the CDU asks to remove the employee link to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, 41 new positions in the administration were completed on Wednesday.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the circuit administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainers have their first day of work behind them.
The teachers in the circle are obviously very interested.
About 620 applications were to be registered for the places to be given this year.
However, the circle still needs staff to be able to handle the increased requirements and tasks.
There are currently more than 50 jobs not occupied by Mettmann.
They are sought among other doctors and engineers as well as the forces of the general administration.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG on Wednesday and address the lack of expertise in the administration.
The management is to "design a concept for staff gain and development", as the Parties wish.
The aim is not only to cover the short-term needs of professionals but also to counter the future trend of the tenderer's approach.
The overall concept should be based on internal and external orientations, concrete measures for cross-border trainees and a training subject should be required by CDU, FDP and UWG.
This is already after a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities buy good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The talk is from a regular "competitive competition of public workers".
There is a high number of employees who are separated from the service by illness or old age.
So the maximum time to deal is to stop jobs from being unemployed.
However, Klaus-Dieter Peoples, head of the CDU Group, still goes beyond the common application with his party.
He was not long ago concerned about a sudden surprise on the cruise when he asked the public about the cost reduction and the rest of the parties were exaggerating.
Peoples want to examine all the possibilities that allow an Austria from the municipal association of workers.
"If we don't come here for a satisfactory solution soon, the circuit administration should seek a haven with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities -," said the Peoples.
This is why the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than it does for the public service.
The holders are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money are available only if you change to a higher level that focuses on years of employment.
However, the work of the circle has grown increasingly over the years.
Just a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees had to take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.
Not recently by the increasing number of asylum seekers Landrate Thomas Hendele and Creed Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few personnel.
Italy strengthens the sound of NGO migrants' rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs to use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue this unless they adhere to new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can work on it," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minnitis warned one day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German Aid Organisation 'Young Redett' because their crew had effectively worked with human trafficking in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has been in operation for the first time in a year, refused to issue detailed proposals from the Italian state attorney Ambrogio Cartosio.
"It is for us and the salvation of human life remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in an opinion to the social media.
"We can assess all the allegations that are currently being raised, only after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat from 'Young Redett', the Euventa since October.
It is suspected that its crew takes ship-ship migrants on board which are delivered directly by human dealers and that the Schmugglers can take off so that ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles ahead of the Libyan coast, according to the Act of the State Health Act, which was published by Italian media.
The occupation is suspected of being based on the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue facilities in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the Code of Conduct ships such as the Euventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board who oversees their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue installations have so far been prepared to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable because they would not bring with them "real changes or obstacles" to their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize winner organisation is a doctor without borders (MSF).
Minniti said, however, that the number of migrants who had arrived after the rescue measures in Italy had been very much back in recent weeks, which meant that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal guard and to cooperate with local mayors had borne fruit.
"In the last days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He made plans for further discussions with Libyan Mayors this month on economic development initiatives and to reach Europe with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants left behind.
Upstairs and Trials
Nine Weiler Biker, the "Berliner External Posts" and two guests met in Wachenheim in the North Pfalz to enjoy long trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Watchtower Hall proved to be a good starting point for the tour.
The bourgeois and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome addition.
The first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelscathele above Deedesheim.
It followed points of view, partly on towers, from which you could look far over the forest and the proposed levels.
Meanwhile, there were still longer increases which were rewarded for the long trials.
On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim for the Salin and the People's Party Wurstmarkt.
Once again, the view point was selected, connected by "floating" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days many heights have been added.
Hobbies, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shopping rooms brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers enter the glorious sun in the holiday hall.
Newstadt has also been notified.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 altitudes, the group had been familiar with the Pfälzer forest from its best side - sports and cultural -.
Console instead of Rasen - Bundesliga is equipped for e-Sport
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of fighting heavily with wind and weather over the stadium terraces?
The fact is: E-Sport has long become a serious industry, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high-speed.
This has also been recognized by the first federal legislators who are increasingly engaged in this area.
At the beginning of 2015, VfL Wolfsburg, later followed the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, founded an e-Sport department in mid-July and took two professions for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to encourage all new young target groups for VfB," said President Jochen Rötgermann.
He's sure "that there's still a number of units up on this train".
The next week, the football World Federation FIFA in London organises the first "Interactive Club World Cup", where the players of different clubs meet each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-German or the PSV Endhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Liverkusen and Werder Bremen offers an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football needs to be inter alia with the 14 to 30 years of age that young people still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The associations are trying to overcome all possible markets, especially Asian ones.
With prominent e-sporters under contract, one could be more often present on these markets than only once a year to send the Federal Federation to Asia.
What exactly's going on?
Computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "counterstreke" or "FIFA football simulation are awarded to competition.
Long ago, as in normal sport, lies were established in which the professions appeared against each other.
And in the 2022 Asian Games, e-Sport is already part of the official program.
But it's actually a good sport?
For many, it is necessary to make sure that the presentation is made.
Ingo Froböse has also been involved in the issue for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports High School in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
There is also a need for cognitive abilities, technical and tactical understanding and rapid response ability.
Professional players should not only train their bodies but also take care of their food.
"The fat player is a good player."
But the problem is also: "Doping will become more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of the classic sport were missing.
The scientists have a positive effect on the high integration of e-sport.
Players are international route, which is like a large global family, since there are no intercultural barriers.
A study of corporate advice Deloitte and the Federal Interactive Maintenance Software (BIU) shows that e-sport is facing a rising growth.
In 2016, EUR 50 million were implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.
In three years, sales are to be between 130 million and 130 million.
Against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football league is too small.
However, whether the e-Sport is "no longer far from the other established sports types such as handball, basketball or Eishockey", the Deloitte consultant writes.
International is still many countries.
Large markets are Asia and the United States where former basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez are participating in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood player Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport web provider Unikrn.
There are also some things in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, E-Sport has been introduced as a teacher, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, the football-Erstliga associations are obliged according to Dutt to set up an e-Sport department.
"In the European comparison, Germany later refers to Germany," VfB President Rötgermann said.
Just to fall into Nostalgia, and to explain the old times, it's not enough today.
It is therefore necessary to preserve the Union's tradition, but at the same time, the company should be adjusted to the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," says Dutt.
"You can't be sure that it's just like it's always been."
Gift-Eier ade - The Ei-Alternatives for Cooking and Baking
The scandal of married couples is affecting almost all the German countries.
Aldi South and Aldi Nord have responded and have taken all eggs from the sale from Germany.
Only eggs that do not contain fipronil should be taken into the rules.
Michelle Carter is condemned for the text that Conrad Roy uses to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will be sentenced to 15 months of trial behind bars and was sentenced to five years in prison.
Carter was sentenced in June to life on 13 July 2014 for the innocent murder of Conrad Roy.
Roy's father said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is amazing.
My son was my best friend."
Carter had to stay free until he was called.
She was faced with a 20-year-old maximum punishment, but her legal representative argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
In red holes and a cream-coloured blue, Carter stood there with tears in his eyes, with fallen hands and his eyes fixed down when she was sentenced.
"Your actions have taken Conrad Roy," the state attorney told the court.
"She ended her life to make her own best.
She has no responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any noise."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "crazy condition which she completely regretted".
However, Justice Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that her "age or reifegrad or even her mental illness has a significant influence on her actions".
A state attorney read a statement by Roys Mother Lynn Roy, who complained that "there is no day when I don't care about the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there, despite all my pain that we will bear forever with us, for his sisters," that is.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be "continuous" by the knowledge that she would never take part in her brother's wedding or be a aunt for her children.
"No longer to have this only person I've been with since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to demand another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy died of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case came to national attention after Carter's text messages indicated that he had encouraged him to finish his life.
"Get up, jump out of a building, start yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news that she had sent to him two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
At the moment before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Richter Moniz said that Carter sought attention through Roy's death and arranged that he should benefit from some press on the case.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
The few who defended Carter belonged to Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to death in 2007 by her British counterpart in Italy two years before she was released.
Ms. Knox, aged 30, published in Los Angeles Times a comment: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new FC Bayern mini-lam
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was supposed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no accident.
The FC Bayern won the Confed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation doesn't hurt there.
Something else was there at his place in the cabin that Joshua Kimmich saw right away, even though the additional clothing piece was very small.
But then far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups, of course, were neither Philipp Lahm nor Manuel Newer to see, he kept his assigned bond to him.
"The trainer hasn't announced it," said the Confed-Cup winner later, after his first use as the Bayern Captain.
Well, the state could have been better running than at 0:2 against the SSC Neapel.
But the sign of the coach could also say Kimmich.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was chosen as the director of the existing C-Elf profession from young players, supporters and just from the holiday.
Zuckerl is most likely to share it with those who are very confident that you want to stay at Launé.
So those who have been denied access to the inheritance of lahm can only make good use of a small extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old fled as a mini-laham across the field.
Right back, that's his position now, the white tie on his arm made her rest.
And at all, Kimmich worked in this initial formation as one who can get the miner the best.
He gave instructions, tried to link the unsuspected team.
He had the view for all, while many others were working with him.
Vidal so as to overplay his lack of fitness (cracked almost); Renato Sanches so that the devil can join the performances of the Asian journey (cracked even conditioned); and Sebastian Rudy and Nikla’s Süle so as not to be negative in their first performance in the Bayern trip.
It was always very good.
Soul loved next to Kimmich, Rudy rose before the turn, both of them acted so.
The newly occupied Napoli tower was often difficult, as well as the soul tried to make it a few times.
His colleague Rudy said that the result was "not the way we expected it."
But he also showed proper performance at Debut.
Game reduction, Temporal Change: "For this style I have been treated as well".
How unusual this Bayern world is still for the new arrivals, it was seen in connection with the party.
Rudy, for example, did not have one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich agreed to a few cutting statements in the background of his new player.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What goes on here I have already noticed.
At Bayern you just have to win every game."
He doesn't have to pay the new ones anymore.
Alaba motivated by ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ØFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer has recently reported on the game on Twitter and wants the women of ÖFB all good.
The Bayern legionary is almost a club college of the ØFB-Captain Schnaderbeck and celebrates with our Ladys.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and the Champion League winner should be a special motivational expression.
The famous Bayern Dussel may also need our ladies well.
Entrepreneurship satisfied with Reheinland-pfälzischem Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It was often thought inevitable that the relationship between the country and the regional economy, as Evelyn Lemke (Grüne), was still an economic minister of Rheinland-Pfalz.
This is more than a year after the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region are talking about a change in economic policy at the same time as the former Minister.
Frank Natus, President of the Association of Trier companies (VTU), says: "Wissing is responding to the wishes of the economy which has blocked everything."
Natus sees the greatest turnback in infrastructure policy: The exit of road 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now on the country's list of priorities.
This year the Ministry is still looking forward to a plan-setting procedure until 2021.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the West-Westhung Trier, who is in the forefront of the Federal Roadmap.
The aim is to take the route in December 2020, says Prime Minister Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees a way to support regional but international competing companies.
The Industrial and Commercial Chamber (IHK) Trier, as Wissing responded, aims to add a Rheinland-Pfalz label to increase the paragraph in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been declining for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open watch for people who want to build their own company, the IHK praises.
The workshop Trier sees an additional rise for young educators in the new Master Bonus, says business director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of EUR 1000 for the existing master test and EUR 2500 shall be provided if graduates make themselves independent within 10 years of master training.
However, the list of household tasks for the country remains long.
At the time of the planned road construction, there are rapid facts to create, while the country is lacking the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, chief business manager of the IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers who want to set up Wissing in the country's business mobility, up to 29 jobs are employed.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
The CDU Group View Christian Baldauf points to calculations by the Court of Auditors, the country invests in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the acquisition of national roads.
Frank Natus is also waiting for a country's concept of how to overcome the lack of expertise in the region.
In addition to the so-called wide-band construction in the country.
In 2016, regional companies assessed the network supply in an IHK survey only with note 3.4.
They complain about stocking Internet connections and interruptions.
At the same time, former Minister of Economy Evelyn Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in the Board of Supervisors of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke by April to become president of a private college in Karlsruhe - where they reopened the field after four months of disagreement.
Audi is going to change 850,000 Automotives - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would be offered to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that the company was of the opinion that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", and this involved European cities - including Munich, where BMW is present - to prohibit or restrict automobiles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would be modified to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as withdrawals.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of self-propelled vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxide that emits diesel engines is considered as carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers, installations to install the exhaust emissions emitted by self-propelled vehicles, also take into account what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of neglecting powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the errors of folk cars which could regulate the use of such cut-off devices which could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested, but are able to return under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees were accused of cars and others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former director of the thermodynamics was arrested in the development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zacheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought before the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in public cars after the Audi authorities accused him of installing a system to implement emission regulations in Europe and an application focused on the United States was extended.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could be difficult for folk cars: the luxury car manufacturer contributes over-proportional to the benefit of folk cars.

Mordillos knollennas and the laugh against the suffering
Mordillo was once one of the most popular cartoon characters, the knots of his figures are his brands.
The Argentineian also draws 85 still and works on a film.
His message: Lachen, "for there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he fought, among other things, as a painter for glycwynskach maps - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he ended up in the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stars" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artist of cities was always able to breathe again.
Large, round Mordillo figures are wrapped in drawings with the ship Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the red place in Moscow.
In the early morning, he is also sitting on his own data today, working almost ten hours a day.
Over the calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, pets and watches, its drool figures continue to find much spread around the world.
For six years he has also worked on a drawing film and a TV series with his figures.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos, the most popular animal in its drawings - which has a thousand fans as an opponent.
For the first time, his figures are speaking in the 3D film, which is due to come to the Kinolein wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're gonna say it's rare for me," says Mordillo.
The scroll is not written by him.
Therefore, he prefers to focus on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without word.
Levendel from the Provence of Climate Change
He has become a symbol of the Provence in South France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is recognizable because of the conditions surrounding the door and the diseases that transfer insects, what scientists and farmers try to find solutions, prepares great headaches.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "The Lavender in the Provence has been effectively threatened because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the life span of Lavendel.
There is also a small zigzade, a microbacterium that transmits vertebrates, and there are very many of them in very dry weather."
And it's a lot on the game.
Lavender oil is not only used for holidays, it is also very requested for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant nuts with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and both missing or weakened.
So we have less parts with essential oil."
The solutions taken into consideration include a better distribution of water and the delay in depletion from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of tone and water and the development of species that are resistant to dryness.
The city of Geisa in the Thuring Rhône celebrates its 1200-year-old existence.
Festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a mid-term party.
Kremmers, fives, dealers, vagantes or a national nursery are supposed to be in the city these days.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the Riodoce weekly meet normally on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in Sinaloa State by organized crime, corrupt officials and unauthorized drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
It was announced to them that it was important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they are going to take their children to the office who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009 or let them go home.
Security experts wrote three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, connected.
Please propose to the reporters names for each column - no evidence is required, sufficient perceptions and feelings of smell.
There are drug dealers, politicians, business people, journalists who are suspected of being on the government's list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who are threatening Mexico's chaos.
There is no break from violence, and throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto's office in December 2012, 589 have been following attacks and threats under federal protection and there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.
Among the latter is her publisher and inspiration of Riodace, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence in relation to drugs.
His shortcomings will be deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "justice", depends on the fascade of the Riodace building. Two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts who show his funny face with glasses or his typical Panamaout.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although a special federal administration was established in 2010 to process the cases of journalists, it has introduced only two criminal procedures to protect journalists.
As in most of the thousands of murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought before court.
At Riodoce they still have to deal with the violence of Sinaloa, although they are surprising and although the land is even more treacherous.
Without information about the killer, without justice, the meeting on security has little benefit, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we're all lost."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital city of Culiacan.
He only created a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River".
The guard went into his car and hurt it in the vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two grown children.
Smells to fly to Culiacan for free.
But on the subject of Valdez there is virtually nothing like wet.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, where rival groups fight here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't seem that in Sinaloa someone or more people will be shot on the street every day or that the peace hall is full of deserted, double-sized bridges for drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living.
Remember for a minute that there is a state of "Rhohe" if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodace, was guilty of breaking up his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartels in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have enriched the children, suspected gang members bought each copy of the edition as soon as it was delivered to newspaper skiers.
The second error was not to force Valdez to leave the country to its own safety after the death of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his execution will be seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues admitted that he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he sold himself with five colleagues to build Riodace and 50 US dollars.
In Sinaloa, "it's impossible to operate journalism without getting on the issue of abortion," Bojorquez said.
In time, the newspaper deserved a call for courageous and honest reporting, and the sales and advertising took place.
Reporters liked to be able to publish hard investigations without fear before Zensur, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else could handle.
Eight years after Riodace was founded, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for her report in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for His Courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, where it always led.
He volunteered that he was afraid.
"I want to live," he said at the time of the CPJ.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life", he said last October in an interview with Rompevinto TV.
"They must take over the task that happens to you as a journalist - either that or you play the drums.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what happened?"
The Riodace team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could fly like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trust his routine.
He'd always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar against the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for Routine his ruin?
His death has also forced her to question her own views on how to best accomplish her work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you're dealing with their wives, their children, their clean business, their secret start and land roads," to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-interest and self-sustainment.
Trust his own instincts.
If it's wrong, stay away from it.
The priest is, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said, "Use a sense that can be changed... and then the matter is handled with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer applicable in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of luxury jewellery routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the area where Riodoce's employees met for security training, no phones were immediately allowed. Days before it was announced that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two police officers were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were commissioned by the Government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle class district of Culiacan.
In half of the day, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who were designated by the Governor himself as untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountain country where the drug gangs de facto are under control.
For the issue of this week, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exhibition on state spending that focused on the Governor's home city.
And there was a group that carried out an execution in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the state court office.
There was no official word about who was executed or how it happened, so it was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knew that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter reports from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling institutional Revolution Party (PRI), who ruled almost all political levels throughout the century.
Several PRI governments were recently charged with high-level cases of corruption.
Villarreal told the reporter to write about previous events in this place, one of which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman experienced a military disaster.
Only a few months earlier, the readers had viewed the column of Valdez as the best-known source of the release.
"We had already known what happened before," said Villarreal, 46, with the name "El Flaco" because of his slender body structure.
"Now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."
Valdez's office was converted into a storage room for characters and dressers who protesting against the murder of journalists because the employees have become something they had never expected of themselves: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez interrupted a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the government office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, it's his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more louder by writing "SOS Press" on threats and buildings in organised protests.
On this day, Director Bojorquez is away from Washington and is trying to gather international support for justice in Valdez.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying out journalists and of letting them go because they had told the truth.
She has since prayed that she will be re-shared by the government because she is concerned that her forest has damaged her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "given" by organised crime, by government officials involved and by an equal society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that not only are reporters killed by drug gangs but also on orders from politicians and security forces involved in organized crime under cover.
The Media Watch Group "Article 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on police journalists and officials last year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez.
Apparently, the murder has a shocking effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas Charter: "I am here because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were located next to their detached head.
Some branches have chosen to close as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do what El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after her director was murdered in 2004.
In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartel with a leading article on the title page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are chased, as it appears to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered three months after the flight from Veracruz in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City.
For those who stay and continue their work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who wanted to be closer, says the drug dealer's gonna scare him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
For midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was finished, editors of Riodoce went to the city hall before the office and drank beer when they started to sum up all their phones.
A series of shootings with banding rivals and security forces near the Badeorte Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.
The war further escalated how it was promised through a series of cartel messages in the region.
They published the news on Riodace's website on the phone from the board.
The title had to be changed the next day.
Sirene kept up close - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police officers who were watching to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they wouldn't show it.
Under the powerful portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle finger was visible for the whole Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his footsteps.
"How can you just stop thinking about it," Bojorquez said, "when the same day that Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send her to report on the street."
Dynosarium used to wipe out its enemies
At the first glance it looks like a statue, even an amazing one.
Researchers have now found that the first findings of an incredible Nashorn of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It was so well felt that they could even determine that his dirty skin was of red brown - and they said she had something of a "unfeeling past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" referred to him as "the best preserved dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
Fossil is a new species of nodosauri who lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible well-being has been described by researchers who describe it as "real value"
According to reports in National Geographic, the planned plant feeder is the most obtained fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was found at Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He found something that seemed missing from the surrounding stone, and decided to look more precisely.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paléontology.
They spent the next six years trying to detect a severe earthquake within 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg).
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be understood.
"If you were to blink with your eyes just a little bit, you could almost believe it had slept," said the main author named Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creation is to be seen.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and most obtained dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant freshener, although covered with a mixture and similar to a changing panzer, was likely threatened by meat-frequency dinosaurs.
The heavily armed dinosaur used a red and white tanning to hide from predators and used a drawing technique known as opposite taxation, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed better mixing into its environment and removing its enemies, experts say what it means to be threatened by greater dinosaurs.
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosauri family has made its first slaughter line in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Boraleopelta Markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours on it to discover it carefully.
The amazing maintenance of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of shoes and ornaments about his body.
They discovered the concentration radiation, an extensive method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the tops of creation were darker than their subside.
Although the concentration estimates are common, the results are surprising, since the size of Boraleopelta is far greater than the number of animals alive today.
It points out that the dinosaur was driven by sufficient pressure by meat-producing dinosaurs, that Evolution benefited from the breakdown of the confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use concentration radiation - think of ranks, zebras or mammals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than bees, which indicates that this nodosaurus was a real fight for survival.
"Starke's raptier behaviour on a massive, heavily panicked dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur raptures of the circle time must be," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for reference to its life, including its preserved darmin content, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was thrown into a river and moved into the sea, where he fell on his back to the sea base.
At this time Alberta was as hot as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much more abroad than they are today.
"This nodosauri is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved artificial skin, but is also kept in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost exactly today as in the early Christmas season.
You don't need a lot of imagination to rebuild it. If you just had a little eye with your eyes, you could almost believe he was asleep."
The creed time was a time, like huge tropical, flimsy dinosaurs that stood on two legs that crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, who lived millions of years after Boralelopelta, was defeated by some of his horrorful practices.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.
Scientists, whose latest findings appear in the current biology magazine, believe that Boreelopelta was delayed after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.
The creation was found by Shawn Funk when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved dinosaur of the world, including skin and clothing, and is completely from the snow to the hills.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It consisted of two 20-thousand-long tops that were cut from its shoulders.
Researchers believe that the planned plant feeder was drowned by western Canada until an overflew stream flowed into the open sea.
But the underwater supply of the dinosaur kept its equipment in excellent detail.
The sealed remnants of this special sample are so well received that the hair strains still cover smooth panzer plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, it is such a level of maintenance as rarely as a winning in Lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it is.
Dried remains of the skin still cover the woody panzer plates that bear the damage of the animal.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are stretched up above.
I can count the shoes on his shoulder.
In the white: mass carolage on A8: Many injuries
A8: Button 30 vehicles are developed into a mass caracology.
There are numerous damages, km-long staus and gaffes.
On the highway Stuttgart-München (A8), about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass caralog.
According to the police's first statement at 17.00 hours between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a winter of nearly 30 vehicles, including probably also cargo cars, were intertwined.
At first, no information was provided about the exact number of the injured.
It's about mild to moderate injuries, said a police speaker.
A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of the journey, Munich was about ten kilometers long back.
As an AZ reporter reports, there have also been massive obstacles on the road - by many gates.
The fire weapon noted the signs of vehicle links that now have to be counted with sensitive punishments.
Shortly after 18:45, another accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car carrier and a Pkw.
A rescue officer was on the way to the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group testing "Comfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: Nothing without being in the train and sleeping.
Or one is deeply involved in his work and just has a brilliant thought.
And then: puff.
The chauffeur comes and wakes up a mess or lifts the driver's gas from the working river.
Control of driving licences.
But the time of interruptions is soon over.
The German Train is currently testing the wireless driving card control.
You can simply confirm by phone that you take your place and convert the road map.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"The offer comes, let's go.
It will then be likely to start next year on many other road routes in Germany," said one train speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train's rating without Schaffner.
However, some conditions must be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which, however, most passengers already do.
It must also be about the app of the train that has bought the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You get up in the train, call your driving card under "My Tickets".
Then a button for electronic analysis appears in the test customers.
The trainers will receive a notification on their mobile devices that the driver X is in the train and has taken the registered seat Y.
If the trainer comes to the road map control at Y, he knows there's a passenger with an online ticket already on hand.
So you can sleep more, work more and more.
The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the train - which is to use the passengers again.
"If you want to travel without ticket controls by our train crew, check in the DB Navigator simply.
This allows the passengers to make their travel time more personal," says Michael Peterson, DB's marketing director.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to meet individual customer needs."
Those who drive often know that in addition to delays and lost trains, driving card controls are among the greatest concerns.
Because you often have yourself, but in any case one of the suspects does not need all the details that you need to review online tickets.
Either the credit card or the staffing method or another document you need to provide is missing.
The consequences are endless discussions between trainers and drivers, leading to a bad mood in the department or large room and delays in controlling their own ticket and taking time at the end to take care of other items.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And it's also on the links ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stutttgart-food.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet activated.
How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shot up to her core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, she was born in St. Louis on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and ran through Facebook on her phone.
She was proud of a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," he said.
Disturbing that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed her Facebook and opened a Twitter.
A user with the trade @TheePharoah has been constantly on her timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was killed by Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lebble body that was stretched on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She left her phone to go back to tweets later that night about people on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who screamed, and by a man who claimed to be Brown's father who took a picture with the inscription: "Fergus's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a live feed where a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a striking dog.
In another video, she said, assured another policeman of his threat and wrote, "I'll kill you all animals."
"That's not normal," Ferrell reminded himself of her statement.
"That's not the kind of murder we've been used to and we can usually call it."
At this point, I felt a chill.
I was angry and angry."
She rented a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 hours, she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would travel to Ferguson next morning.
What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas since 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, the strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of people living in the Community and filled the streets to ask for answers.
As Ferrell and her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, went to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before this morning 'over the black experience and the black condition'.
"You remember how I taught you when black people had to fight for it, where did they believe?" she recalled what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her with me," said Ferrell later.
"What's happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
You need to know it and see it and be drawn into it.
It must be well developed, not only as an activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I am lucky to give you an experience in which she does not personally experience eclective racism, she is no different than the next black woman's child.
I feel like I'd show you a bad service to keep them away from it."
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was located on the South Florissant Road, a place against the police authorities who became a camp area when activists were waiting for the possible non-appropriate charges of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter contacted a local business owner who made dinners.
They offer bags and help to pass them on to demonstrators.
In the long run, a new kind of activity for Ferrell began to take place.
"My activity changed after August 9th," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all here."
A week later Ferrell met during a evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farar just wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell in the sense "Would you document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This creature was eaten by countless cases of people, often by white - in a community that benefited from its pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently said in an interview: "We have heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson have not focused their voices and we wanted to do otherwise."
Folayan had already collaborated with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activity around death-trafficking insects.
Ferrell's commitment brought the project closer, along with six other locals, followed the team of "Who Streets?" in the years following Brown's explosion.
"This documentary film is not anyone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We're talking," said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are shown, because I'm going to be shown."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that it was "not to be a Messiah leader, but to be a community that would come together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whoe Streets" show amazing personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she loves herself and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that there must be some vulnerability to this work and to the humanisation of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's history replays the role of black educated women in the wider black-lives-Mutter movement.
Two of the three reasons for the movement, which, after the death of the black teenager, Trayvon Martin in 2012, presented the film "BlacklivesMutter" in social media, are identified as a school.
"Black, weak women in leadership positions have brought the movement together," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, weak women must bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement will really be maintained by black women and many black women".
However, it is that "this is not a confirmatory type of action", because of its identity as the heart of the film.
"She was the person who raised this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, though she was on the front front, because in a life at these crossings as a black, weak woman is so much on the game.
You can smell their energy through the screen."
The news cameras in Ferguson have been gone for a long time, but the racial ties between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on the ground for 211⁄2 years due to the blockade of a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the social policy atmosphere of the area she calls her home "A Chaos".
However, she smiles at a song and feels committed to this memory since she was on the street three years ago in Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "Trium" to "Size Car": TV readers discuss bit-galerie
The bit gallery moves people even though it hasn't been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping center in the south of the pedestrian zone has been spreading the population in fear and opposition since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold doesn't leave the subject alone.
The topic will also be discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While they say "It would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "It would be a real class" (Nicole Schausten), it comes from the other side: "No man" (Siggi Betten) or completely evil: "The big car!" (Lars Scholz).
While the sponsors build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, from which the other businesses also benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then explode.
In addition, the gallery is located on the ground floor where the farm market is located and offers its products in the 13 direct markets.
At the beginning of the construction work, it will be concluded.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and although to the Beda square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Room: "We've been shopping for many years almost weekly in the Farm Market.
In general, our eggs, but also the tasteful kitchens of rural women are still very much appreciated.
We've also discovered the meeting arrangements for us.
We would also like to have an opportunity to receive this offer directly during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
There are other cities too.
In particular, the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "If the direct market is located in a market hall in the gallery, the amount of rent will rise.
The new project must not be very low."
Eva Kilic: "What shopping mall in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugs or supermarkets: I find the excess.
There's already enough of this in our town.
You see how many cargo business are empty here - sometimes for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is so important that at least we get the market hall.
Because the product offered there is always fresh, most of it is offered directly by the manufacturer and is above price.
As you can see, cargo shops are rented in a shopping center only by larger companies because the rentals there are often impossible for a individual dealer.
Unfortunately, special business is almost gone and what's left of it is probably going to disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping center with a market hall does not fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg.
First of all: Where should the farm market hall go during the construction?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even for a long time if the bit-gallery ever comes.
Or is it possible for the Bit-Gallery to sell all the business out of Bitburg before?"
George Marquet: "It's just not going to work.
And a shopping center that's empty doesn't need anyone.
In my view it would have been better to promote a fair agricultural market rather than this gallery.
But for a farm market hall, there is no place in Bitburg any more - as I find - meaningful construction projects.
When the farm market hall is captured, a piece of culture will disappear again."
Appropriate Similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces – white, black and brown – which are almost identical – that hang on cables from the deck.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts sent to you by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the sections from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former Secret Service Analyst spent a 35-year prison sentence after making secret diplomatic announcements about the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition opened on 2 August is A Coming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transtrooper and a leading dissident whose condemnation of Barack Obama was changed when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone could look with these genetic data, even though some intellectual comment is not only about the complexity of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determination of these interpretations - but also about identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but since her puberty has spoken openly about identification as a woman, was convicted of 20 complaints, including six violations of spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison her picture was crushed, so much so that there was only one photo - a curious, black-white selfie in which Manning was apparently sitting still on a driver's seat and wearing a flat-blown pearl - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of its 2012 project 'Stringer Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of foreigners from such forensic artifacts as cigarettes and caucagummi by extracting DNA from waste to make an image of how these people might look.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg said in a press review of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at this time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artists and their captured museums were different letter friends who replaced several letters over the course of two years.
They even create a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicts a future in which President Chelsea would turn judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama would require the release of Mannings after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas just a few days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender groups to find new, two-way ways to detect the star columns that he should actually restrain.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the same timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning asked for its superior signature (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end to "automatic breakdown which has been based on sex, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousands of sensors from Cs and Gs and As, written in bleistift.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by involving 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people are expected to do is that our name doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how they are subjective," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so it's 30 of these stories."
The last item in the exhibition, which is stored in a private room, is a page from the comic novels mentioned above.
It shows Manning how she grew up with a free phone from the U.S. disciplinary cassettes like King-King.
"When they call your words, they win," it says.
"So never hold your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I'll still get skin skin when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if she should do it, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulators, which combine themselves like horns of protestors.
This was also aimed at how everything in the exhibition came up to the size (5 "2" 2 Mannings Station), where their genetic haplo groups were written with bleistif.
"In the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted her to feel like a lot of people," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portrait.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that came after her release."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University sought for murder
A country-wide manjagd is currently in charge of a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who is sought for suspects after a man was shot in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) Prison orders for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown by the acts of the Cook County Court.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several strokes.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July.
Officials received a call, came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still reported at the site of the case for death, and detectives were investigating the strike as a murder while the police were actively looking for the two suspects, said officials.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now allowed and excluded from the campus of the Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the competent authorities and the Northwest University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasure Assistant at Oxford University.
A speaker from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help the US intelligence authorities in any way that we think."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them strengthen them," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities helped to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the construction manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a straight tip, who said that something happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very funny.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the event took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the population: "The police are currently working on the time and background of the victim and researching a number of motives, including a possible domestic event."
"We're going to finish the WADA driving plan in the near future" - the Russian Vizepremier Mutko
The Russian Vizepremier Vitaly Mutko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"In a particular stage of meeting the criteria of the driving plan, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA driving plan was updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA driving plan on compliance with the code that described the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, he does not include anything that could give rise to concern for Russia.
"All has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-Doping authorities must publicly accept the results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian Legal Officer Richard McLaren on alleged state-supported doping in Russian sport.
In this regard Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-Doping system has made an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programmes, and we won't give anything that doesn't exist."
Mutkos' words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In a discussion with the Russian sales site RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-Doping organisations, adding: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains conflicting positions and regulations.
No one has proposed to accept this report unconditionally," adds Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 by the WADA from the implementation of Doping Controls in Russia in the course of the Doping scandal.
However, you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be used again.
Already sold no more eggs
This was shared by the companies groups.
It is a clear precautionary measure which could no longer be removed from the health threat, it was included in the communication.
Only eggs should be supplied to Aldi from now on, which must have been tested negatively on fipronil-containing anti-drugs.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency in his customers.

Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your employees at your e-Commerce start-up, but the questions did not work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or even worse.
And even if you promise anonymousity, some workers do not fail the process.
"It was simply never consistent and objective," said Errett, who operated the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.
She's called people from outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensed software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee's commitment, it allows companies to carry out interviews, to contact specific groups and demographic groups, to offer employees anonymousity and complaints hotlines, and in some cases to allow them to use C-Suite driving forces and directly to the Management Board.
"They now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for the pursuit of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software Analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees' commitment.
Correct said that she had a better view of what your employees think and feel with glint in the three years.
In addition to snap questions and questions from certain teams, there is a hit map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which driving forces show low approval results - so that you can approach why.
Entrepreneurships must remain at the top of the job culture so that you will not become the next Uber developed in scandal since a former employee has published a blog post describing a range of injuries that those who spoke have been punished.
For startup-ups like Glint, this desire is, after all, a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, following the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Converter, helps the company to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uberfall in miscredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has just signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send moderated "Puls-" queries, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the hot cards of your problem rooms.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows the employee to report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Board of Supervisors.
"The Court of Public Opinion has taken note of the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and business director of Converter.
If a company is found to be ill-treated or unethical by its employees, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Converter for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have an easy opportunity to reach their business centres.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company centre, file a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often a shock and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Council, who said there was no good way to track complaints from employees.
Now, as the company uses the Converter, problems that are previously identified and addressed by leadership forces in offices in cities or countries can be identified and addressed more quickly, such as discrimination, injury or unsubstantiated practices.
"I can get closer to this whole, 360-grade view in the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethical, values and employee engagement seriously in 2002, after the bookkeeping firm Arthur Andersen said that because of ethical damage caused by the Enron scandal.
But it took until the "Social Media came to their right" that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty washing went online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge companies with repeated fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity to find the consent of Venture Capital Investors who have both started-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and contributed his entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are almost surprising in view of the networked nature of companies, culture and Venture Capital.
There is a growing complexity of research that shows that today's employees from their jobs are more expected than ever.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high content and interesting projects are only used.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you do, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employment Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convertert and Glint.
Employees achieve income when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are employed and engaged.
If the Analytics tools third promises to increase commitment and use of employees, it is not surprising that you will find support.
The data on the employee's commitment to work culture are important to the experts.
However, the data are useless if the manager of a company has not taken any measures.
In fact, if a company asks a employee for your feedback, there may be an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, this frustration can slow down and demotize employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, the company that has seen too much data collection.
"For if you are not followed by employees ask themselves, "Have you really heard me?
Are you worried about that?
And who don't care why should I?"
Madison Reed, who is currently conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated staff, she was able to reorganise several teams within the company and add communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new views about employees, and it hopes that in the long term this will lead to a better binding of workers in a sector known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the browns
It goes at 23 hours when a number of UCLA football players are held on one side of the team's new field of exercise on the campus.
Some have removed their tricoto parts and show back full white from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team these unusual minutes are a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center next morning at 6:30 p.m.
"That's a real deal for the boys in the next three days," said Brian's coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became a Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players and has actually extended their days - at least until the end of Friday.
Therefore, the first three UCLA trainings should start at 19:15 p.m. to correct the time plans of the players already packed.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruns set the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six games in Westwood.
They will be held during August 18 exercises. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their mission against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supported the change in the NCAA even if it added another point to the multi-job route of the players.
"We put this huge burden on them for three or four days, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they've just gone through it, they're crying out again, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which, in view of the clear views of its fields of an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the hilled class, which has already been rented with footballes, will not be an easy task in view of the clear view of its fields.
Bruins players should own the hotel this weekend, but Mora realized that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We're going to use our security," said Mora.
"That's a real problem, and it's not long to think that people rent a room there and then set themselves up there to record a exercise.
If you have the video band of a practice, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces at Park 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
That's why I'm not worried about everything.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify actual verification in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to fact-checkers from third countries and then show their results under the original contribution, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to fight so-called Fake News.
In an opinion on its website, the company said that it would start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and send them to actual verifiers, which could be shown the results of the fact-testing from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for Fake News, many of whom believe that they have influenced US presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, where the French voters in the pre-election elections in May were moved by false stories, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they are not able to finish hate-filled posts such as before the elections in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in Germany that a test of the new facts will be started in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to the knowledge that stories from third parties are presented by fact reviewers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook News in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "linked article" and work on other changes in its message feed to reduce misinformation.
Create a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In his younger years, the little Scottney Castle was seen in a ski music video and was a dream star for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scottney has lived for 700 years in a turbulent history of his comfortable seat at the Bewl River Tal in Kent and has now become an inspiration to a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophazard Yorkshireman with a love for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says gently.
"What for a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotland. Each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotionally.
"I have only responded to the pressure of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jakobs," he says.
"That's his pressure!
And letters always flow for smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.
For someone who lived 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself were in it.
Oh, I love Archive!"
For someone who has been so hit by old papers that he is supported by National Trust and Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have a little overestimated") this seems to be beautiful to be true.
Rhodes used his days to explore the Victorian "new" lock to review the archive and to study the many treasures and curiosities of the lock, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He traveled through the land and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with farmers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his books.
Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and began writing."
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown as the National Trust gained full access only in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees started just to care for the archive, which he described as "hundred of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, it's on the roof floor."
Journalists, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps showing who said: "You might think that conflicts would be slow," says Rhodes, "but there was a Birke to fight the two families.
Boy, let's go all his way!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as the starting point to exchange more widely in English history, including 'The Laborer', followed by a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the construction of 1381.
"There is a record of a resurrection that appears in the closing of 1380 in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The farm revolt began in this area and I thought that a resurrection was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit father who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English reform.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which Schmuggler Arthur Darrell is depicted from the 18th century, who insinuated his own conviction by filling a sarg with stones (a discovery which was made years later when his sarg was excavated).
The Darrells are the Rhodes'Lieblings family of Scottney: "The Lords seemed to be a nice guy, always making debts and spending money for things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying wealthy old women - I suggest them to me as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to buy bonds."
After the end of its use in the lock, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He took a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämenmäki, the land of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was then restored by nature.
But Scottney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to be done with the fucking life again."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Marine Capelle in Rhöndorf
With the celebration of the 301-year-old Mariencapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday for the introduction of a new roof brand (round view of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team will keep the logo and the slogan secret about Nelson Artz.
At the end of August, the campaign will be held as a highlight of the campaign on the island of Gravenworth.
"To be nice to us.
Or," asked the action maker yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Kapelle.
"We don't think of it (of course!)," they write on their website released yesterday.
"But we use these measures to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems.
In fact, we are the firm conviction that we as Honnefer citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action involves more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
"It is appropriate to form an independent agreement, one that gives the city an irreplaceable unique feature."
Finally, they are in competition with other communities.
An average of five places can cost the city Bad Honnef its new roof brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Each year, August begins in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council (YAS) on pensions and transports in the official body.
So is this week.
At first glance, it was a normal process.
But there is nothing about Routine in the Turkish fighting forces one year after the Putch trial.
The meeting was no longer in the building of the General Staff, as before, but at the office of the Prime Minister.
The five Vice Premiers and the Ministers for Defence, Interior, Justice and Foreign Affairs participated in the consultations under the chairmanship of the Head of Government.
That's why the civilians in YAS were in the surplus.
The government is pulling the wheel in the military.
General Chief Hulusi Akar remains at the office, but the commanders of the army, the air force and the sea were suspended.
Since the split cup, the Head of State Erdogan has burned 169 of the 326 generals and Admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of visible connections to the movement of Exil Predictor Fethullah Gülen, who sees the Erdogan as the driver of the pontch test.
Against 486 people who should be directly involved in the poll trial are treated in Ankara this week.
Already the day after the Putsch, Erdogan had referred to the turnout as "good gift," as he had given him the opportunity to "cleanse the battle forces completely".
But does Erdogan really have the army in his grip?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the title "Infamous in the Military headquarters".
In the general table there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifest itself in the lifting of the military's head ban on soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
The major cleaning of the army and the security forces continues anyway.
In the middle of July, Erdogan fired 7395 state officials, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had captured the military.
The generals were older than the real lords of the country.
Three times they played their role as guardians of the World State Order.
After his election in 2002, Erdogan was forced back to the power of the military step forward, not least under the European Union's reform standards.
Former officials say that Erdogan is moving towards Islam in front of the fighting forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe" a non-known officer who, after the attempted terror from fear of persecution in the country of Asyl, warned that the Turkish army would be "full extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If that happens, such a development could not make Nato cold.
There is no doubt in the Alliance after the saubering of the Turkish army.
The leadership structures and operational skills are "weak", says Nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
He proposes to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a extended work permit and restrictions for family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft legislation should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the United States is issued to citizens from other countries of Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to plan routes for race boots
In the past months, there has always been a struggle over the future of the race club - now it's going to go very fast.
Even before the end of the year, it is to be built on the brown road on which the tourist road runs.
In order to ensure the long-term future of the train station, construction work should begin on the road, as indicated by the Ministry of Transport.
"By the decision to order and save the Ilmenau race further, the country is known for its important connection to tourism, particularly for tourism," stated the Secretary of State of Transport Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The costs for the implementation of the route amounted to about EUR 2.5 million.
Of this amount, 75 per cent of the country is taken over.
The contract on which the bullet is to be ordered also in the future of the country will now be finally agreed upon, declared soul.
The Ministry and the South Tyrian Railway as operators have already agreed on the technical details.
"This is how the vehicle plan that is used and the quality standards are dealt with," said soul.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of 11 years.
This is why the racestig-shuttle should be ordered regularly in December 2017.
The Rinnsteig-Shuttle is a popular railway connection between Ilmenau and Rinnsteig railway stations.
In the past few months, pilot operations have been tested whether the route of many people is used to order them regularly in the future.
The line is also very complex in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry.
Just when you thought it couldn't be reversed in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming.
Yeah, really.
Sex robots are currently a big deal.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus for robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founders of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the brush and the type of fingernail.
"People make fun of them, but companies deliver every amount of them, and we will see them more often," said Mr. Sharkey in his new report.
Modern sexpuppen have developed from their explosive partners to robots with a siliconhound that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust his robot" according to his beliefs and then choose everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the brush strings to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more disturbing because many robots possess the "personalities" that would gradually make a stepford-woman look.
Modern sex pumps have developed into robots with a silicone.
The RealBotix robot, for example, enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as covertness.
And then there are still the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Company with preprogrammed personalities such as "Freeid Farrah", which convey the impression of beauty and "Wild Wendy" with a " non-profit" personality.
"Roxxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible for your personality as possible," laments the website of True Company.
So they like what you like, and they don't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her voices in the course of the day - just like real people!
She can be dumb, be fixed on conversation, or she can be "in mood"!"
There are many exciting aspects of this rise in sex robots - not last because they replace real human relationships - but the underlying female qualities, the effects of rape, when you take a step on Fried (heavy here: against) Farrah, disturb one most.
On his website compares True Company Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have a roxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex game.
Their creation and their growing refinements point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a return from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional commitment.
Of course, most men do not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the edge of consumer culture.
But what comes through the ranges can be very instructive about the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not rare or deceptive until they are allowed to do so by the free market.
There is, however, a certain overlap between these highly developed sex robots at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, where there is a president in the White House who has said that women have been sexually attacked.
The most shocking aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') are not the graphic images, the broken bodies and the surprised eyes, but how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is a spring, but at the moment it does not feel like a great spring.
The aim behind these sex robots is to create physical similarity to real women as realistic as technically possible (even with pornostar ratios).
Her Maker wants her to feel human to follow the movement of a real body.
But when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply leave.
They have no media or background history, nothing that means independence or something that could ruin the imagination of total submission.
Other expressed: They are captive slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: Service girls
A great performance of Trumps?
He makes Mit Romney understand.
It has become a point of reference for the Trump-Ára that the political columns that polarize the US elections have also split families in small form.
Around Christmas and Easter, there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump.
We're all supposed to stick together to place our filter bubbles.
Less noticeable is the power to bring together families.
I am referring to this because my cousin, a left-wing witch who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, has visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect on a common enemy.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly and completely on the same side.
I am sure this is a good thing about lunch, but it seems to me in another context that this also poses significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the creative effect of his presidency has the power to expel us all to the right.
If we speak of "normalization" and trumpeting, we are referring to the enormous possibility that we will not be left out of the game of one day.
However, there is an even more alarming long-term scenario in which the right wing's right-wing Republicans "normalized" appear suddenly in comparison with its standards as an inconsistencies.
Today I find myself ordered by an active nostalgia for mid-Romany's urcomic version of the corrupt - the dog on the car roof, which is 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked) - both in comparison to Trump actually undergo a very mild punishment.
In the case of Trump, the next candidate of the Republicans must be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to Karussell in the Central Park, the largest carousels in the New York Park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need coffee.
The horses are huge, the Fiberglas designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are curious and the animals turn around to watch their own shoulders - especially windows and air-conditioning music convey this in a remarkable way.
So many clicks of a city: The views of high buildings will be old, the Skylines will be trusted to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not justify the dream.
Fifty-three years later, and I'm still not going all the way over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not actually Switzerland Cottage - the theme Pub Ye Old Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big circuit in northern London.
However, the Central Park Karussell is still a rare magical experience, since it can take two years, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40s and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the Karussell, I'd have given him the full number of points, but luckily no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced into a shopping house to assess my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% drink money - this to buy something over the ladentic.
This leads not only to a desire for what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also pressure on the server to introduce personality into a situation where no need exists.
The poor woman in the shopping house was terribly critical, while I used to have the experience to get my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison to hospital
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
In the past year, he was taken to the hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrists, which he subsequently carried out to the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was condemned for murder after an appeal by the state attorneys against a first coup d'état.
He killed stone camp in early mornings of the Valentine's Day 2013 by throwing it through a door of the bathroom in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he held his friend for a night's restout who hid himself in the cabin.
The state officials have announced their intention this time to punish the six-year prison sentences of Pistorius Appeal, from which they say they are too careful.
The National Criminal Court said that it would raise an appeal at the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs a risk that his punishment will be increased for 15 years if the state attorneys are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As a farmer Arnold finds a remarkable egg
As the last of the Blumbergers schools, the fourth classers from Füttes and Epfenhofen were released in the holidays and in the continuing schools.
Three of the graduates will go to Gymnasium in the future, four to the real school.
Schoolmaster Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biessental House in Epfenhofen on Sunday.
As a symbol of the school leave, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regina Meder, chose a young adult who grew up in the hut, but will be released into freedom.
In addition, the Monterey Schar led a musical titled "The Adler in the Hühnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a remarkable egg, and he let it grow out of his lungs.
Instead of a hunker-kick, a little Adler came out.
But the hope of making from him a cave came down, and the adler spread his wings over a high mountain.
Then the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a hühnertanz.
The dogs danced with the young Gockells who wore cylinders around the law.
The Adler stands for integration, said the school teacher Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (kikkins), but it belongs to them.
But he'll never be like a hero.
His determination is to be free.
She wanted every fourth grader to feel accepted in his new school.
It followed the words of thanks to colleagues, former schoolmaster Michael Müller, who was always running out of teaching courses, and the parents' representatives.
The kitchen time was now over, declared class lecturer Sophia Schumacher.
She leaves her students behind after two years only very young because it was a really great time.
Finally, they could have left themselves on the fourth class.
At the end, all the students were allowed to sing a song of summer time and holiday time.
This brought great joy to the children.
For the new school year, eight first-class students have already been enrolled.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal campsites in Greece, shared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television.
On the morning of August 1st, a group of people who were illegally rare were arrested by the police in Sitonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day they were released, while an investigation was under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have enforced control over the free camp and have imposed considerable financial penalties on anyone who is found to remain in a place which is not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court could impose a fine on money.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What the people concerned need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers in the review.
At Diesel Gipfel, BMW, Daimler, Opel and VW Group offered software updates for around 5.3 million cars.
They should improve the behaviour of cars in the Euro5 emission classes and partly Euro6.
Euro-4 shares or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe offers reviews:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the processed software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates are only applicable to vehicles that have spam software," says Anja Smetanin.
Its rotation has been organised by the Federal of Transport (KBA).
How and when are customers informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a slow implementation over the next few months, but have not yet mentioned a precise date.
Daimler has announced that he will register each person concerned.
If an inspection fails, it will be carried out within their framework.
How long should the gears go together?
"It's hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the manufacturer's commitment and political pressure.
"Because we have seen the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the issue of the environment so far."
How long should the update last?
The equipment itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get a term.
What do car drivers not drive by BMW, Daimler, Opel and VW Group?
The ACE is waiting.
It is possible that foreign producers would be attracted, such as Smetanin.
Is there a massive price decline in Euro-4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of this.
But also in the regions where driving bans take place.
In rural space there is no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE is still waiting for a sale.
LL Cool J gets Kennedy Center drawing
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award under President Trump is committed to becoming political.
One of the priests doesn't want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the desired awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year the singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the heroes.
The appointments will be submitted in early December.
Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will be held a reception and will share with his wife Melania in the delivery.
The well-known lecturer Lear, who became known for progressive TV series, had already announced that he would refuse to participate in the Gala.
The "New York Times" said: "This Presidency has decided to completely undermine the arts and human rights - even withdraw the funds - and this is a burden on me."
The 59-year-old Stefan stressed that she would use the talk with Trump to clarify her vision.
The Kennedy Centre, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the United States capital.
Meryl Street, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting are among the former prize winners.
We make the city worth living.
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, is going to rent next year.
The position has already been issued - suitable applicants are, however, rare.
For 31 years Wacker has been a city builder.
And the work continues to make him very happy, as he did in the press interview.
He reports about various but also demanding tasks that await his followers.
At the same time, he is surprised that until the application does not meet the requirement profile.
The city is looking for a architect or construction engineer at the next possible time.
So - taking into account the regular deadlines - there should be enough time for employment.
Since hasslach for the administration of the Community as a subsidiary building law authority, the applicant must provide the relevant conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city anyway.
If they could no longer meet these requirements, the citizens would have to travel to provide advice to Offenburg.
But citizens are close to the city and it is important to him, says Wacker, who reports from a good operating climate as well as good voting between authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years at the office, some significant projects have been collected that look back on the walker with steel.
"We make the city worth living," he's safe about the farm and his employees.
But also in the future, different projects are on the agenda: The design of the former Hukla area and the underground parking lot are about to stop.
The Kinzigbrück between Bollenbach and Steinach will be renewed, as well as the seasonal sanitation is still the subject.
Only the last one will be hit with about 1.5 million euros to book, "if we do it right," estimates Wacker.
"All in all are waiting for great tasks on my followers.
The work here is fun."
Sculptures are available for a city builder of a large playroom.
With haslach's own garden and garden, it can be responded to by many directly flexible.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green facilities will often be praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old city stands as an assembly under memory protection, it is important to "get an eye for what is clean" when new buildings are approved, the different city builder stressed.
Nevertheless, the city builder has a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "At last everything's running over my desk."
In the case of maintenance and coordination, he can count on long-term staff: Markus Neumaier (Huchbau) has been a manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains for a long time, Wacker wants to say: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify himself and stay."
Because continuity is important not only for a good operating environment but also for the further design of the city.
Those who want to acquire Roland Wacker should be able to present an completed study as a diplomat or Bachelor with expertise in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction law after the city of Haslach.
The city building is supported by high- and deep construction, construction planning, basic business matters, administration of the city's properties, city administration with building and city-based activities, as well as under the building law authorities, including memory protection.
Motorcycle fired on instructions: South-Westway stopped
According to the police, the unknown parents had driven the blue train from the railway traffic in the area of the Leobener Street (B116).
These were so badly damaged that the accompanying gear had to be maintained.
The investigators leave two male aunts and search for them from the hours of the night.
Close to the tatort, Witnesses were observed by a rosary roller and a bike driver.
"It goes far beyond a luusbubenstrice," said  ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch to the APA.
The father or the father had taken a great risk of his own and also of the traffic.
In addition to damage to the premises and facilities as well as the late minutes and costs for rail transport, railway customers could also have access to the roofs.
In total, being out of a "great" sum, the speaker said.
The damages were reimbursed on Friday, which could be carried on the road along the south road without obstacles.
Nearly ten persons were missing on Friday morning, two of which dealt with the road transport.
But they were late.
According to  ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of instruction had to be exchanged.
Insulators and masts were also injured.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD
Red meat and chocolate can sound like an alptraum for your cooling system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and milk products may improve the symptoms of patients with hypersensitivity symptoms.
The unstable state of approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cramps and bleeding, recurrent or bloody accidents, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those concerned are normally advised to breast-feed meat and milk products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerance of thirst.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that the immune cells in the chamber are patrolling to ensure that harmful microorganisms that hide themselves in the food do not interfere with the body.
Cells that are able to release excretion are made up of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without causing emotional tissue damage.
If the balance increases too far towards deceleration, this can result in a heart attack.
In experiments it was found that some kind of immune cells that promote tolerance were present in mice that carry a particular bacteria into their tissues.
And the bacteria need Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to solve the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the Darm microbiom and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a rich food to tryptophan encourage tolerance, less sensitive darmilium when the same system also works in humans.
The Post Doctor Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune system that encouraged tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribes, which were separately subjected, had not.
She doubted that the difference between the darm microbiomims of the mouse had been made - the community of bacteria, viruses and pills, which normally live in the Magen-Darm tract.
The mice ’ drums were sequenced DNA and six bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but they were missing in the mice.
Mouses were drawn into a sterile environment, so they lacked a darm microbium and did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuter and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, researchers L. reuteres grew into a fluid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to unrefined immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into the patient's cells.
When the active components were cleaned out of liquidity, it was considered an additional product of Tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 Milk acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the foot of the mouse, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan values were half, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerance cells as mice, and that most of us L. repeat themselves in our Magen-Darm tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan next product from L. repeats the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in humans with sensitious dermatitis.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control radiation on the inner surface of the drum.
Potentially, high tryptophanhan values at the present time by L. Reuters can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United with Nemanja Mattic has committed a "genie"
At Manchester United has signed a "genie" with Nemanja Mattic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the middle-class player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
The 40 million pounds of Chelsea's signature began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last preseason game, before the UEFA Super Cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and was impressed by the role of the holder, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira raced to love.
However, Mattic was excluded from the blues preparation Asian tour and only created 45 minutes that Mourinho gave him to improve before the beginning of the League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him get ready sooner than later."
In addition to Mattic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho started his XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent included in this week that Mourinho wanted three more new obligations, but he insisted that the club already had a " Fantastic Work" to meet three of its four previous new obligations.
"To get three out of four, I thank the Society," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four for me, but they've given me a lot of money."
Boeing "malt" dreamline in heaven
The US flight manufacturer Boeing has painted a dreamliner's sailboat in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in Washington, U.S.A., but started drawing in Marquette, Michigan, U.S.A., and headed in the form of a dreamliner over the United States, which is thousands of miles away.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens, the shape of a dreamliner was to be.
The whole thing was an exhilarating test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising before.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were created in the sky.
New Deep Attack for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
As the wind turns, however, as Sigmar Gabriel was still the head of SPD, social democratic ministers looked forward to elections with some concern to Berlin.
Not only fires from the party centre, but also no enemy from the feds - so the most important wish of the electoral campaigner was expressed.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, the fundamental change has been made.
Later, the staff from the Willy Brandt House saw the events in the SPD-led capital cities.
What was learned from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with wind.
It was deep beatings.
And one after the other.
The Bundes-CDU sees, after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, a general signal against SPD and Green coalitions.
"This shows once more: Red Green can't easily manage safely," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the German editing network (RND).
The surprising Group outflow of a Green Group has shaken the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the day-to-day election, his red-green coalition was lost to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Federation business leader Michael Kellner has called on the retired Dutch Greens officers every tweet to return their mandate.
The transfer to the CDU means a clear denial of the electoral will.
Every tweet must return its mandate immediately," said the Federal Business and Electoral Leader of the Greens to the Editation Network Germany (RND).
"That must not be true at all," says a SPD voter, when the new Jobs mission reached the party centre on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Niedersachsen, is present after the transfer of the Green MEPs to the CDU without any government majority.
It is the provisional height of a whole range of major and small crises in SPD-country associations.
And no one knows what's coming next.
The show started with the unexpected significant decline in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed the fans in their own time.
After the day-to-day elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That also became - and although everything was clearly worse.
The landing in Kiel brought the SPD into the Taumeln, which was held by Düsseldorf Plete.
The guys came up again in the weeks.
Then, when they had just created a new courage, the G-20-Gigifel came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next deep shot.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his Nimbus on the weekend because he went into Elbphilharmonie while burning his city.
And because he made so many mistakes in crisis communication that he made everything that you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now, too, Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW waste and its role in the Board of Supervisors, the Dutch Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time.
A man's ex-fraggerated came in.
Nevertheless, or perhaps just because, during the past weeks, Weil tried to put more emphasis on the band.
The aim of the former Mayor of Hanover to build his power in Berlin was also not to hide his friends in the area of Martin Schulz.
They gave him a guarantee because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could come in.
This is because there is no blame on the party's internal division of the Dutch Greens.
And I don't even know what to do.
As a result, the guys are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Her turn focuses on the Greens, and here, above all, on the rejected parliamentary majority.
"It is inexhaustible and democraticly harmful how Mrs. Twesten put her own career interests in the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, Head of the Party Links in the SPD-Bunded Day Group, the German Editation Network (RND).
Mrs Twesten is not elected on behalf of her person as a direct candidate, but on the list of Dutch Greens in Parliament, so the Dutch Members continue.
The logical consequence would be that she would return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Federal Group, regrets an "undemocratic manoeuvre".
"The electoral will was clear four years ago: People made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Dutch SPD as a top candidate in the federal election, the RND.
"Now, the personal career memory of a future CDU decomposes the election result," Oppermann continued.
He asked to explain the background.
I want to know whether it has been more or has given further commitments to the CDU Lowerachsen.
Credits to local banks III
Anyone who wants to rent a house in the years to come can first get support from the country.
In this connection, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG City Development on Wednesday in Empingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again took a look at the story.
Since 1991, it has been available in areas of sanitation.
At that time, in Sanitation Area I between 1991 and 2004, the country of Baden-Württemberg took up two thirds of the aid.
In the area of sanitation II from 2005 to 2016, the Committee was still 60 per cent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - it is ultimately important to promote internal development and not just to create new areas of construction.
On 4 April, you received information from the government Bureau Karlsruhe that there will be a sanitation area III.
The aid amount was EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 came from the country, the rest of which were received by the Community.
How does it create a sanitation area?
You'll then continue to investigate where the "real old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in cleaning up the planned area of interest.
If so, the area boundaries could also change again.
The STEGs were represented on Wednesday by Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gottzel.
Keller presented the contents of the Federal Country Programme "Social City" in which the sanitation would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the acquisition and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be subject to objective action, which means that they would be implemented by reason.
The area of sanitation would then be finally set up as a settlement.
The period of authorisation for the aid shall continue from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September of this year, the file collection would be carried out only once, in the framework of which the participants in the sanitary area receive a questionnaire to be completed.
In November or December, the adoption decision should be taken as soon as possible in order to begin with the vaccinations next year.
Pietzschmann further stated that each municipality must carry out the studies under way.
It is important to assess and decide when and to what extent urban misstatements are planned.
It will then also include a healing mark for the original piece.
Pietzschmann will even come back to emigrating and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gottzel stressed that an important success factor for the project was the involvement of the participants.
Therefore, questionnaires will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed until the end of the summer.
The yellow question book is the "building and basic books", which includes, inter alia, construction and sanitation purposes.
In the Green Question Book, the "House and Housing Book", information can be made about the size, distribution and population of a living room.
The blue business book is only to be filled when operating in business rooms.
However, it is worth noting that a full questionnaire is not an application for aid at the same time.
In addition, new measures are not beneficial.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the resources is working according to the "Windhundhprincip" - who comes first, first.
You can't reserve any benefits for later.
At the end, photos of the project "Ortskarken II" were shown to make the audience a "smackkhaft" sanitation.
British explorer sets himself a microchip to come home with a hand movement and car
A British explorer is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip to open his home, attend his office, and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the changed chip between dams and display fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an anaesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hunts, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology looks like a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northham also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a price of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is on the tax.
The advertising costs of the White House cost thousands of taxpayers
The decision of the White House to fly a marine helicopter to South Lawn for an event that presupposes American production in the last month costs taxpayers according to the information of the military who have left the TIME magazine up to $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heartpiece of the event on 17 July in the white house with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and Head of the White House took a walk through products from all 50 countries.
The Hubschruber produced in Connecticut was displayed next to a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fire-fighting car and a Mississippi-guller.
The White House's military office requested the presence of the Hubschwarper in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, almost 36 hours before the Hubschwer landed on the South Lawn, following the registration of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the Hubschwer.
"I just wanted you to know this because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of HMX-1 on the evening of his pre-eminent event, the former Marine Commander for Air Transport.
The message showed that the Hubschruber arrived at the South Lawn at about 15 o'clock in the morning on 17 July at 7 a.m. and stayed so long until the race was expanded between 18:00 and 21:00 this evening.
The note adds that if the flight from the White House should be delayed, a second crew should be required due to the limitation of hours of service.
The original flight crew shall be held during the event at the cabin crew, while the unit's security staff shall remain on the ground during the flight.
The records available to the team did not indicate whether a second flight crew was needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could damage the determination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're locked up," replied the Deputy Commander.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the President took an interest in the health reform reform that was under way in the Senate and promoted efforts to break the government's rules.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for political advantage is almost a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for travel.
But to require their use only for a photo-OP is unusual.
In February, Trump conducted an investigation by which the presidential aircraft provided its first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and its Twitter account is full of reports that claimed to be used by its predecessors.
"The White House is fascinated by the show "Made In America" - the products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often run training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to accommodate the US Presidents in the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was on the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercises in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event included the need to train the flight crew for the month, one official said.
Helicopter units also fly 11 hours this day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said that the taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other requirements presented at the event.
A speaker from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in putting the hopper on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not contain budget allocations for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to the U.S. Department of Budgetary Control for the financial year 2017, however, the DoD replacement rate for the VH-3D is $24.380 per flight hour.
Lists of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility home base in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the hopper are far below this rate.
"To determine the costs for the taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the refund rules is most unrecoverable," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rules for DoD do not include staff costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract closure.
At this time, the former press speaker of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the hopper for the event.
"The idea is to present this week things that are produced in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the United States of America are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I believe that hundreds of thousands, if not thousands of people, are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the hoodie and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
Of course it is appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump had interacted with the Hubschruber when he was walking over the South Lawn for the event, but he was sitting in the driver's seat of a fire weapon.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and complained to the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorksky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW News for more sensitive tasks
The second Tennis-Bundesliga's top ranger is at the tableside of the searchdorfer SV.
The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss will arrive at Kiel from 11 a.m. at the tableside Searchdorfer SV.
Despite five parties, the top leader of the second Tennis-Bundeslag has still had the sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent anyway.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a similar formation.
Just in the back positions I find the men very good."
In particular, for class and stability in the searchdorfer SV, imports from the high north are provided.
"These teeth and finds can even refer to applications in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double," Zay says with a look at Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Søren and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"That's always going to be hard for us.
Then you also need a good portion of happiness."
The new crew for the trip in the high north is practical.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
If it is not possible to create the current at the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella active French party, the Czech Liberal tournament will be the first to use Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) in this season.
The previously unaccompanied Chilean Hans Podlipnik Castillo was with the Russian white Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel at the Ball.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
Not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was the number one of the world's juniors in January 2016, someone from the trainers' tab on Marius Zay fills the frame.
How the U.S. can damage the OMV
In fact, Donald Trump did not act happily when he laid down his signature under the law for the annulment of the sanctions against Russia.
"In his passion to legislate the law," the Congress has packaged a few "constitutional regulations" here, he said.
The response from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was plagued by the US advance.
The draft proposes to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines in the EU.
Accordingly, both investors of the domestic OMV, co-financed with other European companies, are co-financed with the construction of the Russian North Stream 2 Baltic Sea Authority.
The throttle is violent.
However, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, so the official state of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself had to raise the sanctions by executive order for life.
Twelve weapons are his choice.
"The press" has looked at what the groups could change and what they could really wear.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar the Cali Cartel will be back at the centre of Netflix's speed
Despite the second staff of Narcos, which includes Pablo Escobars Killer, the series of Netflix is not yet over.
The staff of three and four were already confirmed by the Streaming Service, which first received their first trailer and showed the latest evil weights of the show.
With the third stage, the DEA has focused its attention on the wealthiest organization in the world's drug trade: the Cali cartel.
Guided by four powerful patents, they operate "as a Fortune-500 company" only with more government occupations and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) is in New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type that the American and Colombian criminal authorities invite to support the war against drugs.
More new players are Mattias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Wheelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third stage of Narcos will begin on 1 September.
Role back: The city offers 46 kitchen help
The city reorganises the Kita lunch table itself.
With firm contact partners for the children and a team assignment.
In the city's children's day, the clock will be returned.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld re-enters the food supply in the city's children's day-care facilities (Kitas).
For Sonja Pommeranz, Vice-President in Youth Help, this is a good news: "We are all very happy."
Cooking continues outside of the house: A caterer takes over this task and provides freshly cooked meals.
The city runs 46 children's day stations in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children receive a warm meal for lunch.
In the past year, every 2800 children are placed at the tables, and the need keeps growing.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week in the Kitai to lunch," Pommeranz explains.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour care if children stay up to 14 hours."
46 Part-time forces have since 1 September cooking service: they heat the delivered foods, finish them for salt, raw food and fruit, share the meal individually, give the food out, relax, spray and clean the kitchen.
"Employers are assigned a kite," Pommeranz says.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - determines the amount of time.
"The kitchen assistants are now part of the Kita team," Pommeranz says satisfied.
"So they are much more interconnected and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for catalytic guidance."
Because this is also why: healthy food and cooking.
"The children should help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team will be meaningful.
For the children too.
"They have a known power in the Kita, a person who trusts them, and does not constantly change people."
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the kitchen rooms - until then also the task of kitchen forces - will be carried out by special cleaning personnel in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has produced in comparison with the cost of its own government and foreign transfer for the city as the most economical one, is the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time forces are reinstated.
"But these hours are not as strong as in the area of education in about 750 people," says Sonja Pommeranz.
The Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of UNO mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, former Head of Mission of the United Nations, said that hundreds of women will be candidates at the Council elections in the provinces. Three women are candidates for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of the new registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible when women participate in the election process and are involved in all parts of the selection process.
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats against an electoral process that coincides with the transition from international combat negotiations to an advisory role.
In this year the elections will be given the power for the first time by a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will still strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan.

Men trying to expel 13-year-old girls
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to hire a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to information from the police, the men were talking to 13-year-olds who stayed with friends on the Kolping Street at 14.55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl's phone.
The 13-year-old, however, stopped praying and went on with her friends.
At the same time one of the aunts tried to catch the girl's phone and throat, however, which failed.
Without anything, the duo ran away.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is underway.
GMB management on investments in the McVie factory in Glasgow
A company wants to ensure that the long-term commitment to production in its work in Glasgow is ensured by the manager of the Biskuit-Manufacturer McVie.
GMB Scotland said the company had moved about the future of investments at Tollcross-Standard.
More than 500 employees work in the work, which is produced alongside other products Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse.
McVites owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million dollars in recent years.
He added that employees and trade representatives would "first experience" if they changed their activities.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland McVitie asked "remember that funding for modernising production lines will not be advanced".
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we can't get a clear understanding of the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce are concentrated on the local community and the large area of Glasgow, an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social participation.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and welfare, and in the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow requires a flowering production presence at McVitie".
A speaker from Pladis said: "The head of Tollcross's branch office received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with the staff that we, like all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, are constantly reviewing our business - and this is relevant for all our business areas and places - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than 5 million dollars in our Tollcross position, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a place of production. If our operations are to change place, employees and their trade representatives will be the first to experience this."
Did the PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga may interest Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not be left in the persecution of Neymar after giving a bid of £189 million to release its release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago about the world record collapse?
The sensory approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, as the League 1 club is ready to break the world record more than the duplicate of the previous brand, where Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for 89 million dollars in the last season.
After the end, Neymar will be awarded more than $500,000 per week for the world's most expensive player and the world's highest-paid professional athlete. PSG offers more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is aware of the way Neymar has forced his way abroad, although it is a source near the Catalan Presidency that the club has always given its best to care for him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG presidents in front of this view?
As Manchester City 2014 announced interest in the signature of Blaise Matudii, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any company that wanted to sign one of the best players from PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll stand up against them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to let one of our players sign with themselves, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have gone beyond this line, where the Spanish Association expressed its interest at the beginning of this summer in the PSG field player Marco Verratti.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the international people from Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona was able to track the consequences of this interest by losing a price for Neymar.
Inverted and damaged rollers
On the night of Friday on Saturday, an unknown mother turned a wheelchair set up in the King's field before the presence of number 30 and set it up to cover the vehicle with damages of over 200 euros.
The police Schramberg, phone 07422/27 01-0, asks for directions.
For an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leise, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because he had a car on his driveway, the driver of a VW Touran had to relax and touch the guide plan.
On Thursday evening the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW at 19.55 p.m. on the B 215 from Stolzenau was on the way to Leise.
In the area of the settlement of Stolzenau, a pkw came against him on his way, so he had to move right.
To this end, the touran drivers touched the lead planes.
The Pkw created damage.
The driver of the missing Pkw, a Mercedes Benz, had overrun an Lkw and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may be good that the Mercedes driver did not even notice the accident.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident and the driver of the vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Papst-Brüder Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuses by Pope Brother George Ratzinger.
This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspathen further provides for discussions.
Christian Weisnder, speaker of the reform movement "We are the Church", declared after publication against the German Press Agency, was expected by former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by Domkapell Master George Ratzinger, 93-year-old brother of the Emeritized Pope Benedict XVI., an apology.
It would be very useful if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep concern about their own excuses or their mistaken assessment of the past at the time.
However, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticised that the reporting of violence in the courts would be measured with "two measures".
With regard to the translation in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was "serious and shameful" action, which had to be punished and prevented in the future; however, it was the "grade of media manipulation", so author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
"The practice of identifying the Catholic Church as the source of all things is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public's opinion on keeping it normal," writes Scarofia.
Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bayerish Roundfunk: "You like to go to church and that's a found fresco".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth "Schools have been a very normal pedagogical means" "to be done with scared children like I was."
It was difficult to apply today’s standards to previous decades because the world has changed.
In connection with reports on abuses, Pope Brother George Ratzinger also often grew up.
In total, my author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the reminder band "My Brother of the Pope" (translated in 12 languages).
"I have to take Georg Ratzinger for protection," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he appreciated the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-page report submitted by the Justice Officer Ulrich Weber by Bistum Regensburg with the statement?
In total, 547 Regensburg courts were passed between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of rape, 67 courts were sexually abused.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, said: "In summary, therefore, it is possible to conclude that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been used by Domkapell Master R.
The punishment for the students was even more severe in the case of higher emotionality.
However, in contrast to many other accused, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even associated positive memories with him despite violence."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatten Georg Ratzinger's opinion was rejected.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on "Events of violence against protection orders at the Regensburger Domspatzen", gives a controversial picture of Domkapelllmeister George Ratzinger.
To a number of students, he has his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholera and a perfectionist who became handy when a domspatz musically did not perform a top performance.
How do you view this conclusion report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the money and read the entire 440-page long report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name George Ratzinger is at all.
He has just eight pages dedicated to him, and he is clearly free from any suspicion of coercion or consciousness in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence in the school also occurred outside its scope.
In any case, it may be proposed that he should be able to experience it later or that he should not have taken the first statements seriously.
The judgment-patzengymnasium, which he was working on, was found by practically all the questions as - so literally - "resolved", "heaven" and "better world".
The vast majority of his students, George Ratzinger, also presents a very excellent witness, describes him as "heathearted", "loved", "competent", "competent" and "discreet", as an extremely good teacher who regularly provided the boys with kitchens, boxes and bonuses and "always surrounded by children's beds".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to Wutauscruns.
That he did not only snout with ropes and hung the key band on the ground, but also spread his fists and went too fast to the hair or ears, he had already committed himself years ago, deeply repented and apologized for it.
However, in his honor it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the time of the question, the 1960s and the 1970s, in the case of parents and teachers.
Do you know such methods of training?
Of course, I think of all of us who were born before 1968.
I've also experienced this in a world school, a state gymnasium.
Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the intense sexual abuse and violence at school, it is free of baggage.
There is already a question as to whether it has to do with his reputation and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just been directed at him.
Yes, many who have never understood him are still eager to work on the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is: The report is delivered by George Ratzinger in any way!
In the media, much has been reported in connection with the report on the problem of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatten.
Will Georg Ratzinger also be responsible for any development or awareness about sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Not at all.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual abuse claims to have trusted the Domcapall Master.
Not even the parents were divorced.
"I've never trusted to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one concerned shopkeeper to the others, "It was very painful for me."
The real problem with the disclosure of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are weak.
If she does not even move her parents and siblings, then she does not necessarily appoint a leader who would have been a colleague of the aunts.
How do the Domspatzen-Schüller Ratzinger's role in the abuses?
Michael Hesemann: A student asked it this way: "About sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he had accurate knowledge (Georg Ratzinger) and could have kept the parents concerned.
I think it's... too absurd to accept that it's calculated for him ... well-known or clear or even more open lips than against their parents, international leaders, trust teachers etc.
What you're talking to him about sex... is incredible."
The report thus concludes with the clear result: "The fact that the students concerned in the field and/or their environment were affected by it could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free of any consciousness.
In this way, he cannot be called upon not to stop him or to bring him to the public.
Therefore, there is no reason to link his good names with this controversial crime, as it has happened in some cases.
In the media there was a lot of "Gewaltexesten" reading at the Regensburger Domspatten.
The former Domkapelm Master George Ratzinger is quoted in the "Wegsauen" report.
Does he have to live with this object?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that everything in the report was lost and mixed to a huge melga of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of George Ratzinger.
That is exactly what the report is all about.
There is a clear distinction: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of the courts, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, we say once again, other advocates.
In addition, the report deals with events since 1945, including those of four decades where George Ratzinger was not leader of the courts.
The whole horrible prégelpädagogic, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were regularly kicked out and maltreated, and under it, all happened at the Pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where they really had to control scandalous conditions.
But with them, Domkapell Master George Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he got the boys to face only when they were already at the domspatzengymnasium.
It was as the majority of witnesses pointed out, the theme "Pre-school" tabu.
You were just happy to get out of it and enjoy the much better treatment and even for many "paradise" conditions.
What else was on the domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to George Ratzinger, whose report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, despite violence, even positive memories with him".
The highest still remains the subject to be removed.
In spite of all efforts, however, the report was able to define only two periods in which he was informed by the authorities at the university.
The first time in 1970/71, when he just started to establish himself and started to attend a school where he was not active and responsible (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then only in 1993.
Close Georg Ratzinger in front of the stations is consistent with the ears?
Michael Hesemann: No, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which even reproduces the report.
In this context, he pointed out that "to continue to practice the prégel punishment in the school".
In view of the risk of negative press releases, he recommends urgent appeals.
It was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was a matter of course, as the punishments were banned in Bayern for a long time.
Therefore they took place in a legal garage, as each of us may yet know.
It was also difficult for him to appreciate where the affected may have exceeded or dramatized and where the acceptable limit was indeed exceeded.
But you can't say he'd always been gone.
That's just not true.
In 1980 the Prégel punishment for schools was also officially abolished in Bayern.
Fürstin Gloria von Thorn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s pedagogical measures at that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We are historians here talking about the "failure of Anachronism", so the risk of evaluating past according to today's moral standards.
That's where the Prince's right.
But of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was always
That's all terrible, and I'm glad it's finally done.
But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger for protection because all of this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, therefore, to draw swords and to hair and ears, were widely distributed in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then prohibited, he also took strict care of it.
What picture of his Regensburg time did George Ratzinger give to you in the conversation for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
What is the subject of early punishment in this regard?
Michael Hesemann: Now, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI., tells of his perspective, since the courts only played a neighboring role.
However, I do not deny any way that he was leading a strict regime there.
However, this must also be said once again: Without this perfectionism without the requirements of unconditional discipline, it would have been almost impossible for him to form an institution from the nationally-known Regensburg Domspathes, a world-class institution, a true European cultural heritage and its musical tradition, which went to Tournee twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and bonus only one makes no big song now and in front of any success, as in any area, but always discipline, patience and self - control.
As for a person, what happened to George Ratzinger during his conversations with her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and in addition, I have really got to know George Ratzinger very well and always again as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believing and devoted person, from whom one cannot imagine that he could do anything but a flight.
I get regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him as a member of his family.
Those who have not forgiven him until this day that he was strict toward them are thus clearly in the minority.
Most doms today are grateful to him for saving his life and bringing them to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, motherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that could be - but he was also a loving person to whom they still look today and whom they should respect.
And once again, it is quite clear: everything that you are trying to get him is methods of education that were then under the agenda.
We can be glad we've been over this time for a long time.
But it's the highest injustice, a man, just because he's prominent and has another more prominent brother to make a media Sinbot.
There's the bad idea behind it just too obvious.
Because the report that was just published is about to be published.
Now the state would be occupied by a 93-year-old man who has acquired great services and without the outside Bayerns and perhaps even Germany, perhaps no one would ever know about the Regensburg courts, finally in peace.
