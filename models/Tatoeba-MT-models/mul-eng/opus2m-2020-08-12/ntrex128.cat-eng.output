Members of the Galles assembly are worried that "they identify as Muppets"
Several members of the Assembly expressed their disappointment at the proposal to amend their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, a member of the French Parliament).
This politician has emerged from the plan to change the name of the Assembly by the Galician Parliament.
The members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure could become a cause of frustration.
A member of the Labour Party's assembly said his party was concerned about the fact that MWP "removed with Twp or Pwp".
For non-gallic readers: In galleys, twp means stupid and, pwp, extremism.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly commented that its party's set "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed various alternatives.
For his part, a Galal Conservative said that his group was "open" before the change of name, but he also commented that there is a very small difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in French is expressed in a similar way to the letter "u" in English in Yorkshire.
According to the assembly committee responsible for preparing the legal removal to introduce the names: "The final decision on any qualification to name the members of the assembly shall, of course, fall within their own members".
The Law of 2017 of the Government of Galâles gives the Assembly of Galâles all power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with a broad support for the proposal to change the name of the Assembly by the French Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee was deplored by "Galle Members" or "WPM", the "MWP" option was the one that received a wider support in public consultation.
It seems that the members of the assembly are suggesting different options, but the attempt to reach a consensus may entail a failure on the part of the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal deletion on the changes in the matter of weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as now standards on the disqualification of its members and the design of the Committee's system.
Members of the Assembly will hold the final vote on their nomination during the debate on legislation.
Macedonians will vote in referendum on the name change of their country
Citizens will choose Sunday whether they want to change their country's name for the "Northern Republic of Macedonia".
The popular consultation decided in an attempt to resolve a dispute that lasted decades with the country I saw Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has insisted for a very long time on the fact that the name of its North-Weapon represents a way to claim its territory and has repeatedly opposed its efforts to form part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, against the plebiscit on the change in name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those who are in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev now, believe that the change of name is just the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's campaigns stop singing: the difficulties of Harlem's churches
" Historically, the great people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," commented Mr. Adams.
"Today, don't leave it alone, both of you."
According to Adams, the disappearance of the bars can be understood.
"People have another way to socialize today," he says.
"The bars have already ceased to be that kind of living room for the neighbor where people went periodically."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets does not last as long as its leaders anticipate "and that later or later they return to where they came out."
The churches, he added, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condoms with the kind of people who will not be of any help to the temples remaining in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who understand condoms in these buildings will be of white race," he says, "and so what they will do will speed up the closure of all churches, since most people who are transferred to these condoms have become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white congregation, which existed in the early 1930 ’ s, had been formed.
A black congregation nearby acquired property from the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Governor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to retail merchants on the 125th street, one of Harlem's main trading streets, which are opposed to contracting or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when the lucky people of the Johnson River planned to rebuild it, it was then when they loaded the trailer.
Reverent David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's church, described the career as "the campaign of poor people".
The expert who made the chariot sound July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also observed that it was the world's first carroll that was played by a black race music, Dionysio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest carroll of the Church River 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been sounded at St. Martin's for the last few months, on the contrary, has been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them borne by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The council, the leading body of the parish, formed by lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July, expressing its concern that diocese "should be willing to transfer the costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the contracting the architects and contractors that diocese sent.
Some happy people have complained about lack of transparency on the part of diabetes.
A storm hits a 13-year-old boy while he's looking for lakes in California
A storm attacked and hit a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was in an investment to find lakes in California on the first day of the lake season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel explained to San Diego's KSWB-TV, he spent half an hour busing with friends on Sunday morning when he heard the cries of a boy asking for help. Then they stopped with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get him out of the water.
Hammel says that at first he thought he was happy to have caught a lagotha, but then he "discovered that he cried 'I've drowned!
I'm tired!'
He had all the tie," Hammel observed when he got to the boy.
"Because everyone came out of the water, I cried, 'There's a tube in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to the Lady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted into a hard state.
You don't know what kind of bull is responsible for the attack.
In a press tour, co-rapporteur Larry Giles commented that he had been working for weeks that a storm had been detected in the area, but that he decided that this species was not dangerous.
Gilles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
The authorities closed access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 turbo species in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sanisbury's plans, to the United Kingdom's beauty products market
Saninsbury's decided to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beautiful product passports in the style of large stores occupied with special employees.
These large corridors are only part of a considerable investment in the United Kingdom's beauty product market, a market that moves around 2800 million GBP and continues to grow while the fashion and land products sectors remain behind, and they will be tested at 11 shops throughout the country to expand to more stores the year it sees the test as a success.
The investment in beauty products is the product of the observatory of supermarkets in order to take advantage of the space in their previous performances for televisions, microwaves and land products.
Sanisbury's claims she will double her offer of beauty to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with areas of brands similar to those that can be found in shops like Boots now.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relaunching its Boutique makeup product range so that most products are now suitable for vegans, a aspect that is increasingly asked by younger consumers.
The retail chain The Fragrance Shop will also open concessions to two stores of Saninsbury's. The first did so last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, earlier this year.
Internet purchases and changing to a habit of buying food in smaller quantities per day to small supermarkets have made big supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Cope, executive director of Saninsbury's, stores will become more and more like big stores in an attempt at the chain of supermarkets to fight Aldi and Lidl account supermarkets with more services and non-food products.
Saninsbury's went on to introduce Argos sales points to many of its supermarkets, plus a number of habitat stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which, it comments, has served to slow down the sale of savings and increase the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt at the supermarket chain to chain its beauty and pharmaceutical departments resulted in a failure.
Saninsbury's performed a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended quickly by not agreeing on how to divide the benefits of the drug chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after sale three years ago by Sanisbury's from his business of 281 pharmaceuticals in Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for 125 million GBP.
According to Saninsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, since it will expand the range of brand brands of products for skin, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Saninsbury's, comments: "We have transformed the look of our beauty product corridors to improve the face-to-face environment for our customers.
We've invested in specific-format workers that will be of great help when offering advice.
Our brand range is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and we challenge the traditional way of understanding."
Peter Jones "frust" after Holly Willoughby's behind an 11 million GBP
Dragons' star De Peter Jones went "frust" after Holly Willoughby's television presentation was made behind an 11 million GBP deal with Jones' life-style brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to dedicate himself to the joint trade of land products and accessories Truly.
The trade of these two media characters had come to compare with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning used Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons star' Den Peter Jones enthusiast by withdrawing in the last minute of the joint life-style brand-making business to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him great benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was "frust" when the red star of the television admitted, during a Tuesday meeting held at his empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new bidder's agreement, with a value of $1.5 million, meant that it would no longer have time to dedicate to the common brand of land products and accessories Truly.
The deal had come to compare with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and hoped to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane to one of his vacation residences outside the United Kingdom.
According to one source, "Truly was far from Holly's main priority.
It was meant to be his long - term future and where we would see him for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to go back left without words all the parties involved.
No one could believe what happened this afternoon, we were so close to the launch...
Now there's a store full of shops at Marlow's center to be sold."
According to experts, this morning's showdown, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost millions to the company because of the important investment made in products, from coins and mirrors to clothes and clothes for the land, and from the possibility of delays for its launch.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and his husband, Dan Baldwin, had maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the president's office last March.
In addition, Jones has about 40% of the participants in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the program's I'm A Celebrate of ITV.
A source next to Jones commented last night that "We won't make any comments about his business."
Strong accusations... "and then we fell in love."
He laughed at the possible criticisms he received by the doctors to make a comment that some might consider "a little of a president" and to have a very positive opinion from the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump said, everything made noise out of the voice of a news reporter:
"I didn't give up on anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
However, negotiations towards denuclearization are slow.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho commented on Sunday to the leaders of the General Assembly of the United Nations that North Korea does not see a "responsibility" by the United States in its first disarmament initiatives.
However, he noted that the US continues to apply sanctions with a view to maintaining pressure.
Trump's point of view, however, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to declare war in North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now let's keep this big relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve Kim's relationship have had positive results: the end of the missile tests, help free hostages and return home from the rest of the American soldiers.
And he defended his little usual focus on relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this recent crowd, we'd have about 200," said Trump, pointing out the crowd that was before him.
A destroyed island and hundreds of deaths due to tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was said to non-governmental organizations in other countries that were not necessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had to be displaced, no national disaster had been declared, which was required to catalyse international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so that the situation is very demanding," said Mrs. Sumbong.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not certain that foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, manager of the national disaster agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies were allowed to contribute at the time of providing assistance.
Given the constant Sixties of Indonesia, the country continues to suffer from a little tragedy prepared for the anger of nature.
Although refuges have been built in Aceh in case of tsunamis, they are not common at other costs.
The apparent lack of siren alert in Palu in case of tsunamis, although there was a warning in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge number of islands of Indonesia is, in the best case, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was caught in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is now headed to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to arrive at the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo was a central element of his electoral campaign to improve the poor infrastructure of Indonesia, and he has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko's government faces the year it comes to the re-election of funding deficits.
Joko also faces the pressure of the permanent sectoral tensions in the country, where members of the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced persons are the result of wars that take place on the streets between Christian and Muslim bands with missiles, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes the neck of the empire with a wooden jute in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with his bullet marked at 89 p.m. in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri to about 27 meters from Chelsea port when his team was losing from 1 to 0.
He accommodated the pilot to the left before leaving an incredible trial headed to the second suit.
The shot covered the whole area with a big lift as it moved towards the right corner of the portal.
The pilot finally started the descent over an Arrizabalaga Kepa in full jump to try to stop her and finish up at the bottom of the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position so I could shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it as far as possible, so I tried to create me as long as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kanté came, I had a touch and I didn't think too much of it, I just dedicated myself to hunting."
Chelsea won from 1 to 0 at the rest after marking a hole in 25 minutes by means of its Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the game, the Blue team's front turned back one pass to Matthew Kovacic before starting from almost half the field and printing to Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the middle of the camp.
After all, he did a great thing in depth, which left Hazard in the area with the controlled pilot.
Hazard crossed the defense to finish the second suit with a suit with a left bed where he couldn't get the Liverpool Alison Becker's door.
Liverpool will meet in Naples at the sample League group stage next Sunday at 15:00 at the San Paolo de Napoles Stadium, Italy.
Chelsea will play with the Videoton at UEFA Europe League on Sunday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths for Indonesia tsunamis up to 832
The number of deaths as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis has increased to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped between the ruins of buildings destroyed by the earthquake of magnitude 7.5 which took place on Friday and caused waves up to 6 meters, according to the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho on a press tour.
The city of Palu, of more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder after finding a woman who was murdered.
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found this morning at Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The woman, 44 years old, was found at 7:55 with several hostages in Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as suspects of murder.
The police have asked the inhabitants of the area to see or hear something about the crime they are present in front of the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan's statement: "If the investigation is still in a preliminary phase, I would like to make a call to everyone who is close to John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard anything suspicious, which is put in touch with us.
I would also like to call anyone, especially taxiists who have been able to catch anything through the car's board camera, which are in contact, since they could have vital information for the investigation."
A police officer confirmed that the woman's body they found was from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This evening, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, the police have commented that they are reporting facts to relatives who are closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police have informed him that no one has permission to enter or leave the building.
When she learned what had happened, she was left speechless.
You're warning the residents that they'll be out for hours until they can come in again.
He could feel like a police officer told a man that the whole area is treated like the crime scene.
A woman appeared on the crying scene.
Don't stop saying "It's terrible!"
At 14:00 a.m., two police trucks were found in the area agreed with another train parked outside.
A number of Romanian agents in the agreed area controlling the block of floors.
It is requested that anyone who may have information that sends a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestopers anonymously through 0800 555 111 and forwarding the 247 of September 30 issue.
The British Parliament's Cromwell state became the last monument affected by the discussion about "re-write history"
His disappearance would be a form of poetic justice for the destruction of the purest style of the Taliban of many cultural and religious objects in England inherited by their fanatics of Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "poisonary" and a "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate about the withdrawal of states, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure before Westminster Palace would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclastia of the English civil wars was not ordered nor due to the term Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor that he did during the previous century.
The great representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many still believe is worthy of being remembered.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as a defence of Parliament before external pressure, in its obvious case of monarchy.
Whether or not this fact is an entirely accurate Roman representation is a historical debate.
What's true is that the middle of the 17th century conflict was consistent with the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a blockade of this division.
Their adoptions as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and remembered."
A murdered pig kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his name "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and all blood covered near a pig market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, as reported on Sunday in South China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs into a court in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As you know, he'd traveled on Tuesday with his cousin since Yunnan's neighboring province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him a piece of shit.
According to him, there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth in the court.
The Forensic Review confirmed that the 250 kg garage had been killed by the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had his legs destroyed and full of blood," said the cosy, known as "Wu," according to the news of Guiyang's night.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 a.m. on Sunday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither owned nor owned by Yuan nor by his own body.
One of the market officials commented on the news last night that the pig remained locked and isolated in order to avoid any further attacks, while the police collected evidence on the crime scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although very rare, there have been cases of pigs that attack people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at the Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 300-kg pig caught a galley farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to scare the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was destroyed by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "distinct".
"They like to play.
They're like children, they have a lot of curiosity... they don't have the idea of doing bad.
They only need to be respected," he commented.
The rest of Rosa's hurricane will bring torrential floods across the South-West of the United States
According to forecasts, Rosa's throat is getting weaker as it moves on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry torrential flags across north and south-west Mexico during the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, herself from a category 1, at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, U.S. time, and she located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is starting to form a depression in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving towards the west coast of the United States. As the Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will start leaving a strong tropical humidity in the north-west of the United States.
The Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next, tropical humidity will interact with the depression that is approaching to generate generalised torrential flags across the South-West for the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous rivers, waste flows and the possibility of land degradation in the desert.
The severe tropical humidity will cause some precipitation indexes close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected from 50 to 100 mm of rain to parts of the south-west, especially in large parts of Arizona.
There's a possibility that we're going to get rid of it, since the situation is getting very fast because of the widespread nature of tropical raindrops.
It is strongly advised to enter the desert shortly before the threat of tropical rain.
The torrential plugs could cause the gorges to become uncontrollable rivers. In addition, storms can bring wind and clouds of poles at specific points.
The depression that is about to take place will carry torrential plugs at certain points on the south coast of California.
It is possible to record a total of precipitations of over 50 mm, which could cause lower residue flows and relieving paths.
This would be the first precipitation of the time of the plugin to the region.
Tropical rains will begin to arrive in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more generalized between Monday and Tuesday night.
The torrential flags will spread to the region of the four cantons on Tuesday and will continue for all Sundays.
The October will have several important temperature oscillations for all the US as the Arctic cooled, although tropicals will be very hot.
This phenomenon may cause drastic changes in temperature in a little distance.
The U.S. central region on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
About 20 degrees of temperature have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the constant heat of summer will try to expand again.
It is expected that the month of October will begin with a hot start in most of the central and eastern parts of the United States, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the South to the North-East.
New York City could reach 27 degrees a day, which would represent about 10 degrees a day.
According to long-term forecasts, there are many possibilities for temperatures to be recorded on the average in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million spectators saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement.
More than 20 million spectators saw the passionate witness of the candidate to a member of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which supposedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The witness was retransmitted to six different television lines.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with the issuers interrupting the usual Friday programming due to a round of events in the last minute: an agreement signed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake because the FBI is conducting a charge investigation for a week.
Ford explained to the Senate Committee for judicial matters that he was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh had beaten her and tried to take her off at an institute party.
Kavanaugh, in an elevated witness, claimed that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million spectators have probably seen this witness on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The audit figures were not immediately available for other lines that retransmitted the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen alone has problems when calculating the people he's seen from his office.
In perspective, it's a similar hearing to an American football game or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported the name Kavanaugh, was the most-audited chain, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the day's witness, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS reached 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
The interest remained high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After a communiqué's office issued a communiqué saying they voted in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was arrested by CNN and CBS's cameras on the morning of Friday while he was intimidated by protesters when he tried to get up to an elevator to go to a court hearing.
Flake had a couple of minutes with the naked eye while he was getting back on TV directly to the CNN.
"Here you have me, before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said 'You have power, while there are so many women who don't have it!'
Flake said his office had a communiqué and, before the elevator doors were closed, he commented that he would have more to say in the view of the committee.
Within a few hours, all cable and broadcast lines were already forwarding directly when the Judicial Affairs Committee had to vote whether or not to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh to the floor of the Senate to vote.
Flake said, instead, that he would only understand that the FBI would investigate allegations against the appointment of face to the week he sees, a condition required by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and various senators, Flake made his decision.
The option chosen by Flake had influence, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation for allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" in relation to Brexit
First Minister Theresa May accused those who criticised their plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and to lower national interest in an interview with Sunday Times.
The first British Minister Theresa May attended the convention of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the cover of the paper, former Foreign Minister of May Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chechers plan for Brexit, where he says that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU receive taxes mutually is "absolutely."
The murder of Wade Sims: The police arrest the suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU team player
The police arrested a suspect for the murder of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who was militaryizing the LSU team.
Dytheon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and sent to the charge of murder in second grade, according to Baton Rouge's police department.
The authorities made a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his eyes during the game.
The police recovered their eyes on the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS WAFB's branch report.
After asking Simpson, he admitted that Wade had died of a stroke, according to the police.
His loan was $350,000, according to the attorney's report.
The East Baton Rouge District Forensic Office published a preliminary report on Friday, which states that the cause of death was a head-to-head fire wound.
The department is grateful to the police emergency group in the state of Louisiana, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that has resulted in this detention.
LSU's sports director Joe Alleva expressed his appreciation to the forces of the area's order for his "diligence and for seeking justice."
Sims was 20 years old.

A scenic volcano in Mexico City
The centre dug by the Popocatepetl volcano has arrived in the suburbs of southern Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans on Saturday that they would stay away from the volcano after they had been on the crater and 183 gas emissions were recorded and spent 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several strands and tremulants that had recently been produced.
Images on social networks where there is a fine seat on the car's parachutes in Mexico City's bars like Xochimilco.
Geophysics have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km south of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The Volca, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police are faced with Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favour of independence faced with the anti-aeronautics police and thousands of people joined in protest demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on their secession.
A group of independent individuals detained by the anti-avalated police began to release eggs and paint in powder, which caused the appearance of dark clouds of dust to the streets normally engulfed by tourists.
Later that same day, they produced baptisms with the police, who used their pills to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independent groups sang "Don't forget, don't forgive" face-to-face with unionist protesters calling "Long life in Spain".
Forty people had to be concerned about injuries suffered during protests, according to local sources.
Tension has not decreased in this independent mentality region one year after an illegal referendum was held on October 1st, but also ended by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence for a wider majority, although the participation index was low, since the opposition to the secession voted majorityly.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote by entering the electoral colleges throughout the region, resulting in violent confrontations.
Independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support to the national police.
The demonstration took place at the same time, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, 68-year-old electricist and one of the participants in the independent demonstration together with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of the possibilities of Catalunya associating independence.
"Last year we lived one of the best moments.
I saw how my parents were happy to be able to vote, but now we're locked up," he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although, on a small margin, in the autonomous elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have struggled to maintain the loan this year, since many of their main leaders are in an autoimposed exile or are expected to be judged for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, writes the police support demonstration on his phone and says the conflict has led him into both sides of the conflict.
"The tension only increases," he comments.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the new Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial last year, announced that I would participate in the elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting as a candidate to European elections is the best way to report backlogs in democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after investing a house in a car

It is also possible that, at some point, someone has shot a ballast against the car.
A Menga game won in Livingston for 1 to 0 before Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston was to win
Livingston, who had this year been above category, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in which it is just the second defeat of Steven Gerard in 18 parties as a coach of the Ibrox bar club.
Dolly Menga's game marked the difference, because, with this victory, Gary Holt's team comes to second position, which share with the Hibernia.
Gerard's people, on the other hand, are still unable to win out of home at the Premiership this season, and the next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, who separate them from eight points.
But before that, the Rangers get this lunch from Vienna's Speed to Europe League.
Livingston, while spreading up to six parties his invicted rat to the league, with a Holt as a coach who still doesn't know what the defeat is since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston does not take advantage of its opportunities before the direct game of visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the marker shortly before the ball, since its direct game caused all kinds of problems in Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way between the defense, but he abused his opportunity when he was in front of the gate.
In the locals it was good for them to let the Rangers get into their area, since they knew that visitors could get into trouble on isolated games.
And that's how this decisive hole got here.
The arbiter was missing from the interests of Rangers and Livingston opened up to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so Menga could play it first and finish it from the central part of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated the possession, but he was found with an impeccable defence and a porter Liam Kelly who had little work during the party,
The stage was repeated on the second side, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a stop of merit.
For his part, the porter of Rangers Allan McGregor stopped with his feet one time by Scott Pittman and Lithgow immediately ended another Livingston combination game.
The Rangers dedicated himself to hunting once and for another pilots in Livingstone's area, just to be rejected. They also claimed two sentences, one for a supposed Halkett entry to Glenn Middleton's replacement, and one for another by hand.
Livingston phenomal: analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great performance for Livingston.
A man thinks they're excellent, and they're still going over all the expectations in this upturned trajectory.
His game style and his staff have almost changed since his return to the top category, although most merit has to be assigned to Holt in the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
There was a good bunch of heroes.
Captain Halkett was enormous, at the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be in Menga during the entire party.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the brilliant moments with Gerard as a coach, they certainly did not know how to maintain the level.
They didn't know to create occasions (only once they clearly exceeded local defense), and this Rangers, which is located on the middle of the table, should be taken as a warning.
Agrarian reception for Erdogan in Colonia
All were clear shadows and skyscrapers on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met to breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the Polish visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which was intended to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These have deteriorated because of issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU entry into the EU.
Erdogan, however, moved to Colonia to open a new giant mix.
And it's that this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
The police read out security reasons to avoid a crowd of 25,000 people being gathered in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers called around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also felt as they condemned Erdogan's policies as well as the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of views around the visitor, considered a hero for some German Turks and a dictator title for others.
Deptford traffic accident: a dead cyclist meeting with a car
A cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street road crossings, an area with a power pass from Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, about 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedics managed the cycle, he died in the act.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist died in a case of escape from Children Street, 1.6 km from the scene of the Saturday accident.
The metropolitan police said their agents are working to identify the man and report facts to the closest family members.
The road has been cut off and deviations have been applied for bus routes. In addition, drivers who avoid the area have been advised.
Long Lartin Prison: Six injured agents in an alternative
Six prison officers have been injured in an alternative at this high-security prison center, according to the center's office.
The facts were produced in Long Lartin prison, Worcestershire, at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, local time, and still lost.
Specialized "turned" agents moved to the place of the facts to finish the other one, where eight prisoners were found involved. The suit could be held by a band.
The agents had to be careful about injuries that were left on their faces instead of the facts.
According to a prison service provider: "We have deployed special-trained prison personnel to try to solve an incident in Long Martin's prison, which is still missing.
Six employees have had to be injured.
We're not going to tolerate violence in our prisons.
There are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals, at the Long Lartin prison center.
In June, it was learned that the prison head had to be in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, anti-aircraft agents took action in prison to solve another serious incident in which the center's staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with important rivers (the areas with almost no effect may benefit)
It's not normal for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that's exactly what it's likely to happen at the beginning of the week that you see when the rest of Rosa's hurricane passes through the desert of the south-west, with the resulting risk of rivals.
The national weather service has already alerted by rivers for Mondays and Tuesdays in western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's expected that Rosa will arrive directly at Phoenix on Tuesday and that she'll be near the night of the Monday with arrows.
Phoenix's national weather service commented on a piulada that only "ten tropical cycles have maintained the state of tropical storms or depression in a radius of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950.
The Hurricane Katrina (1967) remained within 64 km of the border with Arizona."
The most recent models of the national hurricane centre provide 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where they can be recorded up to 150 mm in the Arizona Mogollon.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the Central Rockloses and the Great Conca, could be recorded from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points up to 100 mm.
For areas that are at risk of rivals, Rosa’s rain could become a very good news, as the region suffers from a severe drought.
Although the routs are a serious cause of concern, some of the assumptions could be very beneficial, as the region of the south-west is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the US kidnapping control service, more than 40% of Arizona's state suffers as at least extreme, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
But first, Rosa's gonna touch the ground on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have a kiln force in the morning, with a maximum wind of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which makes me lose my strength.
So it's expected to hit the ground in Mexico with tropical storms in the afternoon or the evening of Monday.
Predictions in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of laughing.
According to weather.com, "a total of 75 to 150 mm of rain is expected from Baja California to the north-west of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 250 mm".
After that, Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before arriving at the border with Arizona at the first hour of the morning with tropical depression, to finally extend the state of Arizona and reach south of Utah well into the evening.
"The main risk we expect from Rosa or what is left of it is very strong precipitations in Baja California, northern Sonora and the South-West desert of the United States," according to the national hurricane centre.
It is expected that the floods will cause hazardous rivers and rivers of waste in the deserts, along with land degradation in mountain areas.

She was transferred to the hospital, where she's "stabilized."
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the following day in Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset's police.

Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered the mixture and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote for the judge Kavanaugh is the vote of opposition to the dismissed and incitement tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump ruled in an electoral act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "patched the mix and anger" of the Democratic party during its nomination process.
Kavanaugh declared before the Sunday Congress, renegadely and emotionally Christine Blasey Ford's charge that she had been sexually abused decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also stated his view of his neighbour.
The president said on Sunday that that day, "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, human quality and strength."
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the most brilliant minds of the legal world of our time, a lawyer with an amazing service tractor in the city," said the majority of Western Virginia's sympathizers.
The President referred directly to the name of Kavanaugh while speaking of the importance of the index of participation of Republican voters in the election of half the mandate.
"We have five weeks of one of the most important choices in our lives.
I didn't run, but in fact I did," he said.
"That's why I'm going around fighting for our great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are committed to "resisting and obstructing."
It is expected that the first key procedural vote that will be held at the Senate on the name of Kavanaugh will take place as soon as Friday, according to CNN, an assistant to the leaders of the Republican party.
Hundreds of deaths from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to grow
As at least 384 people have died, and many have been kidnapped by giant waves playing against the beaches, due to a terrible earthquake and tsunami that has affected the Indonesian island of Sulawasi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered together on Friday for a festival held on the beach in the city of Palu when they walked up to six meters to the coast of the capital, shooting many people to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When Tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still going to finish their activities on the beach and they didn't run immediately," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said, bringing BNPB disaster mitigation agency to a communiqué in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, tanks, houses, destroyed everything that was on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved by sea open at 800 km/h before impacting on the coast.
There are people who climbed up a tree running from Tsunami and were able to survive, comment.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency where the amount of damaged shops and buildings is appreciated, stolen and sprayed bridges and a mix of water.
The Replica continued on Saturday this coastal town.
The series of earthquakes was heard in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that energy released by the earthquakes of Friday was about 200 times the power of the nuclear bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographical characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bath, could have increased exponentially the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he comments, were found trapped between the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 displaced.
According to Nugroho, deaths and damages could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, a area called Doghea, near the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralyzed and therefore no information came up" from Donghaa, Nugroho says.
More than 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, which could unfortunately end much worse," I think.
The agency was strongly criticised on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although the agents said the waves had arrived during the time the notice was issued.
In a recording of an affidavit shared in social networks, it can be felt like a man sitting on the top floor of a building giving desperate warnings to people on the street about the tsunami approaching.
In the matter of minutes, a wall of water excavated to the shore of the sea, carrying buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the registration.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a general amount of electricity supply that has interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Despite the fact that the army has begun to send humanitarian aid to cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, evacuateds continue to desperately need food, as well as other basic needs.
The city airport has only been opened for aid tasks and will be closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo was planning to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths for Indonesia's tsunami is over 800.
The situation is very difficult.
Despite the fact that World Vision workers in Doghea were able to arrive without or without escape in the city of Palu, where employees were forced into shelters from lei located at the base of their office, during the march they had to attend total destruction scenes, Doseba says.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's a disaster.
Although relief groups managed to start relief operations, some people complained that they were preventing humanitarian workers from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, supplies and the provision of foreign personnel can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says "Well, it's a national disaster," we can start asking for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared."
While he spent the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place in the morning, friends and family of missing people held the hope that the miracle would occur and their estimated beings would bring to light the devastating report of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was rescued caught in a robbery.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the hole for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandon, the trainer of the Indonesian national team of parapentant, had trained two of the missing parapentists for the Asian Games, who concluded in early this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandiji, among the people arrested at the Roa Roa Roa Hotel, there were his students.
"As a gentleman in the area of the parapet, I have my own emotional burden," he pointed out.
Mr. Gedon explained that, in the hours following the fact that Roa Roa Roa Hotel was being circulated between the parapentist community, he had suddenly sent messages by WhatsApp to the Palu competitors who were participating in the platinum festival.
However, messages appear with a grey check mark instead of a double blue mark.
"I think this means that the messages have not been received," he added.
Some wires carry $26,750 while filling up an automatic box at Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling up an automatic box at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport's police department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy indicated to the communiqué that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the automatic box at the maintenance complex and was preparing to distribute more money.
As he was doing his job, another man "has come running behind Brink's employee" and stole a money box for distribution.
According to the communiqué, the witnesses saw several suspects running from the scene, but the police did not specify the number of incidents involved.
Any person who has information about his identity should contact Newport's police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes the name to Ye
The Kanye West rapper changed the name to Ye.
On Saturday, while he announced his change on Twitter, he wrote: "It was officially known as Kanye West."
Some time ago in West, 41 years ago, the motto with the nickname Ye, and he used these aliases as title of his eight album, which was published in June.
The change occurs before its appearance on Saturday Night Live program, which is expected to present its new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled his participation by "Emotional Motives", according to the program's author.
Rather than being abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, and the Bible means you," said West at the beginning of this year, talking about the title of his album with the Radio Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us.
I've been through Kanye, which means the only one, just Yes, that's a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is more easily a reflection than we are."
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has known him with several names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, an ancient West co-laborator, has won his nickname with the no-guide and in major schools.
Mexico's President, AMLO, promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians, when there is no shortage because the country collects the 50th anniversary of a growing repression against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco's place that "the military force would no longer be used to force the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when student left student movements were moving around Latin America.
López Obrador, who has committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening up more free public universities,
He said that the strike and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The US should double the funds allocated to IA
"While China is increasingly active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money they spend on research in this field," says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional specialist in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments occur after several members of the North American Government have announced IA measures, although there is a general lack of formal IA strategy in the country.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become World Number 1 for innovation in IA in 2030.
"Dublining the budget for research in IA would be a good start, as the rest of the countries are very behind the US and we want to be pioneers of the next developments in the IA field," Lee said.
"Dublining funding could double the opportunities that the United States would attach to the next major discovery in IA," Lee told the CBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director general of the company Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in Face+, one of China's most prominent companies.
In 1980 he worked at the University of Carnegie Mellon in an IA system that won the best rating American player from Othello and then worked as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee positively appreciated previous United States Government technological competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defence Research Agency (DARPA), and wondered when it would take place next so as to identify its own visionaries.
"Many times, North American researchers have to work hard to get public bees," Lee said.
According to Lee, "it's not China that carries academic leaders; it's companies."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have contracted university awards to work in the IA field.
Lee commented that the role of the US in the IA could also be seen motivated by changes in immigration policy.
"I believe that permanent residence cards should be offered to doctors in IA," he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of the Last Generation.
"The National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China grants funds to people of academic institutions the same way that the Foundation of Natural Sciences and other public agencies of the United States give money to North American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower than China," Lee pointed out.
At the beginning of the year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, designed to participate in the industrial sector and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Selection Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a 2,000 million USD investment in an AI Next initiative.
With regard to the Natural Sciences Foundation, more than 100 million U.S. dollars a year is currently being spent on IA research.
In the meantime, months ago no measure was applied in relation to North America's legislation which was intended to create a National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the name of the country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change in the name of 'Northern Republic of Macedonia', a measure that would resolve a dispute that had existed with Greece for decades, which had blocked Macedonia's requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, supports that the name of its north-east visa constitutes a claim from its territory and has invited it to join NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalists argued that the change would save the ethnic identity of the Macedonian majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has shown that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign questions whether it will reach at least 50% of the necessary participation because the referendum is valid.
The question mentioned in the referendum paper is: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with accepting the agreement with Greece?"
The parties to the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying to ensure Macedonia's accession, one of the countries that were created after Yugoslavia's deintegration, to agencies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote today for the future of the country, because young people in Macedonia could live freely throughout the European Union, because it means that we will all have a safer life," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have shown that it will attack the outcome of the vote to make it a decision.
To change the name, a majority of two-thirds of Parliament is required.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there had been no irregularity at 13:00.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent registered in the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, in which 66 per cent of the registered persons voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old at the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country, which would open the way for accession to the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small scenario and placing chairs in front of the tents installed by people who would vote for the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join the top, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we do not want to be accepted as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and form part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO's incorporation will be accompanied by more investments than you need in Macedonia, which has a rate of unemployment of over 20%.
"I think the great majority will vote in favour, because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev pointed out before depositing his paper.
Zaev showed that a "yes" would assume "confirmation of our future".
In a recent survey published by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia, between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of the voters participated in the referendum, a figure below the minimum necessary participation.
According to the results of another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV chain, 57% of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said he would vote "yes".
Because the referendum is valid, participation must be 50% more than one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hard time for the policies of the Western Government since May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Aguiro, from Manchester City, makes a hole after re-establishing all the defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguiro and Raheem Sterling canceled Brighton's defense in Manchester City's victory for 2 to 0 at the party at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.
Agejo marked a hole at 65 minutes in a game that seemed ridiculously simple.
The next Argenti received a pass in the middle of the camp at the beginning of the sequence.
He walked fast between three Brighton defenses, shooting at what he went through through the field of the game.
Later, Aguro saw himself surrounded by four green Samaritans.
He re-registered a defense before he crossed a few more on the board of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass on his left that Sterling found.
The English front returned the pilot to the first touch, in the area, in Aguro, which with the right bed hit the bridge porter of Brighton, Matthew Ryan, with a juice that collapsed inside the network on the right side.
"Agüro has foot disorders," Pep Guardiola, a city trainer, told reporters.
"We have decided to play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky I marked a hole at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the first advantage to Sky Blues in the fight for the First League.
His goal was to arrive at the 29th.
In that game, Aguro got the pilot deep in the Brighton field and
He made a beautiful pass through space on the left side of Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the pilot before she passed it to Sterling's long leg.
Sky Blues' front ended the pilot inside the network before he got out of the background line.
The City is faced on Tuesday at Hopeneheim at the time of the team phase of the League Championships, at 18:55 p.m., at Rhein-Neckar-Arena, in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, no options, wants to remove Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the game-off struggle, there were no good reasons to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, looks forward to going out to the mount of the launcher Sunday that comes against the Colorado Rockies, if the Rockies, who keep a party of advantage over Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, have the possibility of playing the play-off.
The Rockies made sure a match with the victory for 5-2 against the Nationals Friday night, but they're still trying to get their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can go out knowing the environment here, in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably dispute every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this party?"
The Nationals still have to announce an open fireman for Sunday, but they're apparently determined to let Scherzer go if this situation happens.
Scherzer, who would do his 34th opening, held a morning heating session and would launch Sunday, on his usual rest day.
Washington's right-hand launcher has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 removals per strike in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump has a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation surrounding his application for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of the participation of republics in the mid-term elections.
"All we've done is in November.
It takes five weeks for one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the great, great. I don't present myself, but I actually do. That's why I'm everywhere fighting for the great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You can see this terrible, horrible group of Democrats is happening right now.
They're determined to recover power for all the necessary means, they see their mix, their evil intent.
They don't care who do wrong, about who they have to go through to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them."
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is "resisting and obstructing".
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he protested, and titled the democracies of 'uses, masks, gross and false'.
Trump recalled dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking democratic senator of the Senate's Judicial Committee, which caused a strong written public opinion.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, no, wait a minute... this was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party has stopped being a different party.
He's intolerant with those who say what they think.
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised.
In the end, I'm the last of a series of British parliamentarians who have told us that we're not welcome, all to say what we think.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because he demonstrated with determination against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censorship he criticized me for discrepancy with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe.
In the notice of the Friday meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party, it was announced that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During most of my eight years as a local worker parliamentarian, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and it's been a long time since the promise of "more generous and kind" policies has been forgotten, if there has ever been.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated by the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged according to whether it is acceptable for the party's direction.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as his colleagues once thought he shared a political vision that seemed to expect me to make a 180th round and take positions that would never be adopted, either on national security or on the EU's single market.
When I speak in public, say what I say, social networks are filled with aggressive messages about what is being called because my candidate is not renewed, the central policies are denounced and I'm told that it shouldn't be the Labour Party.
And that doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the messages I receive are often political.
I'm impressed by the professionality and determination of colleagues who have to face up to a torrent of ongoing and racist attacks every day, and they don't run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this was politics is to see how the abuse level has been standardized.
Jeremy Corbyn stated last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we're not that different game anymore, and with every move of "untrusted" or any change in the selection standards, the game got more extreme.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice, and I've been advised to keep my head down, that it wasn't so expressive and "all would be fine."
But I didn't get involved in politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my school year, inspired by thatcher's negligating government, who left my whole class literally confused, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it more, whether as a local adviser or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted tomorrow's movement, I would tell them that at a time when the country goes to a Brexit that will damage places, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to lose time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, the message I want to transmit did not lead to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are employees or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of non-renewal my candidate or any political interest will prevent me from acting, according to my opinion, in the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr Imbawatts Head the Leader
Two final attempts last hour corrupted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs won the victory in this lively part of the day of the Tenant's Premiership.
The Ayrs, which are the only team of ten, take the first position on the classification table.
In the end, the local team was imposed thanks to its defence superiority and the fact that he knew better to take advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
"The games we've played so far have tested us and we're still trapped, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Thank you to the Ayrs, they have taken advantage of the best opportunities than we have."
Grant Anderson's test at the 14th minute converted by Frazier Climo, put before the Ayr, but a bold card for the Scottish international Rory Hughes, awarded for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the digital superiority and Jason Baggot noted an unconverted test.
Climo extended the advantage of the Ayrs with a penalty and, just in the middle, recorded and converted an attempt to put the 17-5 mark on the Ayrs to rest.
But the Melroses started well on the second part and on Patrick Anderson's test, converted by Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
Later, the party stopped for a long time because of the serious injury suffered by Ruarahh Knott, which was withdrawn in letter, and the Ayr recovered again with a test by Stafford McDowell converted to climate.
Next, Deputy Captain Blair Macpherson was amnestyed with a rough card and, again, the Melroses took advantage of the superiority of a man more with an unconverted test by Bruce Colvine at the end of a time of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a landing in Climo without a pilot, since the sanctions were finalized, MacPherson recorded a password behind the cloud entering the Airs.
Climo noticed, as he had done almost since the raid, after Kyle Rowe picked up a suit from David Armstrong and passed the pilot on the third line to Gregor Henry to record the five tests of the local team.
The Still Game series star seems to be about to start a new career in the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems to be about to pass through the hotel sector after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a restaurant company with a license.
The actor, 56 years old, interprets Jack Jarvis's character into the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-protagonizes with Greg Hemphil, his comical couple long ago.
The two announced that the ninth season would be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Aposymorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, although a source from The Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter the "floorant restaurant" sector of Glasgow.
"The Sea Is Ours": Bolivia, without litoral, expects the court to reopen its path to the Pacific
The mariners patrol their coastal fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings are wearing a blue flag of sea colour.
The ships from Lake Titicaca to the Amazons are encapsulated with the theme: "The sea is ours by right.
Getting it back is a debt."
Around the borderless territory of Bolivia, the record of a lost coast before Xile in a resource conflict that continues to be very alive in the 19th century, as is the angel of the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the deepest in decades, while Bolivia expects the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and seriousness, and, I don't need to say, wait with a positive attitude," pointed Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the TIJ resolution on large screens around the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will say in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Xile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Here Morales, the original charismatic president of Bolivia, who faces a Polish battle for the election next year, also has many hopes set in the resolution on Monday.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific Ocean," he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court would decide in favor of Bolivia and that if it did, things would not change much.
The United Nations body based on the Netherlands has been unable to assist Chile and has established that it will not determine the outcome of the possible talks.
The TIJ resolution, which took place only six months after the final allegations were submitted, indicated that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist at international law.
And far from seeing her favorite, the cause of Bolivia may have experienced a relapse in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian Administration has taken over the issue of sea access," Zárate pointed out.
"The billing rhetoric of Morales has mined any good-willed gesture by Xile," he suggested.
Bolivia and Xile will keep talking for a while, but it will be very difficult to keep conversations after this episode.
The two countries did not exchange ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Tribunal's decision-making was extremely rapid.
The next Monday Bolivia will have "a special opportunity to start a new era of relations with Xile" and an opportunity to "get up to 139 years of discretion, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who continues to be one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can be trusted in the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
The Minister urged the United States to keep promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
Their statements come at a time when U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to resume the prolonged nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a shame to think that the continued sanctions and the US objection to a declaration that puts an end to the Korean War can make North Korea ever more vulnerable.
Washington refuses to accept the statement if Pyongyang does not make major disarmament movements.
Both Kim and the president. North America Donald Trump want to celebrate a second summit.
However, there is a generalised specicism about the fact that Pyongyang is seriously taking the issue of giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris's fashions reveal the last range of large size bars, from the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your collection of bars or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look for more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented to her the passerby a range of disproportionate barbed bars of their SS19 collection, which led to the style defined at the Paris Mode Week.
This is the Instagram has been drawn by very few practical bars, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the gateway.
The most prominent part of Valentino was an overcrowded bead, decorated with a wide wing, with a plume shape, which poured out the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were happy chairs, a brush bar, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Tom Browne also presented a selection of extraflorous masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, living colors, had cosy lips and seemed more than Hannibal Lecter than they did.
One creature looked like a complete team of submarines, with tubes and eyes, while another looked like a frozen ice cream.
And if you follow the big trends of fashion, you're lucky.
The style observers predict that huge bars could be installed on the main streets near you.
Large-sized bars cut down "the Bomba", a wooden bar with two feet wide, which everyone has brought, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label of worship behind the so little practical bar that spread through the social networks brought another great creation to the passerby: a wooden box for the beach, almost as large as the model dressed with a bather as he wore it.
The raffle box, dark-coloured taronja, decorated with raffles and finished with a white leather nose, was the most prominent part of the collection The SS19 River of Jacquemus in the Paris Moda Week.
"I hope to see people carrying large bars and silver boxes on the main streets next summer. Given that the designer has had a great impact, it would be a pity to ignore the demand for large sized accessories.
John Edward: Linguistic competences are essential for world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain an academic excellence trajectory that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent results, which is strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), are working to provide the best level of service for students and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for postgraduate and higher education, for the career they pursue, and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a very popular and desired subject of education in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will get to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will come to his heart."
This is a very important reminder that we can't rely only on English if we want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the survey, we can see that languages lead classification tables with higher qualifications in independent schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages received note A above.
Data collected from 74 schools member of SCIS reflected that 72% of students obtained a higher A qualification in Mandari, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, such as the electoral assignment, are kept in mind that STEM assignments (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) are based on independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey carried out by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission revealed that 17% of the reasons why businesses had given up on vacations were attributed to lack of linguistic skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
As there are more and more potential job opportunities that require language, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career a person takes, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competence like that.
The fact that you can communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in front of competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% did not speak a foreign language enough to keep a conversation, and French, with 15% speaking, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
That's why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Knowing different languages, especially developed economies, will give children the best opportunity to find an important job.
There's a difference between schools in Scotland because of what they do in the languages they teach.
Some schools focus more on the more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered more important for the United Kingdom in the future than in 2020, such as Mandari or Japanese.
Whatever your son's interest, he can always choose between a number of languages in independent schools, which count with staff specialist teachers in this area.
Scotch independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In today's global commercial environment, languages cannot be denied having a vital importance for the country's future, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication competences".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
You have to do it.

LeBron will start with the Lakers in San Diego Sunday
The wait has practically ended up for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play the first pre-emergency game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But they still have to determine the minutes they're gonna play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton at the Lakers' office.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers journalist, tweeted that James is probably gonna play for a few minutes.
After training for principles this week, James was asked about his plans for the calendar of six pre-emergency Lakers parties.
"I don't need premature parties at this stage of my career to be ready," he replied.
Jump Mitting to West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a campaign campaign campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five program sessions from Trump for the next week, which includes visits to compassionate places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote of confirmation for its candidate to cover the vacancy in the Supreme Court is pending, Trump intends to obtain support for the next half-command elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's encounter in West Virginia tonight and how can it be seen online?
The Trump Mitting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19 a.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The Trip Mitigation in West Virginia can be seen online at the following link, via direct video transmission via YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will cancel this week's hearing with the candidate appointed by the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was arrested for sexual abuse charges against him, while the Senate's anticipated confirmation vote is held pending for a week and the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main objective of this meeting is to help the Republicans present at the delicate November elections to take the momentum.
Therefore, the five meetings of President Trump's campaign scheduled for the next week are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and sympathizers, while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, when we go to a time of campaign," said a spokesman from Trump who refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
This evening's meeting, programmed at Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could gather compatriots "from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the coverage of Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Sunday will be the second time Trump visits Virginia from the West, the state where he won over 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a candidate who is repugnant to the West Virginia Senate, who is having unpleasant results in these investigations.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and push him on these questions," commented Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: North American team shows its ambition to keep alive the hope of face to individual Sunday parties
After three uneven sessions, Saturday afternoon mornings were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The treadmill of dynamics is an inventive sport concept in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So on what side is the positive dynamic now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I think we're on a small positive line," Jordan Spieth said while he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, four points forward, with twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little in its favor and have many reasons to be encouraged, mostly by the state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has been fatal from tea to green and is setting an example.
The loud bells of the celebration rose in intensity as he continued his turn and stood a crucial hole to carry the fourth party, when he and Thomas were two down after two forts.
He celebrated what made them win the game at the 15th gate with a similar cry, which indicates that he believes the American team is not out of competition yet.
"You have to do your utmost and worry about your own party," said Spieth.
It's all that's left for these players now.
18 forts to leave print.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the incredible sensation of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple bear four and do not make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a fool of the evening, and also avoided the fooles of the morning and Friday of the evening, and the last nine forts of the morning.
Because of this result and the way its energy seems to flow to and from public advertising, it is reaffirmed that they are players on Sundays, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun is on Le Golf National.
Better both times in different forums.
However, talking about European glory seemed too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four-balls, who had sex with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine forts drowned Spanish and Swedish in a hole where they never had any choice to leave.
It's Sunday, but there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The forums and forums are very fascinating to see for the interactions between the devices, the advice they give and those they don't give, and the way a strategy can change from time to time.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this forum has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight some, especially in the United States, have questioned.
Europe to the end of Ryder Cup with a 10-6 bookmark
Europe will face Ryder Cup's last day with a comfortable advantage after finishing the drills and Saturdays with a 10-6 win over the United States.
The two-shaped inspiration by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and to leave his record, until now, at four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, captain of Thomas Bjorn, who dreamed of preserving the trophie that was lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team a little uncertain about the morning's football and set the series on 3-1.
The U.S. presented more resistance to feeders and won two parties, but they were unable to reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to get eight points to 12 individual Sunday parties to keep the trophie.
Fleetwood is the first European starting point to achieve four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as "Mollwood" after a week's sensitivity, are only the second couple to win four points in their first four parties in the story of Ryder Cup.
After slaving Woods and Patrick Reed at the quarries, they sounded a brilliant act to beat down a Woods deflate and American debuter Bryson Dechambeau for an even more impressive 57-4.
Woods, who had been dragged into two parties on Saturday, showed sporadic geniuses, but he lost 19 out of 29 parties in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who didn't take part in the morning's games, remarried with Henrik Stenson in the matches and fell 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, classified as the first and third of the world, respectively.
However, Europe had nothing to do with it in a pleasant day and winds up in the southwestern part of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times the tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a point for Americans on Saturday to get two points.
They won a victory with determination for 2 to 1 against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the Fourballs and later they won Poulter and Rory McIllroy for 4 to 3 in the Fours, after losing the first two forts.
Only twice in the story of Ryder Cup a team had raised a difference of four points to individual parties, although Furyk's team, a champion of the title, just needs to be empathized to preserve it.
However, after having been the second best for two days, it seems that an attack is coming out of his pocket.
North Korea declares that it will not be unilaterally "in no way" if trust signals are not appreciated
North Korea's Foreign Minister communicated to the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were increasing its confidence in the United States and that, in such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "good-willing measures" during the previous year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, detonating the nuclear testing centre and committed itself to not proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not observe any response in the US consensus," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not start disarmament unilaterally in any way."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "by-step" denuclearization approach by which North Korea would be rewarded as it took pauulating measures, its statements seemed significant because it did not reject the unilateral denuclearization of the whole, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump at the first summit between a US President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim committed himself to working on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has tried to formalize the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has announced that before Pyongyang has to eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
"The US insists that at first it must produce denuclearization and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive way, in addition to resisting the "declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions will make us angry is a smile of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are boosting our confidence."
Ri did not refer to plans to celebrate a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If South Korea had been involved in the issue of nuclear disarmament instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have happened to this situation."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from what it kept last year, when it declared to the General Assembly of the United Nations that heading to the U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump titled Kim "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
In the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for her courage to take disarmament measures, but it showed that it still remains much to do and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
Last Sunday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that "it doesn't matter if they're two years old, three years or five months old."
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should predominate Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo made a statement yesterday to the United Nations Security Council that "the implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue in force and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearization".
The Security Council has consistently imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funding for the ballistic and nuclear missiles programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and then reported that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go very well.
He left Pyongyang the month of July saying he had made progress, but for a few hours North Korea accused him of making "the own demands of a guest".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to disbanding a mission centre and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "consonance measures".
He said Kim had informed him that the "consensual measures" he was looking for were the security measures that Trump had promised Singapore, in addition to actions to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a lesson on rest habits
Enguny, a new course at Harvard University has allowed his students to sleep more, in an attempt to fight culture, every time it gets bigger, to study all night, stimulated by caffeine.
One academic observed that students in a number of universities or in the world are often disappointed by the basics about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sound Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his species in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after a debate on the impact that his privacy had on learning.
"At the end of the conversation, a girl approached me and said, "Why are they telling me now, all of this, in my last year?"
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sound, which surprised me," reported The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are told the basic concepts about how some good habits of sound improve academic and sport performance, in addition to general welfare.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the University decided to introduce the course after learning that some students were suffering from a severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, for an hour, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there's a picture of a bedroom, where students have to click on coffee rates, curtains, drums and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how sports performance affects the lack of sound, and about the importance of maintaining a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sound privacy can increase the risk of heart attacks, brain disorders, depression and cancer.
Next, a map of the fields with interactive icons encourages participants to think on their daily route.
"We know that students' conduct will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes for health," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to keep awake all night, he said, and he added that modern technology and pressure are growing that students suffer make the privacy of sound a problem more and more important.
To make sure to enjoy a sound of good quality for a long time should be a "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, added, even to avoid weight gain, since the privacy of their brain puts it in induction mode and makes students always win.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard during his first year.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the field.
The next step, he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to carry out a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students take into account the fact that they are alert when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit the electronic screens and LED lights, which can change the harmony of the ircadian rhythm and cause sound problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's gol ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's bullet condemns Steven Gerarrd's disarticated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's house which assumes another suspect outside.
Ibrox's team sought to take his first victory at home from the triumph of February 4 to 1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team won the second defeat in Gerarrd in 18 parties as a trainer to leave his team to inherit, at 8 points of the Hearts, the inalienable leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga noticed the hole seven minutes ago in the middle, and it never seemed like the Rangers, lacking inspiration, was about to equal the marker.
While the Rangers now fall into the sixth place, Livingston puts to the third position, behind the Hibernian for a difference of waves.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties later, as the Calum Spence line judge needed medical attention for a wound to the head caused by an object that was apparently launched from the grade.
Gerard made eight changes in respect of the alignment that threw the Ayr out at the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same 11th title that launched a point against Hearts last week.
Although the Rangers dominated the possession, Livingston was more dangerous when they had the pilot.
In fact, they should have marked the two-minute party, when Menga's first intervention left Scott Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the matchmaker jumped away and took advantage of the great opportunity.
A missing release by Keaghan Jacobs met with Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow just made a move to the rear.
The Rangers did control, but they seemed to have more hope than they had at the end of their game.
Alfredo Morelos really thought he should have had a penalty for the 15-minute signal, because he and Steven Lawless met, but Arbitr Steven Thomson ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only led two juries to the first part, but Ibrox's first porter, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibary's head and Ovie Ejaria's docile.
Since the first act of the Levites at 34 minutes could have been against the road, no one can deny that they deserved it only because of their efforts.
Again, the Rangers couldn't break with Jacobs' work game.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the pilot to Scott Robinson, who kept the calm to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard acted on the break by changing Coulibally by Ryan Kent. The change had a practically immediate impact, since the extreme took a walk in Morelos, although the imposter Kelly ran into the blockade.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture the attention of the visitors by playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett doing long walks, one after the other.
Holt's band could've given the direction at the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow made a runaway trial from the corner.
The replacement of the Rangers Glenn Middleton still asked for a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson made his big eyes.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger accountant
And now a page from "Sunday Morning" German: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physical future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that finally gave place to the device we know as Geiger's computer.
Count Geiger, who has been a pillar of science since then, has also become a pillar of pop culture, such as the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", sponsored by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, apparently failed physical vacuum cleaners:
Man: "What's this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger accountant, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earpieces, you can hear the effects of atoms that trigger radioactivity on minerals."
Evans says, "I'm sure it's starting out now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd anniversary.
But the invention that brings her name is still alive.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" and eliminate malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize negative cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and changing them to the laboratory
You can "see" a common protein in many cancers and then reinject them.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the ovarian cancer disappearing for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, changing them to the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then re-injecting them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results we have achieved suggest we have a promising vaccine."
Her2 protein "failures the growth of various types of cancer", including mother, ovaries, lungs and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar focus is to extract immune cells from patients and "instructe" these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West sank into a pro-Turp diaphragm with a MAGA gorge after its implementation in the SNL program.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was written in the study during the Saturday Night Live program after a cachotic action that congratulated US President Donald Trump, and said he would present himself at the 2020 elections.
After his third night song, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a dress from Make America Great Again, he began to criticise the Democrats and repeat his support to Trump.
"Whenever I talk to white people they say to me: How can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if I were worried about racism, I'd left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, where Hollywood star was excommunicated by Brett Kavanaugh's witness before the Senate's Trial Committee for sexual assault charges filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it didn't issue, Eater Chris Rock raised the recording of West's disapproval on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make West ridiculous with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that it wasn't treated well among hostages because of the throat it had.
"They threatened me between hostages.
They told me you didn't come out with that stuffed gorilla.
I had to be an ass.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the lower position?" while he said that he would put Superman's layer so they couldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments provoked public writers at least twice and the program team members seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, who had a reporter who explained to the publication: "The whole study remained completely silent."
West was taken as the last hour's replacement of Ariana Grande, the ex of which, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West left a good part of the public with the interpretation of the song I love it, with Perrier's amplitude.
West obtained the promotion of the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the strongest spirits: Thank you for going into the Multitude."
But the chairman of the debate program, Karen Hunter, pointed out that the West was just "who is and which is absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by means of his music or his clothes or by supporting his art) who I think he's adopting and spreading an ideology that damages my community.
He's free.
And so did we," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that his name had changed and that he was now "the first known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
His rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, before he was called Snoop Lion and the missing legend of Prince music changed his name by a symbol and, later, the artist formerly known as Prince.
Impunity murder charge for assault at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was arrested in East Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackmore.
It is expected that the accused will be compared to the first instance court of Belfast on Monday.
The tax office will review the charges.
The throne star Kit Harington charges a toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for representing the role of army officer Jon Snow in the series of violent media fantasy of HBO Thrones.
However, 31-year-old actor has denounced viral heroin stereotypes, claiming that these papers make it clear that young people often believe they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with the culture magazine of The Sunday Times, Kit said he thought "something was going wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who has recently married the co-protagonist of the Trons game, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, has admitted that she is strongly determined to face this problem.
"Personally, now I wonder where we've been wrong about what's going on in masculinity," he says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?"
According to Kit, television can play a role in increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its so-called viral characters.
He added, "What's inside and what's acquired?
What does it teach on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel they have to have this face of violence?
I think it's one of the great questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because there's no doubt something wrong with the young boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prequalification or piece of throne game when the end of the series is scheduled for the next summer, saying it's made of battles and horses.
Since November, Kit will mark a resurgence of Sam Shepard's True West work, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that knowing his friend Rose is the best thing he's ever given him the throne game.
"I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygrite's role, the love of the character representing Kit, Jon Snow, in the winning fantasy series of an Emmy.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family’s home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in new cases of 14%
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are over 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 were 40,000 new cases declared.
The vast majority of cases are new sexual transmissions, unlike what happened in the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spread rapidly in some parts of China due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who fight HIV for this cause has been reduced almost zero, according to the Chinese health officials' statements at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Over the years, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was eradicated in China in 1997, but discrimination in the LGBT collection is common.
Taking into account the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who keep homosexual relations will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to lack of adequate precautions in sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has filtered out data from the Republican Party's senators and rejects "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced Sunday allegations that one member of his staff had published personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on the pages of Wikipedia by legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles demanded that demands be motivated by critical and web sites on the right.
"Ministers, lies, and more petty lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
Apparently, the information published contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published by someone unknown to the Capitol during a session of the Senate commission on sexual abuse charges against the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was filtered after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative locations, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of publications was related to the Waters office and revealed information from a member of Waters staff, accused Capitoli.
"This unfounded complaint is completely false and a pure lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, the identity, the personal data and the security of which have been compromised because of these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for this information filtering.
This unfounded complaint is completely false and pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly generated criticism online, including the press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of indigence," Fleisher wrote.
"This makes me think he doesn't have the time to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to get angry.
You don't have to be challenging.
You don't have to question the reasons for the attacker.
You must keep your peace and your sir."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, to which critics accused him of being too angry during the lunch session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was presenting himself to expel Waters from the mid-legislative elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It's important if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had warned the authorities and security forces concerned about these fraudulent statements.
"We will ensure that the criminals are revealed, he continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all the actions that have taken place and that they have all and every member of my staff."
Critic of Johnny English Strikes Again: limited spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It's already a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this reposition of the franchise of Johnny English's co-operation parody, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and came back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
Will this humorous self-assembly about how we're mendable will be a new export opportunity in the country?
In any case, the incompetence of the eyes and face of the Johnny English Goma has been able to renew its license for the second time to turn it all over. Its name indicates more than anything else that is a chemical creation designed for non-English-speaking territories with tradition to go to the cinema.
Obviously, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his few claims of liquid glamming, has a little bit of Clouseau, a point by Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy that brings only one note on the theme of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
It was originally based on the international and mysterious Atkinson tour that represented the now forgotten Barclaycard television ads, where he was sowing chaos around.
There's one or two good moments on this last JE trip.
I liked Johnny English, who was dressed in a helicopter with a medium-sized armor and the helms of his helmet were pulled back into his pocket.
There's the gift that Atkinson has for the physical comedy, but humour seems quite fluid and extremely superfluous, especially because "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
The humour seems to be intended for children more than adults and, to me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as clever or focused as the soft gags of Mr. Bean who represents Atkinson.
The topial premium now is that Great Britain is in serious problems.
An IT pirate has infiltrated the British supersecret web network and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground, which leads to the harassment of the service agent, a paper that is unfortunately small for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last resource for a prime minister who is a pretentious and aggrieved figure, who has already suffered a total collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives her own best with this person named Teresa-May, but the guide doesn't go any further.
His intelligence advisers report that, as each active spy is put at risk, he will have to recover some of his retirement.
And this includes poor Johnny English, now employed as a teacher in some luxury institution, but by participating extra-official classes about how to become a covert agent, with some good gags, as when English offers a spy school that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his next Bough patient, paper representing Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, linked to a submarine commander, an enthusiastic paper, where Vicki Pepperdine is a little unprofited.
So, Batman and Robin when things are very light in His Majesty's secret service they take action once more and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the first minister falls dangerously under the auspices of the technological billions of charismatics who claim to be able to solve the computer problems of Great Britain: left Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their ridiculous taste of gorillas: they fire a French fast-food restaurant, they smell the chaos on the board of Volta luxury iota and English cause a great confusion by trying to use a virtual reality case to familiarize themselves with the inside of Volta house.
All the stops have certainly been pulled out of this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, everything seems like a childish program.
It's pretty normal.
As with other Johnny English films, it's not helpful to wonder if the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that makes his talent fair.
The Labour Party denies that I'm setting up a plan because the British have a four-day working week and five-day cover.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan for which the British will work four days a week and cover five days.
It is assumed that the party wants the heads of companies to pass the savings achieved by the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers by giving them a more party day.
The employees would enjoy a three-day head of the week, but they won't get the same amount of money.
According to sources, the idea would fit into the economic agenda of the parties and plans to attract the country for workers.
The change in a four-day work week is based on the support of trade union Congress Congress as a method so that workers can benefit from economic change.
An experienced source of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
It won't be night and day, but a working week of four days is an apex that matches the view of the party to balance the economy in favour of the worker and the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a working week of four days during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this hope collectively at present.
According to a reporter of the Labour Party: "A working week of four days is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used the conference last week to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "experts" to public service companies.
The Minister's shadow plans also imply that water companies shareholders could not recover all the investment, as the labor government could apply "deductions" to crimes that you understand.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers at companies' meetings and create property funds, including to release 10% of private sector firms to employees, which are expected to engage annual dividends for up to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains "60 Minutes" if Kavanaugh's investigation of the FBI could make them change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of its appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and has raised the question of whether the Agency's findings could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be published on Sunday, the "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring them to the light something that would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than her South Carolina colleague.
"Do it seriously," said Kennedy.
"At the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when he passed away and the charges were made public, and I asked if he had done so.
It was shown to be firm, determined and secure."
But Graham's vote seems to be burned.
"I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would present an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejected it around," Graham added referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people you name will be able to verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents an absolutely impressive star programme, which brings about a mission of the same impressive: eradicating poverty in the world.
In the weekly edition, Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people meeting in the Great Lawn Central Park area not only to enjoy events such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken the awareness of the global objective of the event to end extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that looks forward to ending poverty by increasing the number of people helping to combat it actively.
To get a free entry for the event (before someone wants to pay a VIP entry), the attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteer work now, send an email to a world leader, make a phone call or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What success has Global Citizen now had when he is 12 years old to achieve his goal?
The idea of awarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand an action call or just one more case than what we call "clivism" (by thinking it marks the difference to sign an online request or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that more than 19 million "actions" have been recorded by its compatriots, which have helped to achieve various objectives.
It states that these actions have helped to stimulate global leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to US$ 37,000 million, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2,250 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group increased 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10,000 has already been cancelled or received.
The group estimates that the funds currently covered have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the Foundation The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and contractors with them in the United Kingdom, which is committed to "help children grow as much as possible" and promises to send $35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a few pages of history," said The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ulman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions called for in the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+F's website that asked "What makes you think we can end with extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard way. Sometimes we will fall and fall.
But as the great civil rights defence movements and against previous apartheid, we will triumph, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monée are some of the artists who will act on the New York event, which will present Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use marine as "blocking" to block Russian energy exports (Internal Secretary)
Washington can, "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from attacking markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke has complained that Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly where we are invited by the legitimate government, is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flag of Europe," he reportedly said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that marine life is open and, if necessary, for the blockade, to prevent its energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants to the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the "Energy Consumer's Way" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and he pointed out that they are actually equal.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to use and replace fuels," he said, indicating that Russia has only one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements arrive while the Trump administration has been on a mission to promote the export of its natural gas liquid to Europe, in Russia, the most economic option for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to come out of the North Stream 2 "inadequate" gas pipeline project, which is said by Trump, turned Berlin into Moscow's "capital".
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has cost 11,000 million dollars and will double its capacity of 110,000 cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers, Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organization of the German Federation of German Industries has called on the US to base EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren stated that he "will "think firmly" his candidate for the presidency in 2020.
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that "I'd think firmly" his candidate for the presidency after the mid-legislative elections.
At a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his application.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix the government's fracture, that women take high positions," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take my candidate seriously to the president."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said that "he was taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I am quite concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Tuesday Tuesday night, Warren said, "Of course you need an FBI investigation before the elections."
However, a survey published on Sunday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed that they should not be present for 2020.
A fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "problem" voters said that the senator should not be present, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent donor support for the candidate.
The survey revealed a broader support for the candidateship of Governor Deval Patrick, with a 38 per cent advantage of a possible candidate and 48 per cent against.
Other high-profile names among the Democrats taking into account a possible candidate for 2020 include Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would reveal his decision officially to the general, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites the impact of TEPT Track Palin on Donald Trump's myth
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after being listed on September 11, 2007
Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"With what is happening to my own son since he came back, I can understand other families suffering from TEPT ramifications and some of the emotional wounds our soldiers return with," he explained to the public at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following of his son and other war veterans: "They're a little different, they're patient, they're going to ask if there's respect for his soldiers and pilots, and like any other member of the army, they've given it to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a declaration of domestic violence and armed violence under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Vasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Twenty states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge to a new US policy that denies asylum to victims who flee from gangs or domestic violence
The representatives of 18 states and the district presented a Friday's curial friend to Washington to pick up an asylum applicant who challenged the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the request for Grace vs Sessions that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented the month of August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said his couple "and the children of the gang gang" added it, but the U.S. officials denied his asylum application on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are born in the United States, such as countries facing generalized gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy rejected a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to escape domestic violence to request it.
General prosecutor of the District of Colombia, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
The federal laws require asylum applications to be assisted according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the curial friend.
Lawyers also argued in the report that policies that deny immigration entry damage the US economy, as it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "proportional jobs".
In June, general prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant any more victims of domestic violence and gangs.
"The asylum is available for those who leave their country for persecution or for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions at its announcement of 11 June of this policy.
The asylum has never been able to solve all the problems, not even the worst, that people face every day around the world.
desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in an esprint to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very quiet," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusumuma while resting her son off with fever at an evacuation centre in the city destroyed by Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings bodies.
No water is available."
Residents have been seen to return to their destroyed homes to take in flood-relevance and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of injuries, and hospitals, sick of 7.5 magnitude six, are satisfied.
Some of the wounds, including Dwi Haris, which broke the spatula, are outside Palu's military hospital, as patients are being treated outside because of the strong wounds they repeat.
The tears of her eyes turned down as she explained how the violent earthquake destroyed the room of the fifth floor of the hotel where she met her wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris explained to Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
"I felt my wife asking for help crying and then I didn't feel her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The US ambassador accuses China of "advertising ads".
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page announcement in a North American newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the North American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump spoke last Sunday about China's payment supplement to The Des Moines Register, the most recent newspaper of the state of Iowa, after he accused China of joining the US Congress on 6 November, he accused China of refusing.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to get involved in the US elections marked what North American officials told Reuters that it is a new phase of the Washington campaign to intensify pressure on China.
Although it's normal for foreign governments to introduce ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that is intensifying and has seen to support the tariffs in mutual imports.
China's fine oranges at the beginning of the commercial war were aimed at punishing exporters of states, such as Iowa, who now supported the Republical Party of Trump, according to Chinese and North American experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and governor of Iowa for a long time, an important exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had damaged workers, farmers and businesses in the United States.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It is redoubled with the publication of advertising ads on our free press."
"In publishing its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the popular North American tradition of freedom of expression and free press by inserting a payment notice to The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, when there's a road down here in Beijing, you'll find a few disgruntled voices and you won't see any real reflection of the missing opinions that Chinese citizens can have about the worrying economic trajectory of China, since the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers was wrong about the offer to publish" his article, but he didn't say the name of the publication.
Republicans separate women's voters before the mid-legislative elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, warn analysts
Since many of the major republics support and defend the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, which faces various demands for sexual aggression, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the next media elections.
The emotions surrounding these cases are extremely high, and most Republicans have already officially shown that they want to step forward with a vote.
These things can't be undone," Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, explained to The Hill for an article published on Sunday.
Reeher said that there's no doubt that the last hour's pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arisona) because a FBI investigation is going on is enough to calm angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesman of the progressive group MoveOn, Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters called "november is eating!" (november comes) while they appeared at the Senate's lobby while the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of the dragon. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
"Democratism and motivation will remain out of the picture," explained Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
"People say they've already been high; it's true.
But it could have been more, especially among female suburbs and younger voters from 18 to 29 years of age who often don't vote while they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, where he detailed his sexual assault requests to the Supreme Court's candidate, analysts suggested that a negative response could be made if the Republicans were to pressure the authorities to confirm it.
"This has become an embolism for the GOP," said Michael Steele, president of the National Committee of the Republican, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only the vote of the meeting or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh sits in the bank of the accused. It must also see how the Republicans have managed this issue and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of US Priorities, a group that helps to select democratics, in the news channel.
However, North Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's star and the witnesses of Kavanaugh, with the balance that slowly slows down to the last.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in the Ford witness in an injurious or likely way, while 35 percent claim to believe in an injurious or likely Kavanaugh.
In addition, some 38 percent said that he believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or injudgable during his witnessing work, while about 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's press, the FBI is currently investigating applications filed by Ford and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate's Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had raped him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court’s candidate taught him the genitals at a party while studying in Yale in the 1980 ’ s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the web inventor is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's Solid Open Code Platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's secret intention was "dominating the world."
"We have to do it now," he said about the company suddenly.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal data storage" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, pending tasks lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in a browser at that time.
What's exclusive from the personal online data store is that the user is the one who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personally personalized through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's delegate John Bruce, is that the company integrates adequate resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available for everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some developers in model contracts to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that none of his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely empty during the night.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a press release on Sunday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been a voice affecting the debate on network neutrality.
Even during Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Creature of the I GM Victory
The only cleric of the Church of England who won a Victory Creature during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel and vice-president Bernard Vann won the guard on September 29, 1918 for the attack in Bellenglishe and Lehacourt.
However, he was beaten by a franchise four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandsons were excommunicated by a memorial plaque in a parade on Sunday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "magnificently symbolic" that the leaf was presented exactly 100 years after his grandmother's watched project.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann directed his battalion by the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very heavy storm and under the intense fire of cannons and meteors."
Later he ran to the fireline and, with the "Maximum bravery" he made progress on the line before throwing himself over a canon with one hand and leaving at least three members of the highlight.
The Colonel was shot by a German franchise on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandmother's actions were a project that could never be equal, which makes you feel humiliated.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the explosion, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of an authentic hero is demonstrated by support that many people will receive.
The MMA fans who stayed out of bed all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead of her
Imagine you're awake all night to see Bellator 206 and you need to see the most important event.
San José's cartel contained 13 matches, including six of the main cards and had to be seen directly all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the meeting, the United Kingdom spectators were impressed when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed that they had spent the night waking up until the morning to see the battle.
A follower on Twitter described the change for animated drawings as "a kind of vomitous accompitation."
"The government's legislation says that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they changed to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Marquetting and Bellator's communication, when they asked him about the transmission.
"Peep the porridge, yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Cooker, said they would work in programming to include United Kingdom spectators in the future.
"I think that when I think about repetition, I think it can work," said Cooker.
"But there are six in the morning of a Sunday and we can't resolve it until Sunday at our hour, Monday at its.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I changed channels, there were a lot of messages coming and coming, and not everyone was happy.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to leave it in five fights, instead of six as usual, and we're trying to show it back to the followers, but it's over.
It's a desperate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" about sexuality
Olympic skipper Tom Daley says he's grown up feeling inferior to the rest of people because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to triumph.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't find out until he went to high school that everyone wasn't like him.
In the Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he talked about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a father was more important than winning the Olympics.
The usual presentation of the long-term programme, Kirsty Young, has taken several months down by disease.
Daley, who appeared as a nude to Laverne's first program, said he felt "less" to others because "he wasn't socially acceptable as children and girls."
He said, "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me power and strength to triumph."
I wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so I didn't disappoint anyone when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The twice winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used its image of the Games of the Communist Party in Australia to demand more countries that discriminate against homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any restraint and wanted to give others "hope."
The world trimester explained that he had fell in love with a man, North American performer, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "I was surprised."
Last year, Daley married the winner of an Oscar, 20 older than he, but he says the difference of age has never been a problem.
He says that when you're so young (participated in his first Olympic Games when he was 14 years old and his father died three years later) it's hard to find someone of the same age that he's experienced high and low.
The couple were parents in June of a child they named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "all his perspectives" have changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to get an Olympic gold," he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is also said to be his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father didn't agree that he had to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had already been in London 2012 because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell you "Father, you won't be there to take over the first line," he said.
"As long as I took his hand, he stopped breathing and wasn't until then, that he was already dead, that I finally agreed he wasn't invincible," he said.
The next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in some Olympic Games. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the three of his first songs (Proud de Heather Small), which he had heard during the preparation for the Olympic Games, and he still had his gallon skin.
Desert Island Discs is released at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
An Emperor Mikkelson introduced himself to Ryder Cup Saturday
North American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday playing his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his physical state if he doesn't want to become an unhappy girl.
Mickelson, who will participate in the binary event to score a record for 12 times, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for "fourballs" and "foursomes" on Sunday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has usually been for the United States, the winner of five main tournaments spends his time doing an animation and working in his field game, hoping to correct what's wrong with him.
He never made the direct drivers, not even at the moment of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for Le Golf National's hard-trajectory, where the long road tends to punish the missing times.
And if his own trajectory isn't boring enough, Mickelson, in the new Sunday party, will face the exact British Open Championship, Francesco Molinari, which has joined the Tommy Fleetwood Rocky to win the four parties this week.
If the North Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual parties, start strong, the Mickelson party could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, unable to tell him much more.
"He perfectly understood his role for that day, made me a palm on my back and rolled me around with his arm while he told me that I would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has great confidence in himself.
It's a famous salon and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I thought more about it, but that's how I trained, and that's how we think we should move forward.
He wants to be there, like anyone else."
On Sunday, Mikkelson will pass Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of Ryder Cup games played.
It can mean the end of a race to Ryder Cup that hasn't equalled its individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 victories and 7 empathies, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought intangibles to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, smiley, he likes to be proud of people and he's a big company for the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players also have fun staying with him this week, which has been fun to see.
Take a lot more out of your game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can soon be avoided
Thomas Bjorn, European Captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual dues of Ryder Cup's last day can easily be converted into a hard day.
The Danish started in 1997 in Valderram, when the team captained by Hise Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but finally they won the victory for the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"And continue to remember that we had a great advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but soon," Bjorn said, on the picture, after seeing the win of the 2018 team for 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, leaving the marker at 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story has taught me and all the team members that haven't finished yet.
Tomorrow you have to go to the whole machine.
You have to go out and do it all right.
This doesn't end until the points don't push the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I've already said it, I'm focusing on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also have those who are our rivals: the world's best players."
Fascinated by the performance of his players in a demanding golf field, Bjorn added: "I'll never be shocked by this.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow's individual performance will mark the difference and change everything.
It's great to be with a company when it's all right, but individual duels test your ability to play golf.
This is the message you have to deliver to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best of himself."
In contrast to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to do better individually than in team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three four points.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin on the mountains of the last day, since he became part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he lost the "Midnah Miracle" he won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," she answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the capital of 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
"In the morning we have 12 important parties, but we want to start with a good foot, as was seen in Brooklyn and Medinah.
When there's a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure generated in these central duels.
We've prepared the alignment based on circumstances and the best way to try to make magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start the rebellion against Rory McIllroy in the main depth, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of Europe in the first half of the order.
"I have chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities," Bjorn says about his selection for individual confrontations.
The new German warship, then again
The new flagship of the German Army would have ended in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it will not do so, at least until the year it comes to defective systems and cost increases, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class fleet, has been positioned until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which mentions a military carrier.
The ship should have joined the Army in 2014, but the problems behind the construction have marked the terms of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships that the Army was responsible for in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class fleets.
It is believed that it will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-anti-bukes and anti-bukes missiles, as well as technology against noise action, such as now a reduced, infrared radar and acoustic signatures.
Other outstanding features include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use new brakes for up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these continued delays imply that the advance vessels, which were expected to be able to design Germany as a powerful foreign force, will already be obsolated when they enter into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 was already reported last year, when the German Army rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss dragon in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Army returned a ship to the builder once released.
There are few details of the reasons why it has returned, but the German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship which made it unsustainable if it was used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, since about 120 mariners, half of the crew needed for the old Bremen class fleets, operate on Baden-Württemberg class ships.
Moreover, it has also been known that the ship's weight is too high, that it reduces its performance and limits the army's ability to add better futures.
It is believed that the 7000-ton Rhineland-Pfalz will weigh twice as much as class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes the training of the crew, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed that some $3.100 million ($3.600 million) surprises have come from an initial budget of €2.200 million.
The problems of the new fleets have become an issue of special importance, taking into account recent warnings indicating that Germany's maritime military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, has recognized that the Army "is staying without ships that can be used".
The officer said the situation got worse in time because they stopped using the old ships, but it wasn't given any more.
He has regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class's fractures could join the Army.
The National Foundation Exploites the Secret Life of the Rape · Global Voices
A new research carried out at an end of the Highlands of Scotland is aimed at discovering how the hostages use the landscape to feed themselves.
It is expected that discoveries can provide new data on the behaviour of these single flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists at the National Foundation of Scotland will continue to be held early and common, in addition to northern earpieces and water taps in Inverwe's Botanical Garden, located in Western Ross.
Special registries will be placed in key property locations to monitor the activities of the kidnappers during the station.
Volunteers and staff of the United Kingdom National Health Service will also carry out mobile polls with portable detectors.
The analysis of the sound of recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of the rappins and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habit will be created to create a detailed picture of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation adviser to the National Foundation of Scotland, expects results to show which areas of habit are more important for rappers and how they use each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands, and how to improve forest maintenance for reptiles and other associated species.
The population of hostages in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has decreased considerably in the last century.
Building and restoration tasks threaten the hostages, since they affect the kidneys and can cause loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning also pose a risk, such as the mathematical paper and chemical treatments used in construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Actually, the hostages aren't blind.
However, because of their hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a trap.
They use a sophisticated location technique by echo to place insects and obstacles that interfere with their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes very seriously the hostages.
He has ten experts with adequate training, who perform polls, baby inspections and, sometimes, usually rescued.
Even so, the organization has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to hostages at the Treve State Finca, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the land of eight species of Scotland rapper.
The finch administrator, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a big area for the hostages," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all a good habit.
But we still don't know many aspects of the hostages, so the work we do here and other properties will help us understand better what they need to grow."
Note the importance of verifying whether there has been seized before carrying out maintenance tasks in property, as it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single motherhood nest of more than 400 women and young people could result in the disappearance of a local population.
The hostages are protected and it's illegal to kill them, attack them, bother them and destroy the kids.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Conservative Foundation for the Rape, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said, "We still have to learn a lot of rappelants and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data about their population."
Ronaldo refuses rape charges while his lawyers prepare a complaint against a German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has indicated that the charges of rape against him are "false news" and has said that people "will become famous" thanks to his name.
Your lawyers will request the German weekly newspaper Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
The president of Portugal and the Youth has been accused of violating a state-owned woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Presumably, he paid at his time $375.000 because the incident wasn't made public, according to the information published by Der Spiegel yesterday.
In an Instagram Live video directed to its 142 million followers hours after the charges were made public, Ronaldo, 33 years old, said they were "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says the five-time winner of the Gold Pilot in the camera.
"You want to make famous thanks to my name.
It's normal.
They want to use my name to become famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything's in order," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers have already prepared the complaint against Der Spiegel for the charges, which have qualified as "inadmissible information from suspects about private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player will seek compensation for " Moral days for a corresponding import into the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most flagrant violations of personal rights in recent years".
The incident took place in June 2009 in a hotel and casino in Palms de Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he reportedly violated her personally, according to reports filed at the District Court of Clark, Nevada.
Majorga says Ronaldo got angry after the incident and told him he was a "99% good boy", except one "1%".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sexual relations, but they were allowed.
Majorga also said she went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but later she accepted an agreement outside the courts because she had "on behalf of the hostages" and was concerned about "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to cancel the deal, since she's still traumatized by the incident.
Ronaldo was about to shoot at the Royal Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident and this summer was shot by the Italian giant in a 100 million euros operation.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will always repent" of losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "will always regret it" if you lose the world leader status in post-Brexit manufacturing, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "an issue" that the UK's Toyota base in the United Kingdom had stated to the BBC that if the United Kingdom had left the European Union without reaching any agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in the case of an unaccompanied Brexit could cause loss of jobs.
Burnaston plant, which manufactures the models Auris and Aventis of Toyota, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My point of view is that if the United Kingdom comes out of the EU without agreement at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Out of the EU without agreement on how trade will work with the rest of the EU's countries has awakened the fear of other UK car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims that it will close Mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider to be risks in the Brexit production chain without agreement.
Toyota's production line is made on a "just in time" basis with pieces that reach every 37 minutes of United Kingdom suppliers and the European Union for car manufacturing.
If the United Kingdom comes out of the European Union without reaching any agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border, which the industry believes could cause delays and loss of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than one day at Derbyshire's plant, according to the company, and production would have to be stopped as a result.
Clark says that Theresa May Checkers' plan for future relations with the EU is "equipped precisely to avoid these border controls".
"We have to reach an agreement. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4.
"The tests not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue with a joint success of production chains."
Toyota could not confirm for how long the production would stop, but in the long run, she warned that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could cause loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the Union at the plant, said that members are beginning to be very concerned about the situation: "For experience, when these jobs are lost, they never return."
A government spokesman said: "We have developed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could go back
The expected meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could "bet a week" while continuing the fight on the appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in statements from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Russia and assistance to Trump and a possible obstacle to justice by the president.
Whether Trump is charged or not by the Attorney-General, he's been putting Mueller's independence at risk, he's fed the rums in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of holding a microphone to record talks with Trump and also the possibility of depositing the president with the 25th floor.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Sunday he went to the White House among those who were about to leave.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York, was announced on Sunday.
Trump stated that "no preference" would come upon Rosenstein, but the meeting was scheduled to avoid a meeting with the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee to which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation to the FBI about the charges against Kavanaugh, which further led to the vote of the whole Senate.
The Trump press secretariat, Sarah Sanders, appeared at Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "No date has yet been set, it could be this week, although it may be another week for all matters with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see. I always like keeping the press informed."
Some journalists might reject this statement: Sanders has not been in the White House since September 10.
The rapporteur, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions wasn't because he didn't like the fanfaronry of TV journalists, although he said, "I won't deny they're fans."
However, he indicated that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president has more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without quoting any source: "We have consulted these data."
Sanders has said that information sessions will continue to take place, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better to talk to me.
We often try to do it, you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and replace information sessions when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press rounds with signatories on his official visit.
Individual press routes are rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, after an informal appearance and, at some point, strange in front of the journalists assembled.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service about the fear of Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wants them to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter within six months of the EU's arrival.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to cover the cost of residence applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on output continued, and it seems to be heading towards the decisions expected this afternoon.
But the government of the United Kingdom has also begun preparations in the event of an agreement on a possible scenario.
I know it's time for all of you.
So I wanted to reiterate now that I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU companies, and beyond, provide valuable experience and destitution that strengthens and improves the health service, while benefiting from the patients and communities we are dealing with.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a reline of the Tennessee State Tigers, has undergone an emergency operation after having suffered an injury on Saturday night in the battle for 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The trainer of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, reported to the press that the injury occurred shortly before the middle.
"He came to the band line and exploded there," Reed said.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing it in a letter and carrying it in order to test it further.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris, from Nashville WSMV, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had emerged from the surgeon at Vanderbilt's medical center.
Harris added that "there's still no information about the type or scope of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's Abercrombie's first season, the second year, with Tennessee State after she left Illinois.
I had completed five Saturdays before I left the game, which made it a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax by buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax by buying a property in the United Kingdom with the additional money used to help people without getting paid in accordance with the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp tax will be recorded in those people who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom.
Hysenda expects to earn up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people.
It is expected that foreign buyers will be charged with a higher stamp tax by buying a property in the United Kingdom and these money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that affect the highest rates.
The increase in the stamp tax will be recorded in those people and businesses that do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom; these money will be directed to government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The overload, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second real estate and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
Hisenda hopes to get up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are residents who are not British, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up on the property scale.
Many well-being areas of the country, especially in capital, have become " Fantasma cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes up weeks after Boris Johnson has asked for a reduction in the pressure tax to help young people have their first place.
He accused the great constructions of maintaining high prices of property buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel off the shares on land available to correct Great Britain's real estate disaster.
Corbyn has announced a series of proposed real estate reforms, such as housing controls and the completion of "no blame".
He also wants to give more power to the meetings to build new places.
May said: "Last year I said I would devote my mandate to restoring British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Great Britain will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom as it is for businesses with their foreign counterparts to buy housing compared to British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a place in property is too far away and the indigence of people without land makes it even more real."
Jack Ross: "My Maximum ambition is to train Scotland."
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "most ambition" is being Scotland's coach at some point.
Scotland, 42 years old, has accepted the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which currently holds the third position in League One, at three points of leadership.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
They called me once as a support, and that's all," Ross said to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound program.
"But I grew up watching much playing Scotland with my father when I was young and it's always something that makes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I'm successful in training clubs, but."
Ross's predecessors in Sunderland trainer charge include Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's trainer says they don't feel the pressure to be next on a list of names dedicated to such a large team, after having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's offers.
"From now on, my criteria for measuring my success will be if I can make this team back to the First League.
With the club's structure and facilities, it is obvious that its place is the First League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd just think I've been successful here if I can make it back to the club."
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach in Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts' technical body.
He helped Alloa avoid falling into the third category and transformed St. Mirren into fighting for the salvation of champion champion champions the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"Probably it was a decisive moment," he recalled about accepting the charge to the Alloa.
"I always thought training was better given me than playing.
It sounded strange because I did it well, I got out reasonably, and I enjoyed pretty good times.
But playing can be very hard.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still dealing with aspects such as stress and pressure at work, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train, and now I'm doing it, is the most comfortable time I've ever heard since I'm an adult."

The perfect time for a painting is 17:30 a.m. on a Sunday, according to a study.
The summer heat wave has triggered consumption in the Great Britain bars with difficulties, but has added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and bars have achieved an increase of 2.7% in sales in July, but restaurant consumption has decreased by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA financial adviser, the company that has collected the data, says: "The continued hours of the sun and the participation of England in the world, which has increased more than expected, have made July follow a pattern similar to June, with an increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered more.
The reduction of 1.8% in consumption in June's restaurants has been implicated in July.
The bars and taverns, led by the consumption of beverages, have achieved the best results, while the consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we have consulted, the sales of drinks have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, of the opiate analysts and the RSM hotel, said: "These results continue to be the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Time and impact of major social events or sports continues to be the main factors related to external ocean market sales.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decline in sales of a 4.8% international would be particularly detrimental, rather than continuing pressure on costs.
This is so long and hot that it could not have come at a much worse time for the food business and time will tell us if the most moderate temperatures we had in August would provide this very necessary breath."
The total increase in bar sales and restaurants, including recent openings, has been 2.7% of July, as indicated by the encouragement in the presentation of brands.
The sales index of The Caffer Peach Tracker for United Kingdom restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of over 9 million pounds and is the sector's established reference point.
One out of five children has secret social networks that hide parents.
One of five children, some 11-year-olds, have secret social networks that hide parents and teachers, according to data from a survey.
An survey of 20,000 secondary students indicated an increase in "Insta false" pages
Newspapers have raised fear of sexual content
20% of students say they have a "primary" account that shows parents
One out of every five children, some 11 years old, create social networks that hide adults.
An survey of 20,000 secondary students has indicated a rapid increase in the "insta fake accounts", a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
Newspapers have raised fear of sexual content.
A 20 per cent of students say they have a net "primary" account they show to parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter saw a message from a teenager who urged others to "violent me."
Research, conducted by Digital Awarenness UK and the Committee of Private Schools Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools has revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, of which half have admitted to have private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elidh Doyle will be the "visit of athletes" in the directive of the Scottish Federation of Athletics
Eilh Doyle has been appointed Executive Director of the Scottish Association of Athletics Directive at the annual general meeting of the organisation.
Doyle is the field and track athlete with more Scotia medals, and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who lead sport to benefit from his outstanding international experience in the last decade.
"Eileh has respect for the community of Scotland's athletics, the United Kingdom and the world and we are sure that Scottish athletes will benefit from their inclusion in the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I've got a lot of desire to act like the voice of athletes and I hope I can make sport grow and contribute to Scotland."
The student, who won the gold in the 200th and 400th Olympic Games in 1996 in Atlanta, between a total of four Olympics and now a regular BBC commentator, was prevented from walking after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell me if I can recover or how much.
It's been exhilarating, but I've recovered from everything, I've learned to walk again, and today I'm going to play the agility exercise!
Thank you for the anim messages!"
An advertising tool that compares cows with cows divides their opinion on the Internet
A Tirallette company has shared the opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares the lactating sea with cows that are mutilated.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "first silencer that can be brought out of the world," the Elvie consumer technology company has issued an inspired announcement in a music video of jokes to show freedom that gives the new tyrantt to the sea.
Four real mothers dance in a granary full of fur and cows at the rhythm of a song that includes letters like, "Yes, I bow to myself, but you won't see any cats" and "Because if you didn't find out, they're not pregnant, but my pets."
The tournament continues: "Bombs, bombs, nadons, bombs, bombs, girls' munitions."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a range of reactions from those who have seen it, many of whom claim to show the "horrors" of the lactic industry.
"Very bad he decided to use cows to announce the product.
Like us, they have to stay pregnant and stop producing milk, with the difference they are separated from their babies a few days after they stop," wrote one person.
Elvie's Tirallet is discreetly hidden in a lactating support (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: "Probably traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why don't you use them to announce a tortoise for mothers who will keep their babies?"
Another user added, "It's an announcement out of place."
Other people defended the ad; one woman admitted that she found the song "was fun".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to give Mom.
Bombing for the Tirallet made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but it has to be taken as what it is.
It's a great product," wrote a user.
Another person commented: "It's a fun announcement for seams that bomb with Tirallettes (usually at their place of work or in the bathroom and feel like they're cows.
It's no announcement I'm reading or judging the lactic industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they've all jumped off with the trigger placed on the backside.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women feel like they are empty when they use the tract.
However, Elvie's Tirallet is completely silent, has no cable or tube and is discreetly attached to a lactating sustainer, giving women more freedom to move around, subjecting the nadons and, even, coming out during the bombing.
Ana Balarin, a wife and developer of Mother's first childhood, said: "The Elvie Tirallet is such a revolutionary product that deserves a shocking and provocative campaign.
By drawing the parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a tyrant is used and the challenges he's supposed to do, when we demonstrated, in a way that is both entertainment and educational, the incredible sense of freedom that the new tyrant offers.
It's not the first time the Elvie tyrant gets out of the news.
During the London fashion week, a mother of two children appeared on her front porch for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children, moved quietly to a camp of tents at the border of Texas
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although monthly entry across the border has virtually remained stable, partly because the rhetorical burden and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to escape.
Traditionally, most parents were immigrants without papers, who had been afraid to risk their ability to stay in the country if they decided to raise a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that possible parents and the rest of adults living in their countries will have to send digital press, which will share with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs control officer, testified before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to receive minors not accompanying them.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrests had no previous criminal records.
"About 80% of the people who have been arrested or lived in the land of a person who has been arrested are illegally in the country, and a large majority of them are criminal foreigners.
So we'll continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
In order to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new standards requiring some to present themselves to the court within a month after being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, in accordance with refugee workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, instead of attendance, to defend their case in order to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help will be deported immediately.
The more children are being kidnapped, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which may result in violent or refugee attacks, according to the workers and reports he's given to know the system in the last few months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns can be intensified in larger installations, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that due to its size, the signs of a child’s suffering are high.
They added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that many have already suffered.
Syria would urge the United States' "occupational forces" of France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country for eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "the issue will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must be removed immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that "the war of terror has practically ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced persons.
He said that Damascus would continue "to fight this sacred battle until we clear the whole Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of a country hit by war.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem stated that the conditions were good for his return and blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "unreasonable causes" that make refugees want to stay away from them.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing a subject that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral area after the last great wave of rebellion, Idlib, has improved the opportunity to continue with political encounters.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces with Russia's help in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has noted that the agreement has "clear terms" and has expressed the hope that military action will confront the Jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Nusra Front. bound to Al-Qaeda, which will "be radical".
Stefan de Mistura, sent by the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee formed by government members and the opposition to begin to profile a post-war constitution and prepare the way to the elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, the task of which should be restricted to "review the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump won the second time
According to this logic, Trump would again win the elections in 2020, which, as many liberal spectators are likely to expect, the scandals and the destruction process ended with its early presidency.
What would be, of course, "the end of a more dramatic presidency of history."
At the moment, no sign of fatigue is seen in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of audience audiences has doubled to 1.05 million to CNN and has been practically tripled to 1.6 million to MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in maximum hearing hours, from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show", from MSNBC, has led television audits by cable with up to 3.5 million viewers in the main information night.
"People have been denied because they don't understand it," says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC "Designed Survivor" series on a cabinet director who happens to be the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him I'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He answered me because I laughed at him," said Scovell.
There's a point of entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the guidance from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade if immigrant families can meet together and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going further when you're in the sixth hour to see a group of experts discussing the use that Bob Woodward made of sources "for private use" for his book "Make", Paul Manafort's leather jacket of 15,000 dollars ("a piece of rough clothes like his pride", titled Washington Post) and the terrible descriptions that Stormy Daniels made of, say, the anatomism of Trump.
In my case, I won't see Super Mario again.
"Part of what seems to be part of a tele-realization program is that every night it gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pown Stars about the changes in the characters and guided lines of the Trump program (to fight with NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
You can't let yourself lose any episodes so you stay back.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and it was just outside the house on the north coast of Kauai, but it was closed looking at the MSNBC while I recorded the CNN.
He couldn't get away with it, not with Brett Kavanaugh to face the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember making those then-out programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it would be a kind of joke, but it seems they were right."

The foreign money violates the course of the legislative media elections in the more adjusted House of Representatives
It is not surprising that there is an actual cash flow in Pennsylvania's 17th district, thanks to the construction of the congressional districts that made two current members compete for the same place.
This recent reassignment of the Pittsburgh Suburban District involves the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won the place in another district after some special elections last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, the republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently represented by the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is in conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were recast after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the former districts were disunited in an unconstitutional way for the Republicans.
The course for the new 17th district has launched a financial war between the main financial organizations of the parties, the Committee for the Democratic Campaign for the Congress (DCCC) and the National Republical Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb was named after Pennsylvania after an adjusted victory in a very follow-up election in March to represent the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District.
The Republicans have been in charge for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points of difference.
Political experts give the Democrats a little advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on Salvador for its support in China, but they withdraw it
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tight meeting with Panama's president, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his associates took out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of state diplomatic missions to Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "renewed decisions on the fact that Taiwan is no longer recognized," Heather Nauert, department spokesman, said this month.
However, only the possibility of punishing El Salvador, which received US$ 140 million in 2017, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvements, was considered.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on the emissions seen, would be detrimental to the Central American country and high numbers of deaths for murder and assault.
With the steps of the internal meetings, officials from both countries held a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar finding that continued last year and was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, high-level administration officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to be held, since it ended effectively with any likelihood of sanctions for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been elected for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration gives, according to diplomats.
The three state-level envoys discreetly returned to their posts in El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without heavy messages or sanctions by Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal debates since the anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also since the anonymity, confirmed his statements.
History Study
The next event to be performed could be the report of special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump to justice, of which there are numerous evidence in public records.
As you know, Mueller also researched whether Trump's campaign worked with Russia in his election attack.
If the Congress changes its hands, Trump could be found accountable to the organization, just when it is prepared to do so in front of the voters, and even before a jury of party members.
There are many circumstances, and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Trump, nor of any of its European human beings, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be taken on both Atlantic borders that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to do a coup against Hitler, only if the Western block had resisted it and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of concern as this and accelerates or slows down the inevitable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing a number of points of concern at the present time.
What if Trump's committed Rod Rosenstein, the deputy general prosecutor, the man who controls Mueller's investigation target?
Rosenstein has been on the shore since this newspaper reported that last year, he suggested secretly registering the president and speculating that it was not appropriate for the charge.
Rosenstein says the information of the Times is not necessary.
"How do we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair, or if it is confirmed by the Supreme Court despite the credible allegations of sexual abuse and false witnesses?
And, in particular, will we vote in the middle of a Congress that will be responsible for Trump?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will begin to run out of danger.
But I don't think we'll fail because I've learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew deported to Auschwitz for the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to burn Shabbat's mirrors on that table with the vase.
With this luggage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans, of the Rangers, the best face to the game against the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers repatriated Vienna's Speed Sunday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive empire in the Villa-real field this month, would leave him in a good position to classify himself into the Group of G of the European Union.
An injury on the knee prevented mercenary Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until the empath 2-2 against the real Villa, but you think Rangers can use this result as a trap to get great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because Villa-real is a good team," said the player, aged 31.
"We played the game believing that we could get a valuable result and we went out with a point.
Maybe we could've done something more at the end, but, in general, maybe the empath was just a result.
They were better in the first place, but we were better than in the second.
On Sunday, it's another big European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it'll be a hard game because they took a good result from the last game, but I'm sure we'll give it all and get a good result with the support of the office.
Last year it was really hard, with injuries I suffered and changes in the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team's fine and the boys enjoy it, the training's good.
I hope we can give it all back to the past season and be successful."
Women lose their voice for fear of rescue for marriage
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of them, few people talked to the family.
About half of respondents at national level say they have spoken to their long-term payout partner.
Only 10% of the investigators say he's talked to the kids.
"People want some family to take care of them, but they don't dare to raise it," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the nationwide life insurance company.
We need to start over here.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You can’t prepare your family for it because you care if you don’t talk about your wishes with sufficient caution.
Work with your assistant and your family to decide where and how to get attention, since these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial adviser in the conversation: It can also help you determine how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term funding options for your long-term care may include a long-term care insurance policy, an effective hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover your expenses or a own insurance with your own resources, if you have the money you need to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut back on legal battles.
You're looking for a representative to appoint a trusted person who oversees your medical attention and ensures that professionals come up with your wishes if you can't communicate.
Consider, too, the possibility of contracting a noticeable acquisition for your finances.
You should select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't forget the details: Imagine your former family member has a medical emergency and he's on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about drugs and allergy?
Please specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor to be determined, but also what doctors you want to deal with," Martin said.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready."
A man shot several times with a compressed plane in Ilfracombe
A man has received several cuts from a compressed air spat while he was home after he left for the night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the area of Oxford Grove d'Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdominal and arm.
Officials described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 in the morning (in the British summer time), as an "alternative act".
The victim hasn't seen his attacker.
His life is not threatened by injuries, and the police have made a call to find witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died of a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities. It is expected that the number of dead increases.
Since communications are cut, aid units have not been able to obtain information about the kingdom of Doghea, an area in the north of Palu near the earthquake epicenter of 7.5 magnitude.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important data on Palu and Doghara, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Cèlebes Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western side of the island of Cèlebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donghura is a kingdom that is more than 300 km from the coast to the north-west of the island of Chelebes.
The kingdom, an administrative region lower than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the Province of Central Celebes, particularly in the coastal region of Doghara.
The mining of coal is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the coast of the rest of Celebes.
Palu and Donghaa have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Doghea.
In 1996 there was also a tsunami in the west of Doha that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located at the Pacific Fire Center and is often produced by earthquakes with certain frequency.
The main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are listed as follows:
2004: On 26 December, a large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ace in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes affected the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most popular island, and caused a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-size earthquake struck a pop area in the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Isles of Mentawai, on the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters to destroy dozens of villages and kill about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the kingdom of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population remembered the earthquake and the death tsunami in 2004.
This time, no tsunamis occurred, but more than 100 people died from the earthquake.

The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists trapped temporarily.
The great son of Sarah Palin arrested with charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's governor and candidate to the Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested with charges of aggression.
Palin, 29 years old, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as suspects of domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report and resistance to arrest, according to a report published on Sunday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a constable tried to call the police to file charges, he pulled out his phone.
Palin is detained at the Matt-Su's temporary detention centre, where he is held with an unsecured bond of 500 USD, according to KTUU.
He compared himself to the court on Saturday, when he said "not guilty," when he was asked how he was declared, according to this chain.
Palin faces three missing classes A, which means he could go to jail for a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also accused of a lack of class B, which can be punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
It's not the first time criminal charges against Palin are registered.
In December 2017 he was charged with arresting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic aggression, interference with the report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon in a state of emergency in relation to the incident.
Her husband declared that he had given her a piece of punishment in his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans to associate her son's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
The 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of places.
Electricity and communications networks do not work and are expected to increase the number of deaths over the next few days.
The earthquake has just occurred on the coast of Central Celebes, in the northeastern of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social networks are circling videos at the time of impact.
Hundreds of people met at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim an exceptional death penalty for a suspect of the terrorist attack in New York
New York's federal prosecutors demand the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, reportedly used a Home Depot rental truck to bring about an attack on a bicycle train from the West Side Highway, to Lower Manhattan and round up fans and cyclists during his trip, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intensely" and that "intensely" caused serious personal injuries, in accordance with the intention of applying for the death penalty presented in the South New York district.
Both crimes could be punishable by death, according to the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a major federal jury attacked Saipov with 22 missing charges including eight charges of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in cases of mafia, in addition to a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claimed that the attack required a "relevant planning and premeditation" and described the way Saipov acted as "inhuman, cruel and abusive".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci," according to the intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's South District brought a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but finally he was sentenced to eternal imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to put an end to spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs died on the power grid on June 19, 1953.
According to the court's documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show any repentance in the days and months after the attack.
The police explained that he had told the researchers that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the charge letter, Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to put an end to the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also requested the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
It has been declared innocent of the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public prosecutors representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the charge's decision.
"We consider that the decision to apply for the death penalty, rather than accept a declaration of guilt and a perpetuityless chain of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defence team had previously applied for the taxpayers who did not apply for the death penalty.
Member of Parliament of the Conservative Party states that NIGEL FARGE should be put in charge of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised "moving popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative Party's conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians should "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of the very members of Theresa May parliament suggested that negotiations with the EU should be led.
Conservative without charge Peter Bone told Birmingham that the United Kingdom would already be outside the EU if Mr Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May at the time of conciliating her deeply divided ranks was highlighted when conservators in favour of the union were present in another protest against Brexit in La City.
The first minister is fighting to preserve his Chechers' compromise plan between Brexit's attacks, the Union's parties and the EU's.
The others insist that it will reach agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and press the Eurosceptics and the Conservative Party to choose between their package and the chaos.
Mr. Bone told the meeting Leave Means Leave of Solihull that he wanted to cancel the Chechers compromise.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd be out already,' he said.
Members of the Wellingborough Parliament added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to cancel the Chequers commitment."
To clarify their opposition to the EU, he added: "We have not fought world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that said the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay there is completely false."
The Conservative Party of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said in front of the reporters: "I just tell you, first minister, that you listen to people."
"The commitment of Chechers is unpopulated among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopulated between our party and our activists, who are the people who get out of the street and get us to win elections.
Leave Chechers' commitment and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said that the meeting politicians must feel the pressure if they want to make the decision at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of confidence between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to get Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let them."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the political class, while bringing Brexit, feel the pressure."
"We are mobilized by the popular troops of this country who have given us victory with Brexit and we won't rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Union's players made a trip to Birmingham before a two-hour meeting at the city center.
A small number of activists were acting flagged against the Conservatives against Brexit after the group was launched this week.
The Conservative Member of the House of Lords Adonis laughed at the conservators for the security problems they had suffered with a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can have the necessary IT systems and all technology for Canada's agreement more, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete façade.
There is no option for a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to consider the possibility of submitting himself as a candidate to the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will consider submitting himself as a candidate to the president after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, Massachusetts's democracy spoke about its future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is presented for his re-election in November against the representative of GOP Geoff Diehl, who was Vice-President of the Marchausetts campaign in Trump in 2016.
It was a speculative center on the possibility of bringing Trump back in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents with open-ended meeting format since Trump took up his job.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to present himself as a candidate to the presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the bathroom."
A person arrested for death by Sims from LSU
Baton Rouge's police announced Sunday that a suspect for death was arrested from LSU Wayde Sims' basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the 20-year-old Dayteon Simpson arrest at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They published a video of the shooting on Friday night and asked for collaboration to identify the man in the subway.
Sims, 20 years old, got shot and died near the Southern University campus in the morning.
"Wayde Sims got a hit on his head and finally killed him," began police officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday at the 247sport media.
Wade tried to defend his friend and got a Simpson deal.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being in the scene, having a gun, and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and was taken to custody at the East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 parts with 10 beginners during the last season and had a mean 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 bounces per game.
Russia's Great Prize: Lewis Hamilton gets world title after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since the time Valtteri Bottas stayed in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of Mercedes' team would play an important role in the road.
From the Polish position, Bottas had a good start and nearly shot Hamilton while he defended his position for the first two times and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel entered the boxes before and let Hamilton run with the transit to the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop at boxes and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton progressed after a certain wheeled action that caused Ferrari's pilot to leave the inner part free with the risk of staying out after a double movement to defend the third row.
Max Verstappen started at the last row of the grid and at the end of the first time he was in the seventh position on his 21st anniversary.
Next, he continued in good standing most of the way, since he kept his routes to save time, to advance to Kimi Raikkonen and to move to the fourth.
He finally entered the boxes around 44, but he couldn't increase the rate by the next eight times, and Raikkonen was in fourth position.
It's a hard day, because Valtteri did a great job all week long and was an honest gentleman who told him to let me through.
The team did a great job to have a u-do" said Hamilton.
His body language was terrible
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein at a Saturday meeting to insist that she did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused the candidate to the Supreme Court of Sexual Abuse Brett Kavanaugh.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee, but commented that what was happening at the Senate proved that people were "bad, cruel and lying".
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's going on in the last days at the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry, mean, cruel and lying people," he said.
"When you look at the comms and the filtrations and they say, "No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... you filter the document? "Hey, what?
No, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... no, we didn't filter it." He added while he was imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing his statements against Kavanaugh from Ford in July and was filtered in September, but Feinstein denied that his office's filtration was in progress.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein explained to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to be confidential and I kept it confidential, as he asked me."
But his rejection did not please the President, who commented at the meeting on Saturday night: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defence of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of inadequate sexual conduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using their own statements.
"They are determined to regain power for the necessary means.
You see the evil, the cruelness, doesn't matter to those who do wrong, to those who have to struggle to have power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer marked two bullets for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the victory of Friday at Elite against the Belfast Giants, since they won the game of return from 5 to 3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately gained a double advantage thanks to the finals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their team, but, later, Dwyer restored the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard was equal to the Dundee, and then two bullets from Lucas Lundvald Nielsen assured his victory.
It was the third victory of the season at the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who came to win the Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast Friday.
It was the fourth find of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand at 3:35, from Kendall McFaull's assistance. Four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assistance, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this initial period of activity, Sullivan re-positioned the home team at 13:10 a.m. before Matt Marquartt eased the equivalent at 15:16.
Dwyer guaranteed the advantage of the Giants at the first break when he got the second round of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to its level with a powerful gol at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the advantage for the first time during the game at the end of the second part and guaranteed the victory of their team with the five goal near the end of the game.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five parties, are home to Milton Keynes and have their next party Friday.
Aeroplane controller dead to save hundreds of passengers from a earthquake
An Indonesian air controller turned into a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers safely landed.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a great earthquake struck the island of Celebes in the morning and triggered a tsunami.
There's a lot of Replica in the area and there's a lot of people trapped between the ruins in the city of Palu.
But even though his associates escaped to save his life, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place at the Tremulous Control Tower at Palu Mutiara Six Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in his place to make sure that Batik's flight 6321, which was on the track at the time, could take the flight safely.
Then he got out of the air traffic control tower when he thought he was getting bored.
He died later at the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a Balikipan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"This has broken our heart," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has announced that access to the cities of Doghana, Sig and Butung is limited.
"It is expected that the number of deaths will increase because there are still many bodies under the run and there are many who have not been able to access," said the representative of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency.
The waves, with an elevation of up to three feet [6 m], destroyed Palu, which will celebrate a common funeral on Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying help and delays.
Risa Kusumuma, a 35-year-old mother, explained to Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance is a dead end.
The potable water is scarce.
All the minors have been kidnapped."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, explained to the CNN: "The Indonesian Red Creu works against clocks to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still inspire."
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo came to Palu on Sunday and said to the armed forces: "I ask you all who work day and night to complete all the occupation-related tasks.
You're ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini says now that a man has disappeared after the accident in the truck
The airline that operated a flight that was going to take place in a Pacific area in Micronesia now says that a man has disappeared, although it was previously said that the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a communiqué that they had not found a passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find it.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane fell into the water while trying to land at the airport of the Chuuk Islands.
The authorities reported on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said there were still six passengers on Saturday at the hospital and everyone was in good condition.
The exact cause of the accident and the sequence of events is still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Marine said the plane was flying to the dock because the track was short.
Some witnesses think that the plane went up the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was very low.
"That was extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the other passengers were able to walk with water through the belt to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said that the volunteers had panicked and began shouting, and he suffered a stroke on his head.
The U.S. Navy said that mariners who were working near to improve a mollusc also helped in the rescue with an inflatable ship to transport people affected to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters in the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that 111 people died in plane accidents recorded in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composed of a night's chronology that burned a woman alive
The tax office concludes on Saturday in the review of the trial of a man accused of cremating a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described the jury as using mobile phone records to build the charges's movements, 29 years old, Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received data from various mobile phones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his previous statements, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying, since his truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis claimed that he had been there for about two weeks who knew Chambers when he died.
The telephone records indicated that they had only been in contact for a week.
Rowlett said that, some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted text messages, calls and contact information from Chambers' phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defence plans to start its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he was hoping that the trial would take place in the hands of the jury on the same day.

They want to go back to their roots and put the hip-hop conscious again.
Some artists, such as The Refugees and Commons, have lived a recent resurgence to the United Kingdom by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY Monday requires a couple to complain after a "racist" message
A New York mayor accused a couple of a discriminatory complaint after receiving a negative text message from the mother where she was protesting because she was "another black person."
The couple refuse to be racist and compare the demand with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed frustration at seeing that the new Monday, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived to work on the first day of 2016.
"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOA OTHER NEGRA PEOPLE," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After learning of her pipfia, a "unfriendly" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman charged Mrs. Maurice, alleging that the lady who had come by, who was an Afro-American, had done her job badly and she was expecting a Filipino person, in accordance with the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding payment on her day of work and then sent her home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice claims a compensation for the commission and claims a compensation of approximately US$ 350 per day for work with a six-month residence for which she was hired, although there was no contract.
"I want to show them that things can't be done like this," he explained to the Post on Friday morning, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple replied to the statements that they were racist all saying that Maurice's commission was the most reasonable one, because they were afraid they could not trust her after she had given up.
"My wife sent him something he didn't mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racist people," said the husband, Joel Plasco, at the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been hunting with, even if it was wrong?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the demand with "extortion," said that his wife had two months left to have a baby and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue such a thing?
It's not a very kind attitude," added the investor banker.
The legal case is not yet resolved and the court of public opinion has insisted on accusing the couple of social networks and condemning their behaviour and logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not be identified with a voice talking, according to a new card
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in relation to the letter: "It's hard to put herself in place of someone who tied it for the first time before his publication.
Thank you very much, now we know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before he had the inspiration to write the book about a little fur dog, was optimistic about the book's rebirth. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agreolç", after his death last year.
Describe Paddington as a very important member of his family and say his father was not very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a suspect," he said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was practically like when your son got something: proud of you, even if it's not yours.
I think he considered Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, I always recognized Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dead and I had to say goodbye by phone
When they landed, they took their daughter to Nizza's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where the doctors worked there to save her life.
"Nad called often to say it was too hard and they didn't expect it to be too much," began Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I called Nad and said I would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The medications they gave him because his continued body was eating and getting out of his system.
He had died before I was scheduled and so everything was closed.
I just had to sit and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family members and others.
I had to keep the good shapes."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now in pain for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of passengers, away from the experience that was going on.
"No one knew," he said.
"He had his head cut and the tears didn't stop falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of sympathy for Nad accommodating.
The feeling I needed my love and my understanding.
I know I wanted her so much."
Doll women get cards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been holding cards at a galley bridge with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that citizens can call for help.
Miss Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, he was killed.
"I don't want no father or mother to feel what I have to hear every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, living in Lydney, said his son was a boss-in-chief with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile could light any room."
However, he left his job before he died because he was in a very dark spot.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after his own life.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm still worried there's a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "because people know that there are people who can be reached, who can listen, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet: you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who was Mrs. Davies' friend years ago, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"He never said he wasn't well, nor was he depressed or anything like it," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change of attitude.
He played background on Christmas day when the children opened their gifts and he didn't look at them in the eyes or anything."
He said his death meant a great trauma for them, but they had to work: "Open a hole in the family.
It destroys us.
But we have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is expected by a line while the FBI is starting an investigation
"I thought if we could get something like what he asked for (an investigation with an area and a limited time), we could get a certain unit," said Mr. Flake on Sunday. He also added that he was afraid that the committee would be destroyed by the dead end of the party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republicans want an FBI investigation?
His reticence has to be seen with the moment.
Only five weeks are required for the half-command elections on November 6. If, as expected, the Republicans do not get good results, they will be weakened in time to get that man who wants to leave elected to the main court.
George W. Bush has been taking the phone to call the senators and press them to pick up Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as she was his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI believes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to hand over the case and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea's "cau" deserters with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un reached power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, alleging data from the Ministry of the South Union, said 1,127 deserts had occurred last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in prices for human trafficking had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Normally, the vast majority of North deserters are offered the nationality of South Korea.
The sources of Seoul say that over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers illegal migrants, instead of refugees, and often repatriates them by force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are technically still in war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to keep talks focused on the negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work to achieve a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed US sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not first unilaterally disarm ourselves," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and is not fit to work at the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority of the House of Nancy Pelosi said that the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and that his temper was his inability to work at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in a Sunday interview at the Texas Festival Tribunal held in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted this way, she'd be told she's a "historic," said Pelosi in relation to her reaction to the witness of Kavanaugh's before the Sunday Court of Justice.
Kavanaugh, excited, rejected the allegations of sexual abuse by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh showed himself very excited, sometimes crying and remaining silent while talking about his family and his years at school.
He also explicitly condemned the Committee's democracies and said that the charges against him were a "grotesc murder and coordinated murder of a person" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s witness showed that he could not work at the Supreme Court because he had shown his prejudices against the democratics.
"I think he has qualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed reticences when he was asked if he would try to impose Kavanaugh's election, if it is confirmed, and if the Democrats get most of them in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not only capable of being at the Supreme Court, but not at the court where it is now," Pelosi commented.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge at the Court of Appeal for the District Circuit of Colombia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh might take against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe case against Wade, since it was considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he failed to ask questions about whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be annulled.
"It's not the time when a historical and harmful person enters the Tribunal and hopes we look wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a justifiable diarithria: months and years of enough cold and can't take it out without crying.
"We'll cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's going to be very common.
He continued... "I was very helpful to a woman who was an executive in some place who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and began to cry, tell the person who spoke to her: "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he went on.
I felt brilliant."
The tears are permitted as a result of anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in a office with a majority of men, where once I ended up crying with an unreceptive anger, is the woman's bigger (a cold directive that had always terrorized me a little) who took me from the wheelchair and dragged me up to the eye of the scale.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they'll have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a democratic member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarital adventure on a ship called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of presenting herself as a candidate to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision," she told me while she reigned 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates on the street and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone said, "Blancanue and the seven noses."
Since he was late in the campaign, he went back with the fund-raising, so he promised he wouldn't get into the race if he didn't get $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his players, who gave $1,000 to men, were only willing to give him 250 to her.
"Do you think I have an accident?" he asked.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so impressed by the emotions (thanks to the people who had helped him, frustrated with the system for the difficulty of getting money and directing himself to the voters, instead of doing it to the delegates, and anger, and sexism) that remained without words.
"It might have thought I had a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the press's reaction.
"It might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking, "What are they gonna put on my grave?"
"Are you crying?"
How the US-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The initial savings of the trade war between the United States and China were overwhelming and, although it doesn't seem like the war to end soon, a distance may result in long-term benefits for Beijing, according to experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued his first warning at the beginning of this year when he imposed taxes on China's major exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminium.
The most significant climb took place this week, with new oranges affecting products worth $200,000 million. These oranges represent a tax rate over half of all the goods arrived in the United States from China.
Pekin has been attacked each time in the same way and has recently raised five to ten percent of US dollars' worth of goods.
China has committed itself to replication the US, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will be back close.
Making Washington behaves back in front of a few requests, but going publicly before the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's President.
However, experts say that, if Beijing plays its letters well, the pressures of the US trade war could benefit China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start a fall in any of these countries is much more dangerous than the witnesses had foreseen," says Abigail Grace, an associate research associate in Asia-centre for New American Security, a committee of experts.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria said it was prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and asked for help to rebuild the country, destroyed by a war of more than seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Actually, the road situation is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their maintenance are complex.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country who need humanitarian help.
Al-Moulem stated that the Syrian regime is grateful for any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he pointed out that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that funded insurgents.
Europe's Selection Gets Victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's 2018 Ryder Cup election has won the North American election with a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The US has already lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European election won the crown again when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team arrived at 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The North American star Phil Mickelson, who fought during most of the tournament, pulled out the time of coming out of the water at the hole by 3, 16, which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone on all his series and became one of the four players who got 5-0-0 since he started the current tournament format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was separated by a 5&4 player with less qualified European selection Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, turned into the greatest winner the tournament ever had, with 25.5 points of career.
"I don't just cry, but today I can't avoid it.
It's been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have recovered my coat.
The team is the most important... and I'm glad I could help," started an emotional Garcia after European victory.
Pass the link to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the North American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost the four parties he had in France and now has a race record at Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistical for one of the best players who ever existed, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The North American election fought all week to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
North American Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's frustrated performance: "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
This morning there was a time when we had a European election.
We're fighting.
I'm taking the bar for Thomas.
It's a big capitulation.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, we'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been able to.
There's a way to get the bar.
He beat us."
Red Sea Update: The concentrations are reduced to Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The last report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general reduction of red sea concentrations in certain parts of the Tampa bathing area.
According to FWC, there are reports of more widespread proliferation conditions in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier areas, which suggests a lower concentration.
The distribution of the Red Sea is about 200 km from the coast, north of Pinellas to the accounts of the south of Lee.
You can find taks at 16 km from Hillsborough's account, but in less places, compared to the situation last week.
The Red Sea has also been observed in Pasco County.
Medium-cost or distance of coastal concentrations have been reported in the Pinellas county over the past week, high-cost and high-cost concentrations in the Hillsborough county, low-funded or higher in the Manatee county, medium-funded in Charlotte county, high-cost or low-cost concentrations in the Lee county, and low-cost concentrations in the Collier county.
They continue to report respiratory irritation to the county of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
No respiratory irritation has been reported during the last week in northeastern Florida.
