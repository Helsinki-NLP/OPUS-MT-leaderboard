The vice-president of the Brazilian presidential cabinet is brought before the court
On March, a federal judge accepted the charges brought against the former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet for assuming its involvement in a massive corruption scheme on Petrobras State oil company.
The federal prosecutor's office said Jose Dirceu will be sent to court for the allegations of corruption, promotion and money laundering brought this month.
Ten more people will be judged, including Joao Vaccari Neto, former treasurer of the Workers' Party, located in the power of Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, former president of Petrobras companies.
The Director is the oldest member of the Labour Party in the government in custody of relations with this scheme.
The director served as head of the cabinet of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested at the beginning of August, where he is already under house arrest, with an 11-year sentence for involvement in a ten-year contract for the purchase of votes in Congress over the last 10 years.
The prosecutors stated that the Director has developed the Petrobras harvest scheme, accepted the harvest while it is in operation and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after it was closed at the end of 2013 for the polling scandal.
According to the prosecutors, the Petrobras scheme involved approximately $2 billion in the form of half- and other illegal funds.
Part of that money would have been returned to the party's campaign fund at the government and its allies.
It would also have included half to Petrobras's directors in exchange for contract contracts.
The "miraculous" recovery of a survivor student of the Peshawar massacre
A paralysed teenager after being shot four times in the most complete terrorist attack in Pakistan has succeeded in a "miraculous" recovery after following treatment in the United Kingdom.
Mohammed Ibrahim Khan, 13 years old, says Pakistan's doctors will never be able to walk again.
At least 140 people, most of the children, were killed when armed men attacked the public school in Peshawar last December.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for surgery, will be out of the hospital later.
Just nine months ago, in a typical morning of March, Mohamed was sitting at the first aid hour and listening to his professors.
Right then, seven armed men burned into the uniforms of the security officers entered the public school of the army.
It was a simple mission: to kill all the men, women and children who went out the way.
"I can't forget what happened that day," says Mohamed with a look.
I was sitting in the amphitheater, asking questions... then I heard guns out there.
The terrorists entered and began to kill. Our professor was burned alive.
Mohamed describes how he took four students out of the amphitheater while the carnage takes place.
Then she says she heard her friend, Hamza, shouting at him.
He said, "Oh, brother, save me."
I held him by my hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he was in the head.
Most of those who were killed in the attack were students.
Hamza died in Mohamed's arms.
Mohamed recalls that immediately after this he went down and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the chest down.
Peshawar doctors from northern Pakistan, then those from Rawalpindi, almost capital, told her family that there was no treatment and that she could never go.
"When I saw him, I felt my soul came out," says Sher Khan, Mohamed's father.
Those nine months were the worst of my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son so passionately critical will never be able to use his legs again.
They launched a campaign and asked for help from Pakistani television, attracting the support of some famous people like Iran Khan, who became a political critic.
Finally, they managed to fund Mohamed in the United Kingdom and offer him treatment at the private clinic Harley Street in London.
The neurosurgery consultant Irfan Malik described Mohamed as "removing" when he arrived at the hospital.
"He spent the last [some] months in bed, without being able to move from one side to the other," says Malik.
He was weak, he put much pressure on his back.
It wasn't in a very good shape.
A Vertebre from the base of Mohamed's vertebral column was destroyed
Mohamed was shot in the shoulder, left and back during the attack, and the lower vertebral column was destroyed, leading to paralysis.
However, during a six-hour operation, Malik and his team managed to re-read the nerve endings and rebuild the destructive part of the colony.
Even Malik was surprised by what happened next.
Just a week after the operation, Mohamed grew up and began to take steps and walk.
We didn't expect such a good outcome.
It was a miracle," she says.
Within less than two weeks of the operation, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and start the long recovery process.
Mohamed challenged the order and began to go again
He wants to become stronger and continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
But it's decided to return to Pakistan, get involved in the army and fight terrorism.
"I feel like I still have a chance of life," he says, showing pictures of weapons drawn by him next to school manuals and styles
Physically, Mohamed becomes increasingly stronger every day, but the psychological trauma he's going through and now is unimaginated.
"My fever didn't fall," he testified.
In my school, small children were killed.
What crime did they commit?
His mother cried out to him, kissed him, and said, "I see my son going away again."
He'll be able to keep saving his life.
The 4G service "Super Voice" from Three offers better signal
Three uses a 4G spectrum with a higher frequency, which can cover a wider area
The three mobile phone provider has launched a service in the United Kingdom saying you will improve reception within buildings and rural areas without signs.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a spectrum with a higher frequency.
And other networks intend to introduce the same technology, known as "Voice Over Long-Term Evolution (VOLTE)".
This is currently only working with Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the following months.
Three points out that up to 5.5 million customers will have access to service by 2017.
Chief Technology Officer Bryn Jones said: "By the end of the year, one million of our clients will have access to better coverage inside and they will be able to use their phones in more places than ever."

It reveals the secrets of their ghosts to BBC Breakfast.
Steven Wilson: "If I don't do anything, I feel guilty"
Steven Wilson has recently been appointed the great winner of the Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson has been named many times as the most professional musician in the world of progressive rock.
The musical talent won three prizes at Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, including the award for the best album of the year for Hand.
In its five star review, The Guardian called the album "an intelligent, expressive and captivating art opera".
Since the 1980s, Wilson has been the engine of many musical projects, the most famous of these being the Porcupine Tree Rock Team.
Now, before two shows with the house closed at Royal Albert Hall, Wilson only launchs a double LP in vinyl format, Transience, to show the "most accessible" range of his solo activities.
He told the BBC about his love for wines and his load program and explained how the comedy actor Matt Berry came to open his show.
What does vinyl mean to you?
I grew up right at the end of your vinyl era, and I remember that when we were just waiting for the CD to appear, because vinyl was so energizing.
You bought a disc, you went home with him, had a cut, and you had to bring it back.
I love CDs, and for some types of music, for example classics, they're better than wines.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there is nothing you can really value anymore.
Having a vinyl is like having a nice table set up in a sweater.
It's something you can hold in your hand while you're absorbed by verses and complex by the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but it doesn't have any way of being like this if some kids too young to remember vinillas like this kind of experience.
Do you have any wine you especially need?
I admit I got rid of all the wines in the '90s.
All the wines I bought again.
I started with the idea of re-establishing the collection I had when I was 15 years old, but I went beyond that.
The first disc I convinced my parents to buy was Out of the Blue from the Electric Light Orchestra.
If I had still had the original copy, it would have had emotional value, but, unfortunately, it's somewhere through a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes the album will be a port to possible new fans.
Why did you launch your new Transience compilation on vinyl?
This was originally designed as an idea for the Day of Disclosures, but I missed the occasion.
My speech house suggested that I give some of my shortest and most accessible songs.
I've come to be easily obsessed with the idea of doing something like "introduction into Steven Wilson's music" and I've kept the project open only on vinyl.
Who buys the vinyl also receives, and a variant downloaded to a high resolution.
Are you worried that the album won't show your music in her real light?
No, because, although I'm focusing on longer music, there's one thing I've always valued more than anything: the melodic part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that focuses more on technical complexity than on the melodic field.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all ages, has passed the time test because they have always put emphasis on the melodic side and the atmosphere.
What are you preparing for Albert Hall's show?
I don't want you to reveal too much.
The repertoire will be completely different every night.
First, there'll be a version of the show Hand. Erase. which I had this year, but on steroids, with some guests.
The second night it'll be more like an invasion in my history, this being more directed to the fans who have followed me over the years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open your show on the second night?
And me and the rest of the tournament team are great fans of the [channel 4 comedy series] Toast of London, until we give it all the time from it.
I was thinking about listening to Matt's music, so I bought him the album, Music for Insomniacs.
I talked to him about our common love for Mike Oldfield and asked him to sing at Royal Albert Hall.
I think I'm extremely lucky to have him open.
You re-examined the albums of bodies such as XTC, Tears for Fears and Yes.
How much does it affect your own music?
I don't get excited about this, but it's inevitable when you build these classic albums, they keep in mind.
My last album alone, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was undoubtedly the most progressive old school album I've ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that I remixed King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all year ago.
The current album, Hand. Erase., is much more open, because we worked at Tears for Fears and XTC.
Many times you're described right to the most professional progressive rock musician.
Is that how you feel?
You can remove the progressive word.
I think I'm probably one of the most obsessed people in the world of music today and I'm not saying this with pride, because, please believe me, it's a mess.
I think I inherited this from my father, who has a record of incredible works of power.
If I don't do anything all day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why work at remixtures was a gift, because it means I don't have to do all the time just my music.
The music industry is a hard place to do your career.
Now I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a prophecy.
I work every day and I'm not rich, but I live well.
I love what I do, it's a privilege, but if I were lonely I wouldn't have survived.
The transition will be launched in the United Kingdom on 25 September.
Steven Wilson will sing at Royal Albert Hall on 28 and 29 September, as part of his European tournament 2015-2016.
A new contract restores jobs to Skytrans
New Skytrans regrouped a part of the airline's staff who lost their job when old Skytrans failed.
Skytrans, a company in north Queensland, contributed $25 million to transport the QGC natural gas undertaking, which meant 18 members of the team and got back to work.
Skytrans, a owned company owned by the Wild family, became very active in January, after Newman’s government rewarded the subsidised routes that form a large part of the airline’s business.
The failure made more communities face an isolated potential, and Warren Entsch, a national-liberal federal parliament for north Queensland, was the representative voice of the national-liberal government's criticisms.
Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, released Skytrans mark in March.
Michael Thinee, executive director of Skytrans, said that the contract with QCG had already created jobs.
"We managed to regroup 18 Skytrans personnel with the whole standard as pilots and team members," he said.
We are also pleased to have a new staff, with direct logistical experience in managing flight operations for QGC customers.
In just five months, we grew 100% of the workforce, 78 staff members being employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract follows Skytrans to extend its flight operations from its central headquarters in Cairns, which serves Capul York and Torres Strämtorea, and includes a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 flights back every week for QGC staff and companies from Brisbane to the locations of Chinchilla and Taroom, in his Dash-8 planes of 36 locations, starting from October 26.
Tony Nunan, Executive Director of the QGC, said Skytrans received the contract following a tender procedure.
"We are pleased that this contract will contribute to the expansion of a company in Queensland," he said.
The Skytrans contract maintains high quality flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal parliamentarian Kelly O'Dwyer receives advice to make a bigger milk reserve to avoid voting in the House
Looks like there's more women in the cabinet.
Malcolm Turnbull's new government will be invested in months and there are strong signs that more women will take over the portfolio.
One of the government's views on the rise of the government, Kelly O'Dwyer, has taken the advice to make a greater reserve of milk for her newborn in order to avoid the neglect to intervene in her parliamentary duties.
The advice comes from the responsibility of the government's discipline, Scott Buchholz, who has further consulted the labyrinth to find out which is the most appropriate approach for a parliamentarian who agrees with the existing orders.
Liberal Parliamentary Kelly O'Dwyer and her daughter, Olivia.
In accordance with the existing orders - the set of rules governing the behaviour of parliamentarians in the House - mothers who are acquiesced receive a voting power in Parliament.
This means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the House.
But Whip didn't know about this exoneration before he consulted the responsibility of the opposition's discipline, Chris Hayes, on this issue.
The events took place on two occasions when O'Dwyer could not participate in a division meeting and could not fulfill his obligation to hold a speech because it was just beginning to join.
On one of these occasions, her team was asked if she was thinking of making a bigger milk reserve instead of getting along.
Scott Buchholz, Parliamentary of Queensland, is responsible for government discipline.
Later, the two of them solved the dispute.
Both refused to comment when they were contacted by Fairfax Media, but separate sources by Buchholz and O'Dwyer declared to Fairfax Media that the representative of the Higgins Division was angry when they were told to make a bigger baby reservation instead of joining their daughter, Olivia, born in May.
This fact is revealed when the new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is working on the creation of his new cabinet.
Buchholz, a independent national parliamentarian of Queensland, was promoted in the role of discipline by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as part of the negative effect of the censorship attempt in February of this year.
O'Dwyer, in image with Amanda Richworth of the Labour Party and her son, Percy, is one of the three mothers in Parliament.
The past responsible for discipline, Phillip Ruddock, was removed only a few days after Abbott faced a censorship motive by which he wanted his removal from the function, being replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nikolic, a Tasmanian liberal, was also promoted and appointed responsible for joint discipline.
Nickolic was recently arrested on the first page of the newspaper after he discovered that he had sent Turnbull a message asking him to give up his behavior.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after her daughter, Olivia, was born in May.
It's one of the three parliamentarians who became mothers this year.
The spokesman for the labist party, Catherine King, said Wednesday that the power of vote for mothers who are breast-feeding was introduced when her son was baby.
"Now he's [seven years]," she wrote on Twitter.
The person responsible for discipline should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted in the cabinet at the end of last year and may be promoted under Turnbull, who announced Wednesday that he wants more women in his office.
"No one wants more than me to see more women in power, influence, in Parliament, in the ministry, throughout the country," the Prime Minister in front of the reporters in Parliament said.
Abbott included one woman in his first cabinet and, after pressure sustained to increase female representation in Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet after remanding in December.
Five things you want the business environment from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will the markets react?
Mal Maiden, a business editor, examines the impact that Malcolm Turnbull might have on the Australian business sector.
Tuesday, Lobby groups in the business sector didn't know how to show their enthusiasm more strongly when Malcolm Turnbull took over the country's peace as prime minister.
The main reason is that a large part of what many of them would have wanted to see were abandoned under Tony Abbott's leadership.
Or just arrived in a negotiated suspension due to Abbott's "crash-or-crash-through" policy style.
Representatives of interest groups spoke to the Union about their hope in Turnbull's ability to satisfy public interest, reach a political agreement and do good works.
So what exactly awaits the country's largest companies and their representatives of our new prime minister?
CHAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to overcome negative publicity.
Turnbull itself has set a right to start free trade agreement with China.
In its first speech in which it announced that action in the medium term, the Free Trade Agreement between China and Australia (ChAFTA) represented the central point of its attack on lab leader Bill Shorten.
In a speech in August, Turnbull criticised "revelations of economic slavism" by the Labour Party on the issue and expressed concern over the racist attempt of critics.
"In the context of CHAFTA, winners are, numerically, much more than losses," he said in the same speech.
The media hopes he will win this debate.
Don Argus, a legendary representative of the business environment, stressed that this is an essential point, being supported, among others, by the Australian Business Council (which represents the largest 100 companies in the country) and by James Packer, the billionaire of the gambling industry.
The media wants to conclude this agreement, and this will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to overcome negative advertising and negotiate with the whole Senate.
The Minister for Small Enterprises, Bruce Billson, supports the recommendations of the Harper Analysis.
This could still lead to some differences with the business environment.
The impact assessment shall apply in the case of large mergers and other contracts to decide whether consumers will suffer from lack of competition.
It is called ‘Effect assessment’ because it takes into account not only the actions and intentions of the company but also the effect it will have on competition and the market.
The way in which this assessment is prepared is extremely important for the outcome.
An analysis of competition law recommends a change in the impact assessment, which will make it more difficult for large corporations to get smaller operators out of the market.
The government led by Tony Abbott was on the side of the Australian Business Council and the large retailer.
Turnbull now understands that he wants the whole cabinet to think about what he's going to do next.
CAA has been reluctant to claim that if Turnbull follows Harper's analysis recommendations, consumers will need to pay higher prices.
It is ironic that the whole business environment is the one that has advised the new Prime Minister to have greater respect for the cabinet processes, which Turnbull seems to do by leaving Bruce Billson, the Minister for Small Enterprise (which is part of Harper's recommendations), to support his arguments in front of his colleagues.
Meditarian diet could contribute to the prevention of cancer
Spanish researchers have followed women aged between sixteen and eight years of age.
Those who eat mainly plants, fish and measles have reduced the likelihood of cancer in the blood.
Terrence Howard puts the multiplicity table under the question mark
Terrence Howard is of the opinion that I fully understood arithmetic error.
The negative person from the Empire said for Rolling Stone magazine that he doesn't think once is equal to one.
"How to be equal to one?" he said.
If once I do one, it means that both have no value, because once he has no effect.
Once I do two, because the square root of his four is two, so what is the square root of his two?
It should be one, but we say it's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't really understand what you mean.
Little surprising, Howard's professors didn't agree with his theory, so it gave up at Pratt Institute, where the chemical engineering study.
"I mean, you can't close your eyes when you know something's wrong," he explained.
Howard found for his parallel approach on mathematics called "Terryology".
The actor testifies that he spends his time painting and regathering prefetches, snakes, magnets and plastic wax to illustrate his "one-time" theory and other similar theories of his.
He said for the magazine that he and his wife, Mira Pak, spent up to 17 hours a day creating these pictures.
Editor Rolling Stone described Howard's creations as "infinitely complex, bidimensional and tridimensional forms, related to copper snakes or magnets".
Howard says, among other things, he hopes to receive the US patent 20150079872 A1 (“Systems and methods for improved construction loads”).
The actor from "After an idol" also says that Pitagora Einstein and Tesla would "take a break" if they saw Terrorism.
"You know," he says, "I've been asking myself since I was three or four years old why does a bullet take shape around?"
Why doesn't it become a triangular or a pattern?
I understand why.
Howard added that he hopes to change the entire course of education.
"This will be the last century in which our children will learn that once they do one thing," he said.
They won't need to grow up in ignorance anymore.
In 20 years now, they'll know that once I do two.
We're about to discover a new truth.
The universal mathematical truth.
We'll check in some 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitates Britney Spears at Wheel of Impression
Tuesday, during the "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop singer sang a little at the Wheel of Impression of Fallon, playing "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as Spears, then showing the lyrics with "The Wheels on the Bus" song with Aguilera's voice.
In turn, Fallon did a good job imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
The two also played versions of "I Can't Feel My Face" from The Week.
This week, Grande's name's still in print.
On the same day she was also at Good Morning America, where she opened the show with the Gogoash Island incident.
Taco Bell hopes that "Cantina" restaurants where wine will be used to become points of interest to the city
Do you want to spend an elegant night in town?
Taco Bell is an option.
On 22 September, the fast-food restaurant chain in Mexican style will open a new location in the Wicker Park area of Chicago, offering an appetizer-type menu, a fresco painted by a local artist and even alcoholic beverages.
It is the first test location of the "Taco Bell Cantina" restaurants of the chain, which is directed to young people, concentrated increasingly in the city centre.
Taco Bell, which has nearly 6,000 restaurants in the U.S., has its radicals mainly in the suburbs and is associated with cheap food, prepared quickly, such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With a 7-US average Taco Bell payment note, the company used drive-through service and fast service to attract the number of customers needed to benefit.
But Taco Bell says that in order to address new generations "search for more central urban environments in which to live, work and enjoy", testing sites must follow a different model, with smaller spaces and more expensive options.
To make a drive-through, you need land.
Can you imagine what it means to buy an accompaniment in an area like Wicker Park?
"You won't be allowed," said U.S. TODAY Neil Borkan, French Taco Bell who will operate the Chicago location.
At the Chicago location, the new menu will be prepared along with traditional Taco Bell offers, in an open restaurant where "you can see your own food" before being prepared, said to Associated Press Meredith Sandland, head of development at Taco Bell.
Also, wine, beer and frozen alcoholic beverages will be served in the new location, following the recent example of many Taco Bell competitions.
Now, seventy-five Starbucks cafes offer "nightly" menus that include beer, wine and taste.
One thousand of the about 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic beverages.
The company stated that another location Taco Bell Cantina will open in San Francisco near AT&T Park this month, replacing the drive-through service and parking with an internal court and a window for sale.
These changes in location, atmosphere and annex indicate that the fast food restaurant chain wants to attract other types of customers outside those looking for fast food at night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time on a higher quality mining line in 2012, when he opened Cantina and Burritos more expensive, to compete with Chipotle, the project was supported through a campaign focused on the content of new products protein.
If they did, Cantina restaurants will represent another step towards a higher level.
Taco Bell said that by 2022, he intends to open 2,000 restaurants in the United States.
As Sandland said for the AP, "some hundred" of these will be "Cantina".
They make calls in the middle of the night: Elton John makes Putin's court
Russian President Vladimir Putin contacted Elton John's phone last night just a few days after the British artist publicly said he wanted to meet Russian politicians to discuss the old Russian legislation together.
The said British gay singer has failed to get an interview with Putin while in Russia in November 2014, one year after he challenged the protests from this country and supported two concerts in 2013, during a period in the history of this country, after the adoption of conflicting laws that prohibit "homosexual propaganda" among the minorities.
In 2014, at St. Petersburg, British artist criticised these laws and made the following statement: "Although I am gay, I have always felt welcome here in Russia."
If I hadn't been honest about what I am, I wouldn't have been able to compose these songs.
They don't mean gay propaganda.
They represent the way I express life.
If we start punishing people for something like that, then the world will lose humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist went out of his mind to meet Putin to discuss this controversial subject.
So far, there is no clear information about the phone discussion between the two personalities.
Cocos "cant everything" in the ANRP file
Businessman Dorin Cocos is trying to save himself from a degrading condemnation, "cantant" in front of the judges and detailing how he spent the millions of euros of previous members of the ANRP Commission.
Last night at the Inalta Court of Casatie and Justice in the file where he was sentenced by his son or Alin Cocos, former head of DIICONA Alina Bica and former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of Disappearances under the ANRP, Dorin Cocos was hit by the park of integrity.
He acknowledged all the charges and told the judges how he helped businessman Gheorghe Stelian in the case of ANRP's disappearances, instead of being judged sooner and taking into account his collaboration.
Thus, Cocos showed that he had known George Stelian since 2006 and that he had been friends with it since several real estate transactions.
He explained that Sergiu Diacomatu met him in 2010, and this told him that he was working at ANRP.
Later we found out that (Diacomatou, n.r.) is Vice-President, and because George Stelian had a file at ANRP, we asked him to help us.
I promised her money, 2.5 million euros, the money I told her I'd give her more.
I promised him political support, so he could take the lead.
"Diacomatou told me that he was helping me, but he needs support," said Dorin Cocos in the courtroom.
He further said that, through a knowledge, he had entered into the relationship with Crinuta Dumitrean, who was then the head of the Central Commission of Despagubiri, which promised him 800,000 euros.
For George Stelian's second file, we knew that this wanted to get over 300,000 euros.
Diacomatu already had political support, and I gave him five million euros.
Crinutei Dumitrean a million euros, I gave Dragos Bogdan 800,000 euros.
I'm just saying that all this money was given in transit, to make sure that the file will be solved.
"My father told them to solve the file, get rid of it," said Cocos.
Asked why he was able to do these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million euros for the positive solution of the second file of Gheorghe Stelian.
I got, for the second file, eight million euros to solve the problem, but I only got EUR 1.2 million.
In 2013, I met Alina Bica.
"I've never talked to this money or land," Cocos showed.
He has already shown that "it was known that all ANRP members understood before the sitting."
I didn't have feelings that they wouldn't vote positive.
All the functions were political in ANRP, but I personally didn't help Diacomat.
"I told him I was only helping politics to calm him down," and Cocos concluded the statement.
Ponta brings the European Court of Justice to DNA
Prime Minister Victor Ponta was on DNA yesterday, for just five minutes, when he posted new documents in the "Turcen - Rovinari" file.
Victor Ponta fled to DNA with a document from the European Court of Justice
Convinced that the case prosecutor will receive for a discussion of the file's margin in which it is investigated for fraud in private signatures, complicated by tax and money saving, Victor Ponta went from his own initiative to DNA, although documents that could have been sent to them by a lawyer.
It wasn't like that, the prosecutor didn't have time, the Prime Minister leaving after five minutes, when he left for registration more documents.
I wanted to present the European Court of Justice decision on 3 September, which explains what is going on with service contracts.
I say that we have done business, the prosecutor says we haven't done it, the European Court of Justice has told us to see about the work of both, because, as long as taxes have been paid, it's okay.
"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is binding, certainly, for all the European Union's institutions, we have no case here," said Prime Minister Victor Ponta, on the issue of DNA.
Ponta further stated that, from a point of view, the decision of the European Court should apply if we are members of the EU.
Until then, the prime minister is waiting for the prosecutor to read the decision of the European Court of Justice and call him back to the hearings, but to give him an answer to his requests, through which he outlined the file.
John is defending the rule without television
In Romania today, there is no legal provision to force you to watch TV.
And you don't even have a device like that, since you pay your TV rate once with the energy bill.
Yes, if you're head of state, things change radically.
Because, in practice, it is understood that the seat of the President of Romania is also included in the memory of everyday realities.
President Johannis falls daily in a full line at the office or from Cotroceni
It's just that, to the surprise of the very closest people you know from the Cotroceni Palace, Klaus Johannis refuses to have television in the presidential office.
And after they don't look on television - on no program, not even at RTL or Pro Sieben's office, the presidents don't listen to any radio posts and they don't read any newspapers.
In addition, it does not even receive "negative monitoring" which, for example, the predecessor or a priority request.
Rather, Johannis is pleased to receive only the report on the stars that put him in a positive light.
And in the long run of this information self-insulating, where the only breath is access to the facebook, it is much more serious the blockade which, through its passport, the head of the state of impasse the entire activity of the Presidential Administration.
And that's because, although my dear father has been running since his installation, Johannis has not yet signed the statements of loyalty of more than half of the Presidential Administration's employees.
What becomes a more serious problem, both from a human point of view and from a legal point of view.
Lines and peace
Those in the presidential office are already clear that no one and nothing can strip "feng shui" out of the state branch.
Where it's quiet and peaceful.
What's right, just after the new hour without a minute (no more, no less!), morning, when the former Sibi was asked to present the officials.
A habit that probably didn't disappear from time to time when he was leading the capital of Cibin.
And the fact that Johannis doesn't want television in the office has already been born countless legends, being already people from the Cotroceni Palace who have come to point to the variant that the presidents would try to avoid his monitoring.
Especially if he doesn't have any radio devices.
Just like, at this rate, she's going to meditate as soon as she's in the dark, so that lighting devices can hide audio-video recording techniques.
All right.
Another surprise from the Cotroceni House is the delivery to the head of the state of "the objective monitoring" of the president's activities.
I mean, if there's any good news about Klaus Johannis or his wife, the head of state will receive his continued bureau.
If not, no!
And more interestingly, it has been banned from "negative monitoring" under conditions where, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only as the follow-up to night television broadcasts where he was criticised, but the demand every morning, with priority, negative stars.
That doesn't mean the mice like he helped him with something, but, that's what, the gesture contains!
And at least he can never apologize that he was not well informed of alternative sources.
Not elsewhere specified or included
Now, until then you'll see her and the mystery why she doesn't want to see Klaus Johannis on TV.
Until then, it would be more important to resolve, regardless of the formula, the contractual situation of employee support from the Presidency.
In order to be able to work here, they are obliged to sign a declaration of loyalty to the head of the State in force and which must bear and sign it.
It is only that since December and so far, Klaus Johannis has not signed to confirm even half of these statements, although this has to take place within a maximum of 30 days.
So hundreds of employees, representing over half of the staff in the Cotroceni Palace, have a uncertain situation now.
Because, legally speaking, if the head of state does not sign the declaration personally, they should be given outside.
It's just that all of them didn't get any negative opinion!
So, I mean, I can come by any inspectors of the Court of Auditors, who will find that over half a year ago, so many hundreds of people and they got their wages at least somewhere outside the law.
So far, the President shall also decide whether he will give it out or confirm it on the posts, the decision being strictly his.
The authorities declared that a teenager had launched an attack on Pope Francis during his visit to the United States
The inspired plan of an ISIS youth to attack Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S. was more "aspirational order" than operational, confirmed a source of the Fox News police in March.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in the Philadelphia area in August when the law enforcement authorities announced the plan.
The plan is the same as that referred to by the representative of Texas, Mike McCaul, the President of Internal Security, during an agreed Sunday interview, stated a source for Fox News.
"We closely monitor the threats against the Pope for his visit to the United States," McCaul at "This Week" from the ABC said.
Pope Francis has not been mentioned to mention the specific content of the plan in a booklet.
on common information from the FBI and the Department of Internal Security of 14 August, which states that the youth was planning to use more attackers, firearms and explosives, bearing in mind “a foreign deminant during a high-level event”.
The newsletter states that the minority has radicalized through social networks.
It is possible for the adolescent to suffer from a mental illness, stated a source of the law enforcement authority for Fox News, but without giving specific details about the youth’s illness.
Also on Sunday, McCaul acknowledged the potential for an attack by such a so-called "single hole" at the level of the entire nation and said that he was informed by the Secret Services about a "secretly secret location" for the Pope's visit.
And with this comes a great risk of security... We, as the time approaches, I think we'll be with all very careful and protect him when he gets to the United States.

The scale from the environmental period discovered in coca suffered a violent death, says experts
Irish archaeologists have revealed details of the strange skeleton dating from the medieval period, found in the ruins of a 215-year-old doll.
The Collowey's flag, Sligo, fell during a storm this year, putting on the light the massive view of a skeleton between its roots.
The Irish National Monuments Service has brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to explore and analyse the remains, discovering such a fascinating story.
"He was killed violent," said Marion Dowd, director of the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services for FoxNews.com.
At the top of the chest has wounds caused by a cut. There's one such back in the left hand, which suggests he's trying to open up.
The scene is of a young man between 17 and 20 years of age.
A radiocarbon analysis shows that the residues are between 900 and 1000 years old.
"We cannot know whether he was killed in a war or in a personal dispute," says Dowd, noting that the body was buried after a growing ritual, with the head headed west.
"Probably it was grouped by family or community," she added.
Dowd said for FoxNews.com that whoever planted the doll didn't know about the dead.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual one," she said.
There are historical documents proving that there is a church and a cemetery in the area, but there are no visible traces of them today.
There is another unusual aspect of discovery: the height of the youth.
“It has 1 meter 77”, says Dowd.
For the temporary environmental society, that means a lot.
The federal government spends $1.5 million to study what babies think about food
National Institutes for Health (NIH) have spent nearly $1.5 million studying what little children think about food.
The project, called "The Mode in which infants and young children understand little food", has been commissioned by the University of Chicago and has so far established that small ones are not intended to eat cheap food from other people or who have thrown away others.
According to the project financer, "adequate food is important for health and longevity, but many Americans do not have healthy diets from a nutritional point of view".
There is evidence suggesting that the first food models of infants and young children have long-term consequences for health throughout life.
The premium for this study is that they lack research on how to feed babies.
"In spite of the complexity and significance of the food selection, psychiatologists for the development of the child have devoted little or no attention to studying the way babies and children understand, learn and understand food, the financier said.
The current proposal applies methods of cognitive development to test social impacts on the choice and consumption of food for babies and young children.
Researchers say about babies having "limited knowledge in the food sector".
Children aged between three and six years "I know more about food than babies and small children", but they are "extreme motorists".
An actress who played "Star Trek: Voyager" is accused of inappropriate exposure to Tennessee
An actress who played in the "Star Trek: Voyager" television series was arrested in eastern Tennessee, accused of being exposed to children.
More media channels report that the actress Jennifer Ann Lien, 41 years old, who played Kes' role in the television series, is accused of two inappropriate exposure offences involving children under the age of 13, according to the arrest report.
The officers of the sheriff's office in Roane County brought the arrest warrant on September 3, at Lien's home in Harriman, where they say they found a hole under a canal.
The officers said Lien refused their requests for clothes.
Harriman's chief of police, Randy Heidle, says that Lien's head has brought him more charges, including his body injury in a severe form, after the April incident where he says Lien entered a police car with his own car.
He doesn't know if he's a lawyer yet.
The police identified the victim killed found in the Epping forest
A man whose body was decomposed was discovered in a tourist forest was identified.
On September 9, Hidir Aksakal, 53 years old, was found near Hollow Ponds in the Epping forest in northern London.
The man of Turkish origin lived in Margate, Kent, and had close ties with the Green Lanes area of Haringey, north of London.
The last time he was seen in Green Lanes in the morning of August 17th.
A post-mortem analysis has shown that he was killed, and detectives say his body is likely to be in the Epping forest for more than a week.
Inspector General Jamie Piscopo, from the metropolitan police, said: "Mr. Aksakal was well-known on the local level as the Cetin Boxer and we hope to find out from the Green Lanes community information that will help us research.
Hollow Ponds is a crowded and popular tourist place, where you can find a café and a lake for sailing by boat.
It is also surrounded by streets with intense traffic.
We ask all those who have been in the area for the past few weeks and may have observed some unusual activity or who will give us lunch, to come and talk to us.
Super boss: six women joggle between motherhood and service
Unlike any other country in the world, with the exception of Papua New Guinea, there is no centralised policy on maternity leave paid in the United States.
Two weeks ago, when Yahoo's executive director Marissa Mayer announced that he was pregnant with genes, but he intended to take a very short maternity leave and "work during" his free time, the 40-year-old woman was criticised on a broad scale for encouraging a culture that awaits superfeme or nothing.
But besides Mayer, she's a symbol of the top woman, to be guilty of unrealistic expectations?
How do other women's leaders manage?
Seema Patel, a lawyer and deputy director of the San Francisco Office for the Application of Labour Standards, just got a job in government in Washington DC a few years ago when her boss forgot her with an unexpected advice.
"I don't know anything about you," her boss told her.
But if you're going to make a family for you in the future, you're gonna get your license back.
Patel's agent was the federal government, and she didn't even receive a maternity leave paid as part of her employment contract.
At the time, Patel was single and very focused on career, and the family was the last thing he thought about.
But she listened to her boss's advice.
He refused to use his medical leave days for four years, so that, when he was pregnant with her first child two years ago, he spent three months of leave paid.
Six months ago, when the second child was born, Patel could no longer apply the same strategy.
The four months of leave he took them were totally unpaid.
Patel says he didn't feel any rejection from her colleagues, but he has a problem with the structure of the job.
"I feel very disappointed for anyone who tries to have a family," she says.
Send a message: Your country doesn't value you being a parent.
Karen Choi, Vice-President of the Capital Group asset management company, says that any employed woman who is and her mother must be praised.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six-month-old baby, describes the jungle between the quality of mother and the right "a constant battle".
The secret to don't bother you is to have "an incredible family with you" and a good and a babysitter, to accept that there are things you won't be the best" (“not everyone can be Martha on the inside”) and just go through it.
Choi says she has taken an even greater maternity leave for each child, starting from two and a half months for the first and ending with six months for the last.
This makes her an exception, especially in her field of activity.
When your child is sick, he has fever, vomiting, and you stay all night to care for him, and you know that next morning you have to take the other kids to school, then go to the service...
Then it becomes very complicated," she says.
However, her company supported her and said that the performance of her investment portfolio had not suffered at all.
When she entered the finance industry after her university, about 20 of her college colleagues chose the same way, she says.
Today, about 90% of them have given up.
Women who give up work, then start again have no other chance at well-paid top posts, she says.
It is difficult to remain: “In short it is a sacrifice, but in long term the results are seen.”
Anyway, her children helped her to make this sacrifice, because all four of her children are girls.
One of the things that helps me go further is that I want to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example for her four children is what motivates her scientist and professor Kelly Posner, at the age of 48.
The children know their mother helps, in fact, save human life.
Posner, founder and director of the Centre for the Risk Assessment of Suicide at Columbia University, says it is important for women to know that they can have a "measurable objective" in terms of their career and to fulfill it.
It's very important for women to believe I can have a vision.
Most people don't believe this," she says.
He once held a presentation in front of 200 people, including government officials, in Italy during a web browser when he was pregnant in eight months.
It also helped technology, she says, because she can stop the car and answer the phone after she takes her children or respond to an e-mail from the market.
The challenge between motherhood and a demanding career has been helped by an optimistic personality, focused on solving problems, she says. The ability to bring things to a good end even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, 33 years old, the executive director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and mother of two children, says that doing maternity and career work together only through private assistance networks, such as well, is wrong.
"You shouldn't be lucky or win the lottery for success," she says, describing the failure of the system to support women and families - mentioning very small wages, the weak health system and the lack of a maternity leave paid.
"As societies, we don't care about each other," she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of mothers who were just born.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while following the courses of law school, gave birth to the child at the first bus.
With a husband and a child who was based on the medical assistance offered by the bus, the employer could take a maternity leave for just two weeks and then return to the service.
Lisa Mosko, a mother of two, says that fewer women will leave their profession if they will benefit from more social support, in the form of day care services from companies, maintaining common-agreement programmes and accepting the fact that the work does not mean being on the program.
In the face of logistical constraints, Moscow says, there is additional pressure to act in a area where being a mother is sometimes the same as having a lack of taste (the "mother's clothes" is one of the most serious insults).
"The image is part of our work - it lifts you up or throws you down," she explains.
Moscow's "permanent negotiation" because its multiple roles work harmonizing means keeping its aspect and a beautiful ring in hand, which, however, sometimes has to fall into a two-part game.
If he remembers that men are also fathers, the society could allow women to do more.
People don't judge men as good fathers as they judge women who are mothers.
The Olatoye School, the President and the Executive Director of the New York housing authority, who handles over 400,000 newies and has over 11,000 employees, says that maternity and career does not mean talking about "equivalent".
The idea of balance is a little inappropriate.
It looks like a balance sheet," she says.
The mother of three children, one of whom is only three months old, just took a maternity leave for seven weeks after she was born this year.
"It was a very important period for the agency," she explained.
He knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband managed to give her a maternity leave, and she managed to have a flexible program, which meant to leave early or late, so that she could join her child.
Olatoye, who argues with her friends every morning that ends at 06:00 (“more effective than therapy”) is still on hold.
At the service, she tried to create a "friendly for parents" environment in which the late delivery of a child is permitted and the response to the e-mail must not be sent out by the office.
"The concept and the family concept have changed and changed a lot," says Olatoye.
"The family is very different from what happened 25 or even 10 years ago."
The job is the one that needs to be adapted.
Russian killers say they lied to Elton John about a phone from Putin.
For Chinese it seems too beautiful to be true: a phone from Vladimir Putin, Russian President to Sir Elton John, a singer and military for the rights of sexual minorities, in which to discuss the rights of homosexuals.
Unfortunately for John, it was not true: despite an exuberant post on Instagram in which the Russian leader thanked him for addressing the problem, it immediately became clear that anyone had called him last night, he certainly wasn't Putin.
The Kremlin has already declared he has no knowledge of that conversation.
And on Wednesday, two famous Russians acknowledged that they, not the president, were foreign voices from the other end of the conversation.
"We thought it was less likely that Putin would like to meet him or call him or at least not too soon," says Vladimir "Vovan" Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague Alexei "Lexus" Stoliarov was entitled to the word of President Dmitri Peskov.
"We seem to be Elton John just waiting for this phone, so he immediately thought it was actually a conversation with the right people we gave us," he said to the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.
He said: "Thank you, it was the surprise of the day."
That day and this conversation were the most wonderful and most enjoyable of my life.
To expose John's standing position, the two announced that they would publish a record of the conversation at a popular Russian night show.
John's representatives have not made statements on the speculations.
On the basis of the story, the comments made on the weekend were made by Putin, who criticised Putin for his "ridiculous" attitude towards homosexuals while the LGBT rights military in Kiev, particularly by criticising a Russian law adopted in 2013, which prohibits the spread of "provance for non-traditional sexual relations" among young people.
"I would like to meet him [in Putin], let's talk," John told the BBC, saying that, although the idea was "probably unrealistic", it was worth a try.
Then, on Monday evening, the song shattered the mistrust of observers when he published a message on a social network, claiming Putin responded to his critics by taking his phone and calling him.
He said he was "waiting patiently to meet [the President] in front of him to discuss the equality of LGBT in Russia".
Unfortunately for John, Putin was not the one from the other end of the line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, known for telephones in the play of many Russian and Ukrainian celebrities and politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks well of English, played Peskov's role and claimed he would be the interpreter of the two.
When asked about the possibility of a conversation, the truth Peskov told reporters March that Putin would "be ready to meet Elton John and answer all his questions", but that at Kremlin no such request was received from the song.
The Kremlin had reason to question the authenticity of Instagram's position, he added, "particularly because it is not written in a proper English."
We don't think Sir Elton John would have written such grammar mistakes.
Even before the Russians declared their public fairies, local media warned that John was the victim of a joke.
Some users in the online environment have identified Krasnov's right to blame, known for the phrasings made by politicians with phones that record them and post them on their YouTube channel like Vovan222.
The phone calls in play to the public, then the publication of the records became a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, who is considered by many to be the founder of the gene, developed the talent to make Ukrainian politicians faint.
He was interviewed on the Ukrainian television by imitating Anton Gerašchenko, the direct adviser to the Minister of Interior, Arsen Avakov.
He imitated Gerašchenko so well that last year he spoke to the former governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Ihor Kolomoiski, better than six hours in more days.
Krasnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary elections, which led to massive street protests following massive fraud reports.
In his case Arkadi Dvorkovich, then president Dmitri Medvedev, convinced the president of the electoral committee, Vladimir Churov, that Medvedev intended to grant him.
In addition to numerous Russian celebrities, among its victims were former URSS President Mihail Gorbaciov, head of Kiev and champion at the Vitali Klitschko box and Russian sport minister Vitali Mutko, who apologized for the behavior of his athletes.
Last year, Krasnov would have called on President Aleksandr Lukašenko, referring to the son of the Ukrainian leader Demis, Viktor Ianukovici.
It was so convincing that the person from the other end, whose voice was similar to Lukašenko's, offered him asylum.
John's initial statement that he would like to discuss with Putin caused a serious reaction in Russia.
Vitali Milonov of St. Petersburg, who contributed to the law on "propagandist", told The Guardian that John should not bother Putin with a "so important subject" and that he was ready to meet with the singing to explain Russia's position.
The Moscowsky Komsomolets newspaper opened an online poll for readers, in which 39% of respondents thought Putin and John should meet, and 22% considered that meeting would also damage Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die from air pollution than malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, more than 3 million people per year die early due to external air pollution, more than malaria and HIV/AIDS together.
The main cause, especially in Asia, is wood and coal for heating and cooking, but research reveals that a similar alarm is agricultural emissions from Europe and the United States, where they represent the main cause of these deaths.
The report warns that unless measures are taken, the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths per minute - will double by 2050.
"These projects should draw a warning signal for public health agencies around the world," said Professor Michael Jerrett, an environmental health expert at the University of California, who was not involved in research.
Most of the deaths caused by air pollution are caused by small particles, which can be deeply inhaled into the lungs.
These cause heart attack and stroke, which are responsible for three patrols of the 3.3 million deaths per year, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory diseases.
The research did not include the effects of internal air pollution, such as the fumes for food, which is estimated to cause another 3.4 million deaths per year.
The new study, published in the Nature newspaper, is the first to highlight various sources of air pollution outside and estimate the number of premature deaths caused by them, taking into account road traffic, fossil fuels and other sources.
Researchers have used a detailed computerized model of the global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on different populations, including new information on how pollution affects China and India.
One third of all premature deaths were the result of the use of smoke-producing fuels, such as wood and coal, for heating the homes or food, and of the use of light fuel generators for electricity, all of which are recognized risks.
This type of internal energy consumption results in half of India's 645,000 annual deaths and a third of China's 1.4 million annual deaths.
However, research has found that the agricultural emissions of ammonia have had a "remarkable" impact, according to Professor Jos Lelieveld of the German Chemical Max Planck Institute, which led the research.
Five of the deaths at global level are caused by these emissions, which are mainly from life, birds and porcine and overuse of fat.
The ammonia reacts to traffic and industrial emissions and produces small particles, as the main cause of deaths due to the pollution of air from the U.S., Japan and Europe.
"To London, agriculture is the main source," Lelieveld says.
Throughout the United Kingdom, 48% of premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Traffic pollution is still an important factor in developed countries, leading to five deaths, despite measures against pollution vehicles.
This has only caused 5% of deaths worldwide, but the number could increase as more cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
Central air pollution, especially those operating with coal, has been significant at global level, causing one of the seven deaths.
In the U.S. it represents the main factor, causing a third of the 55,000 deaths per year, compared with 16% in the United Kingdom.
The natural air pollution, especially in the arid regions and in very dry regions, has caused nearly one fifth of the deaths worldwide due to air pollution.
This source represents a major factor in some arid countries, responsible for 92% of the deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
"The separation between the high degree of pollution and the high number of residents tells them about public health, but nothing more is known about the sources of pollution responsible for premature deaths," says Jerrett.
The results are surprising and potentially important for the protection of public health at global level.
It is now assumed that all particles are of the same toxicity.
But if fuel burning causes are more toxic, as some scientists believe, the percentage of premature deaths that can be attributed to agricultural emissions would be smaller.
Even so, Jerrett says "discovery is very valuable... because agriculture has not been seen in general as a major source of air pollution or premature death and because it suggests that more attention should be paid to agricultural sources, both by scientists and by political authorities."
Dr. Oliver Wild, an environmental specialist from Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, said: "The study actually highlights the need for air quality control to avoid these deaths, especially in very popular areas of Asia".
A statement by Victor Ponta Tension and More Relations With Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to infect with lies, the Romanian Prime Minister speaks of attitudes that bring back memories of Nazism
Relations with Hungary, already tense after the announcement of the construction of a border guard with Romania, after the Serbian border, have experienced a new depression following the statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who accused the authorities of Budapest of dealing with refugees "with beatings and insertions".
The Hungarian diplomat has reacted strongly by speaking of "extramest and false" claims, but no Victor Ponta has been left out of favor and has accused government officials from neighboring countries as "a mess" for Europe.
Noting that it is not for the first time when Ponta tries to tense Roman-ungage relations by statements made at delicate or selective times.
It all started with a statement made by Victor Ponta, in which he tries to argue that Romania cannot receive more than 1,800 refugees.
Your problem with our logistics ability to treat these people like some people, not how it treats our magical neighbors, with a fight and injection.
I don't agree with that.
Mr. Basescu put in front of an angry and horrible feeling that exists in all societies, i.e. a xenofob feeling.
It's very good to have a debate, but we're in charge of solving problems.
"We'll treat these people as we do," said Victor Ponta, quoted by the Truth.
It is not clear what Victor Ponta was referring to when he spoke about the integration of refugees, but Cehia was recently in the centre of criticism after writing the numbers of migrants found in several trains, in a gesture that recalled the Nazi procedure used to identify the Jewish prisoners from concentration camps.
Peter Szijjarto appreciated, according to the MTI news agency, taken by Magyardok.hu, that probably internal political crises that have challenged Victor Ponta's position make it "extremely and false".
The Roman business insurgent from Budapest was summoned to provide explanations, reports Mediafax, citing MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta has recently made inappropriate statements on how Hungary manages the crisis of immigrants," the Hungarian Foreign Minister explains.
Levente Magyar, State Secretary for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in the Hungarian MAE, expressed "surprising" in connection with Victor Ponta's ongoing attempts to save his moral position by anti-anguing lies," underlined Budapest's diplomat.
"I do not want to respond to the challenges brought by Hungarian government representatives - but read the report below and you will understand the anger that I feel as a European man and citizen, the girl of mind and attitudes that Europe has only seen in the 1930s!!" wrote Ponta, on his Facebook account.
He argues that, like other European politicians, it has "the duty" to draw attention and punish "the constant behaviour of government officials at the highest level in Hungary" who are "a mess for the culture and values of the European Union" by "anti-semit attitudes", "the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the crisis of refugees!"
"Sharma ghumpa, aggressive laws, closures and brutality will certainly not solve problems - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decisions with nothing better than those from Syria, Libya or other countries from which these refugees flee!", accused Ponta, he claims that he believes in "solidity, rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the majority of European values", and "What we see in Hungary in recent days is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!"
In the course of the series, Ponta was invited to Antena 3, where the main subject was Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea named Victor Orban the one who hated Europe, a dictator, Ponta wondered what would happen if the Hungarian military were shooting and shooting or killing some children or some women, in a speech in which he made more references to Nazism.
In the debate, UDMR President Kelemen Hunor, who considers that the Roman authorities should not have a "sensitive approach" in connection with Hungary's intention to build a fence.
The UDMR leader says it should be understood that this solution is not directed against the Romans or the Roman citizens, he shows that the guard could even help our country not become an intense route passed by migrants who will reach the Schengen area, according to Agerpress.
Firstly, I want to highlight, I say, that we must not insist on taking all this as something against Romania and should not be used to undermine any relationship between the two governments, because it's not the case.
I think any emotional approach is wrong.
"We need to see the rationale, see why we have come here and we need to know and say this, that it is not against us, it is not against Romania, the Roma citizens, and it does not prevent the free movement between the two states, within the EU," Kelemen Hunor said.
The news ignored Russia's offer to launch Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership in 2012
Russia has now proposed for more than three years the launch of the President of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, on the right of a peace agreement, in accordance with another official involved at the time in negotiations with the villages occupied between the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation, writes The Guardian.
The former President of Finland and Lord of the Nobel Peace Prize, Martti Ahtisaari, said that the Western powers have not benefited from the proposal since then.
Since 2012, tens of thousands of people have died and millions more have been forced to flee, despite the most severe crisis of refugees since the end of World War II.
Ahtisaari held discussions with representatives of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (USA, United Kingdom, France, Russian Federation, and China) in February 2012.
This further stated that during the discussions, the Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churchin offered a plan which included among others and Assad's proposal to give up power at a given time after the start of peace negotiations between the regime and the opposition.
It proposes three things:
One - we don't have to put up with the opposition.
Two - we need to start a dialogue between Assad and opposition immediately.
"Three - we have to look for an elegant way for Assad to retreat," Ahtisaari said, relating to the position of the Russian ambassador.
In fact, he said that Ahtisaari, the United States, the Great Britain and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator followed each other, while ignoring the Russian ambassador's proposal.
"It was a lost opportunity in 2012," the former Finnish president continued.
Officially, Russia has strongly supported Bashar al-Assad over the past four and a half years of war, insisting that its inlet cannot represent a proposal in no peace agreement.
Assad thinks Russia will never leave him.
Moscow recently started sending troops, tanks and military aircraft to Syria, in an effort to stabilize Assad's regime and to face the extremes of the Islamic State.
The free Internet program for Antenai 3 will be available at cost
Antena 3 informed the viewers that since 1 November the program or live could be viewed online against cost, on the basis of a monthly subscription.
In a "written by viewers", the post of the Intact Trust says that "we do this with a foreign heart, and we want to get tools and in this new stage, driven by the conditions of the road".
According to the same message, the subscription will be 1 euro per month "for those of you who follow us online", the television promising that vision will be very good.
Antena 3 claims that "all these broadcasts directly from the country and abroad, campaigns, day-to-day events have been and are possible through a constant financial effort, taken into account, which has meant permanent retechnologicalization and quality focusing".
We have managed to support ourselves alone, under conditions where offline and online distributors have not contributed anything for the continuous offer.
The announcement comes under the conditions in which the video television program is accessible on the basis of subscription and online Antena Play platform, where, on the other hand, the most easily accessible and registration of the Antene emissions has been made.
Reports show that the populations of animals and marine plants have doubled over the past 40 years.
The scale of the crisis facing animals and marine plants is detailed in a study that states that marine species worldwide, including essential for human food security, are in a decline that can be disastrous.
Presses without prior directions to the global ocean ecosystem are combined and creates a world of difficulties for almost all marine life, says the WWF's "White Planet" report.
Coral Recipes are subject to serious risks of declin (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and large trees, which depend on many other species, have recorded a significant decline, while the entire population of fish with commercial value, such as macro and tonal, has fallen verginos with three spheres in front of the 1970s, shows the report.
Many coral reefs, usually described as tropical forests of the oceans due to their green biodiversity, could be threatened with extinction by the end of this century if the ocean's acidity continues to deteriorate, as a result of the rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, resulting in a direct increase in the level of carbon dioxide in the sea.
"The healthy seas represent an extraordinary source of beauty and natural wonder and are also a basis for the functioning of the global economy," said Louise Heaps, chief marine policy adviser to WWF-UK, who contributed to the completion of the report.
"By too much fishing, which damages coastal habitats, and without solving global warming problem, we produce the seeds of an environmental economic disaster," says Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of scientific literature published, but also on the Life Planet Index, a database maintained by London's Zoological Society, is one of the most detailed studies on marine life ever undertaken.
Nearly 20% of the total mangrove zones disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) This has investigated a wide variety of marine species, from fish, sea turtles and large mammals - a similar animal of a worm, with a sharp skin - to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that the algae areas decreased by approximately 30% in the last century, while the total mangrove areas decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of the fishing of fats and other forms of aquaculture.
Over a single generation, human activity has caused serious damage to the ocean, catching fish faster than it can be reproducated and also destroying its banks.
There is a need for profound changes in order to ensure abundant ocean life in the next generations," said Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines have been recorded in fishing species for commercial profits.
For example, 58 populations of 17 species belonging to the Scrombidae family - macrou, tonnes and sardines - fell by 74% between 1970 and 2010, without signs of recovery, says the report.
We are in a course of fishing that could end with people being deprived of a vital food source and an essential economic engine.
Overfishing, destruction of marine habitats and climate change have serious consequences for the entire human population, and the poor communities, which are based on the sea, will be hit the fastest and most powerful," Lambertini said.
"The collapse of the ocean ecosystems could declare a serious economic decline and could undermine our fight for the eradication of poverty and undernutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, Scientific Director of the ZL, said: "These alarming figures prove how rapidly people change oceans' plants and animals and represent a clear warning of the problems we could face as a result."
The big tree: deep undersea "flies" that capture the sediments rich in minerals and stabilize the bottom of the sea.
Over the last century, coverage has decreased by 30%.
Mangrove: Their existence is known in 123 countries, nearly half of the total, representing only five countries.
Nearly 20% of the total mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly due to human invasion.
Coral reefs: some of the richest and most productive habitats from a biological point of view.
A range of all marine species live in coral reefs or near them, but three of them are currently threatened and many can disappear during this century if the ocean's acidity continues to deteriorate.
Deeper habitats: they are very little known about the longer areas of the ocean, but the decline in the number of fish caught in these inaccessible locations in the last 40 years suggests that they are also affected by marine change at global level.
Steven Gerard denies the racist charges that his former co-pilot from Liverpool, El-Hadji Diouf, would have brought him.
In a passage from his autobiography "My Story" (My Story), serialized by Daily Mail, Gerard criticises the Senegalese player saying "he's not really interested in football" and that he's the colleague who liked "the least" in the 17 years you spent at the club.
In response, Diouf would have responded to Gerard's signalling radio post Group Futures Media, with other translations attributed to the attacker, who would have said that "Gerard never liked color people".
Gerard's lawyers denied any racist charges brought to him.
In his most recent book, Gerard, who has made it public and before his poor opinion of Diouf, criticised the attitude and degree of professionalism of his former colleague.
"I don't want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his seasons spent at Liverpool as an example of how I can walk things on the dock," he writes.
"I don't think Diouf is really interested in football and that he doesn't care about Liverpool," he continued.
For example, the way he threw a big and old flame into a Celtic fan in a game of Cupa Uefa from Parkhead in March 2003 is proof of his disgusting and rare behavior.
Diouf proved to be a controversial figure all the time during Anfield, his most famous night being the Celtic Park.
The former Senegalese was questioned by the police after the skirmish episode and amended by the counter-value of his salary at the club for two weeks, the amount of 60,000 lire being granted to a humanitarian organization at Celtic's election.
In his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerard describes Diof as being lazy and selfish.
"His attitude was completely wrong," Gerrard wrote.
I felt that it wasn't just about to make all the effort to help Liverpool get back to the top.
Diouf, who is now playing at the Malaysian Sabah club, criticised him, publicly, to Gerard and attacked Gerard's old friend and co-pilot Jamie Carrageher.
In 2012, Diouf called Gerard "egoist" and claimed that no one from Anfield liked the player who led the team to the victory of the League of Championships in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted as saying Gerrard is "gelos".
He said: “Gerard is just jealous of me.
He didn't get the results I had in the football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the boss's status, and he lives there.
I'm respected in the world of football, the biggest football experts drew me between the first seven players at the World Championship and the first 100 players of the century.
Many big players don't have a sense of belonging.
Wherever I'm going in other countries, I'm here, while Gerard is Jewish several times leaving his hometown of Liverpool.
From the career of the professional dancer: Alek Skarlatos' quick way to "Dancing With the Stars"
In this season of "Dancing With the Stars", Alek Skarlatos does not only play the role of hero in uniform.
It is also a young, attractive and athletic type, equally discreet and modern, say producers.
"There are many categories and we are always looking for the most popular moment," Deena Katz, a co-producer of the ABC show, said.
I swear they'll find their printer after that.
It's fascinating.
He's got something special.
Before being competitive at the famous show - but just a few weeks ago - Scarlatos arrived at the international press after taking his stand for a serious danger.
He and his two childhood friends, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, mobilized a man armed with an AK-47 in a train full of passengers from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three stopped what could have been a mass murder by a potential terrorist.
After that, Scarlatos, a 22-year-old saint in the National Army, who grew up near Sacramento, received a phone from President Obama, a message on Twitter from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and the French government.
Although some local appreciation may have been anticipated - Friday in Sacramento, there was a parade in the interest of the youth - it was not expected to take part in such positive reactions or in the invitation to participate in "Dancing With the Stars".
"No one in a million years would have thought I'd get this offer," Skarlatos testified Saturday, in a break from the dance rehearsals together with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.
I think it's all new and crazy.
Even if he admitted before the show last night that he was "hard-emotioned", he turned out as a professional at his first Foxtrot, getting points that brought him close to the front of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hugh, who formed the jury, said he offered one of the best representatives of the series.
Katz and the executive producer from "DWTS" Rob Wade said they wanted to keep a free place in the show for guests invited to the last hundred metres, as is the case of Skarlatos, who grew up in the public's eyes.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends who were on vacation, who had a gun attack in a train with 500 passengers and immediately thought to invite one of them to the dance competition.
He looked for social networks, found family members, and sent messages to Scarlatos.
When it appeared at "Good Morning America" to tell the incident during which Stone and other passengers were injured, Katz worked with the ABC's sister program to avoid passing through all media barriers.
And she supported "five-minute pendulum", then she waited patiently to find out if Scarlatos would agree to participate in "DWTS".
"There was a time when everything was very uncertain, because that's so different from what he does," said Katz.
Not long after the war in Afghanistan, and now we're asking him if he has a dance boss.
Scarlatos, who's in a short concession from the National Guard, didn't even see a whole show until recently.
He wants to participate, especially because he doesn't want to be just him taken out of evidence.
The show couldn't invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ass in hand: Noah Galloway, war veteran, hand and foot amputated.
This encouraged Scarlatos to call Galloway, the favorite fan and finalist of the past season, and to ask him about his experience.
This was probably the critical point, in addition to the unintended "intention" of Katz and "insistence messages", she said.
"Noah is a great guy and I wanted to know how the army would be built and how my friends' image would be protected," Skarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
So, after that conversation, I agreed.
Skarlatos, a great sports and history lover, never danced until then, and Arnold witnessed in interviews that he was trying to make him relax and give up on the military position quite rigid.
But Katz says it's amazing that it's going to fit and that the spectators will react positively.
He'll get a lot of love from the beginning, because people are proud of him and what he did.
"How can you not stop him?" said Katz.
But it'll only take a few weeks.
To go further, you have to dance.
Skarlatos, who is Burlac and wants to become a cop, says he's been having fun in this totally unknown environment so far.
The program represented the hardest battle, since it was often necessary to travel to Los Angeles between the moments when it was announced in the medium and the various awards.
He said that at the end of August, when he returned to the U.S. right after the train incident, he just wanted to relax with his family.
"That lasted about a day and a half," he said.
In total, I've been home for four days.
There is a risk of being caught by a person who draws the attention of the media, but it is not common to be in the light of the reflectors, said executive producer Wade.
And the show wants to ensure that the competition improves and is fun.
"The pressure is great and we want participants to have a pleasant experience," said Wade.
"I didn't want Alek ever to say, "Oh, what did I get into?"
Let's keep the puppies enjoying themselves.
McRib from McDonald's coming back.
The time has come for those who wait all year for the sandwich with pig meat in the form of mini-costs to enjoy.
But how is it harder to find this year?
The CNBC reports that only 55% of McDonald's French from the country offers this season specialty.
Last year, 75% of the restaurants served the McRib sandwich.
"At the 2015 McRib promotion, approximately 8,000 restaurants," said McDonald's spokesman, Lisa McComb, for The Times in an e-mail.
In the USA there are fewer than 14,300 restaurants of this fast-food.
However, according to McComb, the individual owners of France decided whether or not to serve McRib.
"Participation is not significantly different than last year," McComb says.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu they consider to be desired by their local customers.
And if you're still wondering what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain the ingredients last year, with a video clip to show the reality.
According to the video clip, McRib sandwich is prepared from pig meat, water, dextrose and condoms.
The sandwich will be available by the end of the year at McDonald's restaurants participating.
There is also a web site with locations where McRib (not affiliated to McDonald's), which may be useful.
People can report on the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and can search for the nearest place to use this sandwich.
However, a quick search on the site shows that the nearest restaurant with McRib from Los Angeles is located in Sebastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.
Sometimes I just can't fight with the BBQ pizza pot.
Keith Richards understands that new registrations would be prepared for Rolling Stones
Keith Richards is again in the light of the reflections with a new solo album and an appearance in a documentary, but soon, and the other members of the Rolling Stones team could join them in the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others from Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - met recently in London and made "clear registration plans", as he says.
Last night, Richards spoke in the ICONS series from iHeartRadio with reporter Jim Kerr.
A possible new album from Stones would be the first LP of the team after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But the team wasn't at all inactive.
In recent years they have had many tournaments on stadiums and sing in more small concerts in L.A., including those represented at the Echoplex and the Theater Fund.
Finally, they replayed the 1971 classic LP, "Sticky Fingers".
In particular Richards was occupied this year, working on the document ‘Keith Richards: Under the Influence’ scheduled to be launched on 18 September at Netflix.
This year, he released the album only "Crosseyed Heart", his third solo in a five-year career.
Randy Lewis from The Times described Richards' new album in an earlier interview with the guitarist: "The voice of Richards is always a kinder instrument than otherwise..."
But Richards tears in all 15 album songs and this has always meant rock 'n' roll.
In the interview, Richards says the team will enter the most likely studio after the South American tournament from the beginning of next year.
He didn't give other details, but, judging after the last concert, the team is still very full of life.
The Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman about childhood, maturity and "The Family Fang"
Jason Bateman has already passed through some difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet drug that made them look much simpler than they were actually.
When a child actor on television such as "Silver Spoons" as an adult was reaffirmed in the role of an unexpressed typical in the "Crade Situation" television series and in films such as "Cash Chiefs".
The first film he worked as director was a very acid comedy "Bad Words", in which he also played.
The film was nominated at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with "The Family Fang", the second film he ruled, an ambitious film from a tone point of view, the adaptation of Kevin Wilson's 2011 popular novel. The scenario is written by David Lindsay-Abire, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and in the film Nicole Kidman and Bateman, in the role of the brothers with problems.
The film is subject to a festival that seeks American distribution.
Many book reviews considered it a comedy with powerful emotional attempts; the film replays the story, placing the more emphasis on its dramatic, darker nature.
In an interview with our March publication, Bateman says he has always considered the book more a drama than a comedy.
"I've never seen the book like this," he testified.
In books, subjects and subjects are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin was addressing a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So it was always the order in which I saw things, a drama with moments of frivolity and comedy and eccentricity.
The world's first Monday evening benefited from an introduction by the director of the festival's program, Kerri Craddock, who expressed his enthusiasm in particular towards the "The Hogan Family" site from the late 1980s and the early 1990s, where Bateman worked. "We didn't meet too many fans "Hogan Family", said Bateman sad when he rode on the stage.
However, the few episodes he ruled out from that site brought Bateman, now at the age of 46, to Directors Guild at the age of 18.
The story of his new film has a family called Fang in the center.
Parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are artists with an average reputation, best known for the way their children, Annie and Baxter, in their performances, for example by putting on the street a bank Jaff with cards or playing the role of very weak street musicians.
At age, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) are trying to find their own identity.
Annie is attracted to any hunger, although she is more famous for public scandals than for performance, and Baxter is a novelist and journalist who tries to get fame.
When Caleb and Camille disappear in mysterious trials, Annie and Baxter admit that it's just another trick of theirs and try to discover the truth about their parents and find new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to see what's happening to the actors who want to evolve into adult life has reflected directly and deeply in Bateman.
"My childhood was very typical," says Bateman.
I started acting when I was 10 years old, with my parents as manager, and this movie has many elements that are superior to the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story about a superficial and funny story.
"It's a story I feel about and I understand it deeply," he added, "and, although I didn't try to add my personal experience to it, I knew very clearly how to show this film to represent children with a non-traditional childhood."
The project started with Kidman, and she was the producer of the film that acquired the rights for Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write his own adaptation, he was captured Lindsay-Abaire, who adapted his own play "Treaty to Reality", where he played Kidman.
Bateman testifies that he accepted the chance to manage the film and play it.
(Kidman, currently on the London stage in the production of Photograph 51, did not participate in the month's premium.
The author of the book was found in public.)
In Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Bateman's film "a smart and caustic adaptation" which "gives to the most exploited type of cell phone of the dysfunctional family and sometimes takes away the mission from life to understand their parents in ways that can be fun and sweet- old, incisive and usually very dark".
In Variety, Justin Chang called the film "a very narrow portrait" and said that Bateman "shows visible progress and greater maturity than film director with this intelligently structured adaptation, but never too narrow or mechanical".
After the month's project, when Bateman and Walken took the stage for the question session, the public ovated him along the Walken multi-dead.
Regarding Bateman as director and actor, Walken said during the question session that "I was impressed every day.
I didn't come to believe the ease with which it changes the film's director's work, which is very difficult, and on the actor's stage.
His concentration is really amazing.
In a certain dialogue scene, Bateman is sitting on a floor of the family's house behind the room, hiding in the bathroom, just a shade from the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and sees more clearly.
It's not hard to imagine the Bateman actor talking to the Bateman director about the fact that he can't be seen.
"I think it's incredible that I'm interested in filming," Bateman said.
All my decisions come from this, I never take them to benefit me as an actor.
Having the position privileged to be responsible for creating the entire experience for the public, not just one instrument in that orchestra, being an actor, is a whole thing.
Without knowing that that... actor wants a primary plan.
During the question and answer session, Bateman testified that, after reading the scenario, he immediately thought of Walken for Caleb's role, but also Carter Burwell for the sound column.
Especially known for the long-standing friendship with the Coen brothers, Burwell composed the sound column for two other films present at the Toronto festival: the "Anomalis" animation film - a story of love and isolation directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Gangsters of legend", by Brian Helgeland about the English band of the 1960s, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell composed the sound column and for Todd Haynes' "Carol" film.
"The things with added tones or gains seem very interesting to me," says Bateman, giving more explanations on March.
Navigate through those tones and guide the public in harmony and as elegant from one to the next, throughout the film.
Carter built his career and an incredible reputation as a person who can navigate through the most complex tunnels.
With "The Family Fang", Bateman took another bold step, both as a director and as an actor, in a career dominated by reincarnation and decision, a mixture of comedy and drama, light and darkness.
After Bateman testified when he finished the introduction of the film at the World Moon Prize, "Well, unfortunately, it came out exactly as I wanted".
The festival is looking like the Oscars about the history of Boston Globe polls about pedophile priests
Have you won $240,000 in the lottery?
An X-LOTTO ticket worth more than $240,000 is not required for a month.
The unregistered ticket to the X-Lotto extraction was purchased from the English Farm Shopping Centre on Montague Rd on Saturday, August 15th.
Along with the winning ticket sold in South Australia, 16 other winning entries have been registered throughout Australia, which have contributed to the estimated X-Lotto prize fund of $4 million.
SA Lotteries asks all those who bought tickets to X-Lotto from England Farm Lotteries Kiosk to check them out as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from the X-Lotto extract 3555 Saturday, August 15, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
The additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, the manager of English Farm Lotteries Kiosk, says he is waiting patiently to receive the good news that the one who won the great prize and verified the ticket at X-Lotto.
"We have tried to spread the news in response, because a person is our winner and has no bad idea," she said.
Detectives from the crime scene perpetrate the house on the streets of Beadell, Burton, where he was last seen missing man Daniel Hind
Her sister, Chelsea Hind, said it's frustrating to wait for information about her brother missing, especially because the police offered two different versions of this night's course that was last seen.
Her family asked the police to chase her home from her brother's disappearance.
"We hope they'll search the house, we weren't informed that they'll do it," she said.
Mrs. Hind says she wants her family as well as those who knew what was going on with her brother to speak and tell the truth to the police.
"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We're four children and we have many other family members and half of us believe he's alive somewhere, and the other half thinks he's not.
Anyway, we don't want him home and finish the story.
Until 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 kilometres of road
By 2022, the Bulgarian government plans to build 635 kilometres of new roads and repair 17,000 kilometres of existing major and secondary roads.
The finalisation of the work for Hemus, Stream, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina, all part of the pan-European transport corridor, is among the priorities of the plans for the development of the approved roads.
The plan aims to create a sustainable forest infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure increased security of forests and efficient transport management of forests, the government said.
Bulgaria is a transit country for the traffic of cultural goods in Syria
According to Interior Minister Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for illicit trafficking of cultural goods stolen from the Middle East due to its geographical expansion.
During a Wednesday's speech at a conference on the fight against Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgaria's national legislation was rejected in order to conform to the new context, stressing the prohibition of cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Press Agency (BTA), said that the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of the Interior, in particular of the Directorate-General for the fight against organised crime (GDBOP), focused on preventing contraband and selling illegal Bulgarian cultural objects.
He stated that Bulgaria is a country with a rich history, where recent studies have placed it on the third place, following Italy and Greece, in the field of trade in objects and cultural goods.
The Ministry of Interior of Bulgaria has further shown that the trafficking of cultural objects and the destruction of historical sites in such areas as Iraq and Syria is a phenomenon that has taken place, describing a crime of extremely serious war.
He stressed the need for concerted and decisive measures to prevent the intended destruction of history.
Director General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, said that films of illegal archaeological discoveries in Syria demonstrate that the country is affected by industrial theft.
The participants at the Wednesday conference recognized that Syria's cultural heritage was seriously threatened and that the international community must unite in order to stop the illegal traffic of cultural goods in the war-torn country.
Rockedyne says the program for the new AR-1 engine could be modified.
Tuesday, Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc stated that it is expected to finalise a new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a Russian engine that will soon be banned, but the date could be changed if it does not receive enough funds from the US government.
Vice-President Aerojet, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to give the statement on the fact that Aerojet offered US$ 2 billion to buy the United Launch Alliance (ULA), a mixed company with equal shares for rocket launch by Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.
Analysts say the proposed amount is a strategic move of Aerojet to cross the Blue Origin River, a company owned by founder Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, who develops a new engine ULA wants to use for its new Vulcan rocket.
ULA says that the Blue Origin engine program is about two years before the AR-1 engine in Aerojet, a statement that Aerojet has a counter.
The work on new engines became priority after the US legislators adopted a ban on the use of Russian RD-180 engines for launch of American military or spying satellites, following the accession of the Ukraine Crime Region by Russia last year.
Van Kleeck says that Aerojet tests hardware for engine, which is designed with three-dimensional print parts to fit both atlas 5 and ULA, now fed by the RD-180 engine, and in the new Vulcan rocket that develops ULA and costs about $1 billion.
The aircraft says it will be less costly and less risky to integrate the engine into Atlas 5 than to develop a new engine and a complete new rocket, as ULA currently thinks.
Van Kleeck says that Aerojet planned to start testing on a large scale in 2017, followed by the receipt of the certificate in 2019, but the date could be postponed if the company does not receive enough funds from the Air Force in contracts expected at the end of the first half of the fiscal year 2016, which begins in October.
It further states that the entire company was impatient to see how the Air Force will share a funding of approximately US$160 million between rival competitors.
He also says that Aerojet was planning to try other private financing options for the engine, but did not provide details.
Competition from the Air Force is a public-private partnership and each of the bidders must provide a third of the funding, and Air Force covers two thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies (Space Exploration Technologies), or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both being private companies, and they have autofinanced the engine's creation process and say that they are not looking for government funding.
AB InBev's beer producer intends a fusion of US$ 275 billion with SABMiller
Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the world's largest beer producer company, approached SABMiller (SAB.L) rival company in connection with a takeover that would form a colos that would produce a third of the world's total beer.
Such a merger would have a market value of about US$ 275 billion at current prices and would combine AB InBev' domination in Latin America with the SABMiller in Africa, both representing markets with rapid development, but also with their beer factories in Asia.
"The real attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but some places in Asia and Latin America," analyst Andrew Holland from the General Society said.
AB InBev and other top beer producers are trying to enter new markets and strengthen the weak points in North America and Europe, where consumers prefer the beer produced by independent players or wine or spirit drinks.
SABMiller, the world-wide company and the producer of more than 200 beer brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said Wednesday that it was informed of AB InBev's intention to make an offer, which must take place late until 14 October, in accordance with British law.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private capital fund administered by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, renowned for its policy of reducing costs on marketing satellite, orchestrated the previous purchase of Burger King, Heinz ketchup producer (KHC.O) and Kraft Foods.
A close source of SAB said it's too early to say what he's going to do, because they didn't get any offer.
"At this point, we are in the stage waiting and deciding," said the source.
Speculations on a merger, which would likely raise concerns about the infringement of competition rules on markets such as the United States and China, have circulated for more than a few years.
The moment of the approach, after a better decade of purchases by AB InBev, follows a fall of approximately 15% of the SABMiller shares price starting from August.
"It's exactly the time he's expected," said analyst Phil Gorham from Morningstar.
From a financial point of view, for the first time in many years, it is logical.
AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds (62 USD) for SAB Miller's action, maybe 45 pounds, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of up to USD 130 billion, which would also include SABMiller's debt.
This would make the most significant M&A transaction in 2015, which is already announced a year after the 2008 financial crisis from the point of view of the amount of the transaction, and one of the largest purchases since 1980.
SAB's actions reached 19.9% to 36.14 litres, giving it a gross capitalisation of $90 billion.
AB InBev actions reached 6.4%.
Rivali Heineken (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) argue that SAB could seek another merger as a defence strategy, as happened last year when Heineken was offered to buy, but failed.
Since then, he has combined the African bottler of sweet drinks with the Coco-Cola (KO.N) and in the last week there was a bathroom of a combination with Diageo or with an Australian Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX).
The overall market share of AB InBev, the manufacturer of Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was 21.1% in 2014, while SABMiller was 15%, according to experts from the Plato Logic industry.
AB InBev intends a report between the net debt and the gross profit (EBITDA) 2 times from 2.5 of this year.
It is possible to achieve the goal in 2016, the most realistic date for which the transaction could be concluded, so that it would have a way to borrow to finance a purchase.
When he bought Budweiser's company, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 with USD 52 billion, the biggest purchase of ice money in the history of that time, he let the report grow over 5 times.
Such a great deal would allow her to accumulate a debt of 100 billion.
Families controlling AB InBev have fewer than half of the company, while the two main shareholders from SABMiller are the producer of Altria (MO.N) and Santo Domingo family in Colombia.
On Wednesday, Others refused to give the statement that they were approached by AB InBev, but, on 9 September, its financial director, Billy Gifford, said in a review conference that the investment in SAB Miller is regularly evaluated and that "this time we consider that maintaining assets is in the interest of our shareholders".
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for the statements.
Neil Dwana, head of European, equityd investment, to the Alliance Global Investors, which has actions in both companies, says AB InBev has faced a growing pressure to return the numbering surplus to shareholders.
ABI pays a very high price, but the accumulation of small debt revenues is somewhere around 15%.
But we believe that the profit derived from this purchase would be an 8% discount, after 10 years," Dwana said.
In any combination there are significant difficulties related to the infringement of competition rules, particularly in the United States, where companies have approximately 70% of the beer market.
"The economies that could be made in distribution operations are large, and the obstacles to the violation of competition rules are even greater," said Erik Gordon, professor at the Ross School of Business at Michigan University.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Coach to obtain 58 per cent of the company's shareholding SABMiller, in accordance with the operating agreement that governs it.
A change of control at SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to get 8% more and to appoint a new executive director of the company.
Molson, with his seat in Denver, would have the right to the first and last offers for the rest of 50 percent.
A spokesman for Molson refused to comment on whether the company is interested in a tender, but Molson’s actions have increased by over 12 per cent, to their highest value.
Any merger could also have to sell shares in China, where market leader is the association in the CR Snow of SABMiller with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao from China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that, after retirement, the combined group could have a 28% share of the global market.
AB InBev is advised by Lazard, and SAB Miller is advised by Robey Warshaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.
Pakistani police accused an old Air Force pilot of helping Qaeda
The Pakistani police arrested an old Air Force pilot who would have given further funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, in a rare case to those who support activism.
The suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was detained in the southern city of Karachi.
This paid for the treatment of injured Taliban soldiers at a hospital in the Aesthetic City of Lahore, the police said.
He also influenced two military officers involved in a month's attack on a bus with members of the Muslim and Islamic minority, who then died 45 people, told the senior police officer Naveed Khawaja of the Ministry of Counter-Terrorism of the province.
This will be accused of financing terrorism, Khawaja said.
"Ahmed has funded the Afghans more, we are still doing research to see whether he has provided financial assistance through his business or behind him," said the officer.
"Al Qaeda is also providing further financial assistance for AQIS," he said, referring to Al Qaeda organisation on the Indian Subcontinent, an Al Qaeda framework founded one year later.
This arrest is a rare success for the Pakistani police forces, who are facing activism, corruption and crime.
After, in December, the Taliban were massacred by about 150 people, mostly children, at an army school, the government swore to break up the activism.
There have been severe attacks, while the army has also advanced, and more in tribal regions beyond the law border with Afghanistan.
However, the military groups remain a threat and many have adopted from Pakistani cities under the control of very poorly prepared police forces and insufficient funds.
Ahmed, at 52 years of age, used to preach in a mosque in the good area of the Karachi Army Housing Authority.
His public sermons were moderate, but, in particular, encouraged radicalism, the police declared it.
He studied at the Pakistan Air Force College in the city of Sargotha and left the Pakistan Air Force in 1998, another security officer announced to Reuters under anonymized.
He later entered the textile industry and chemical substances.
The rapper Rick Ross rejected the author's application for "Everyday I'm Hustlin"
The new Yorkese rapper Rick Ross can't claim copyright for the words "Everyday I'm Hustlin'," decided an American judge, revoking his complaint against the LMFAO musical group, who sold tricks with a similar verse, "Everyday I'm Shufflen'".
In a decision published in March of the Miami federal court, district judge Kathleen Williams said that Ross's slogan, part of his initial hit in 2006, "Hustlin" is a short statement for which courts have repeatedly mentioned that he cannot receive copyright.
Williams' judicial decision weakens the process of violating the copyrights that Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, tried against LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that Los Angeles's due electropopist, quoted by Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin" for their own famous melody from 2010, "Party Rock Anthem", which contains the verse "Everyday I'm Shufflin".
The old hip hop said that LMFAO melody is "a clear attempt to capitalise the fame and success of the Hustlin melody".
He also gave Kia Motors a trial for the use of the "Party Rock Anthem" melody in a advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed that LMFAO violated his author's right to sell tricks and other products with shufflin slogan.
In the March judgment, Williams says "Hustlin" as a melody is protected by copyright law.
But Ross's three-word slogan is derived from ordinary words and cannot have copyright, she said.
The judge compared him to other famous verses in the music of the past, such as "you got the right one, uh-huh", "hella back" and "we get it poppin'", saying it's "a short expression, which all courts have declared it unanimously impossible to place under copyright".
The judge did not decide whether LMFAO's melodia is an unauthorized copy of the Hustlin'.
The process is scheduled for October.
Ross and LMFAO's lawyers could not be contacted immediately for the statements.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. v. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al, U.S. District Court for Southern District, Florida, No.

Dr. Carson approaches Trump in the most recent presidential poll of the Republican Party
According to the most recent presidential poll for 2016, new politician Ben Carson is approached by bombing leader Donald Trump in the preliminary republican elections.
Carson got 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush dropped in seven-point surveys.
After Trump's 27% support in the most recent CBS/New York Times survey, Carson, retired neurosurgery, comes to second place by 23%, followed by Bush by Mike Huckabee, from Florida's Senator Marco Rubio, each with 6%.
Support from the Republican votes in the preliminary elections increased from the beginning of August to the beginning of September for Trump, Carson, governor of Ohio John Kasach and former Executive Director of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
The support for the last two remains, however, at the number of one digit.
Jeb Bush, who was governor of Florida and who is leading far away from Bush's standards, fell by seven percentage points in one month, while Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker fell by eight points.
Last Sunday, Walker's support is 2%.
Carson has received more support than Trump among university graduates (29% to 21%), while Trump is before Carson in the university-free voters' preferences (30% to 19%).
Trump is supported by more men than women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of respondents to the survey said they were determined to support the preliminary elections in their state.
Those who said I know who will vote with him two times more on Trump than Carson.
It is still too early to say 63% of Republican voters for the preliminary elections.
The results of the CBS/NYT survey held between 9 and 13 September will be made public on Tuesday, before a presidential debate.
Carson's resignation in this poll reflects the position of Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders in front of the leader for the nomination of democracies to the presidency, former State Secretary Hillary Clinton.
The last follow-up to the CBS presidential nominations shows that Sanders has reached 10 points and 22 points in Iowa, New Hampshire, respectively, among the democratic voters for the preliminary ruling.
An ethical renouncing expert says that sex robots should be banned
An ethical renomist from the robotic industry launched a campaign which called for a ban on the development of sex robots.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, a robotic expert at the University of Leicester, England, warns that sexual robots could contribute to the systematic dehumanization of women and children.
"Sexive robots seem to represent an increasingly important subject in the robotic industry, and the models from which they are inspired - the way they will show what roles will be - are very disturbing," she said to the BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sex robots is not a fight against sex, it's against exploitation.
Technology isn't neutral.
It's inspired by class, race and gender.
Political power inspires the development of technology," she said for Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will contribute to the increase in sexual exploitation.
Although the sex robots that are now manufactured are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that this represents the first step towards something smaller.
It's a new and urgent technology, but we have to stop it from the front.
I'm sure the industry seems to be making progress.
A few years ago, the true Company launched Roxxxy, "the first sex robot in the world".
However, concern about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence is not unusual, even among large industrial representatives.
Even this spring, the executive director of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk, wrote about “the risk that within five years something really dangerous will happen.
In an interview with BBC last December, physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that "the development of a complete artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race".
Great Britain strikes first refugees from Syria - RT UK
In the following days, the British Navy will receive the first refugees who have fled the course of the Syrian war, announced Interior Minister Theresa May.
These will receive assistance under the extensive government reinstallation programme.
Refugees seeking asylum from the camps at the border with the country of war.
These are the first of the 20,000 refugees the United Kingdom plans to receive by 2020.
In a speech in the House of Commons, the Minister of the Interior stated that the government "work fast" to ensure more fate.
In the process of receiving the United Kingdom of vulnerable refugees, it is imperative that the assistance and support they need and deserve already be given.
I know that members and the general public want to find out more about the number of persons and the date on which their arrival is expected.
May mentioned that the government must also make more plans to ensure that refugees have adequate supplies when they arrive.
I need to emphasize that the level of enlargement requires careful and methical planning to ensure that everything is done properly.
Me and the Syrian refugee minister, Richard Harrington, will continue to keep the House present in this regard.
But I am pleased to say to the House that we are waiting for the first wave of refugees in the coming days and we are working fast for planning more events in the weeks to come.
Prime Minister David Cameron drew the anger of parliamentarians and the military when he revealed the plan for government refugees, many thinking that the number was too small.
In September, Cameron said in the House of Commons that the United Kingdom "will rise to its moral responsibility" and will receive 20,000 refugees from the camps in the Middle East until the next general elections.
He added that refugees will not receive full asylum automatically, but a humanitarian status that will allow them to apply for asylum after five years.
But critics have noted that the figures meant only 12 refugees per day, and former liberal democratic MP Paddy Ashdown said the measures are "desirous".
Furthermore, Ashdown revealed that children included in this scheme will be deported when they are 18 years old if they don't get asylum.
Also, prominent public personalities have condemned, on their own, the measures.
In a common letter, big names such as Benedict Cumberbach, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said the answer to the crisis is "too little, too late".
"It is a responsibility that must be shared with our neighbours of Europe, not just thrown into the depths of the surrounding countries of the conflicts that bring people out of their homes," they wrote.
Rubla refers to the global uncertainty fund - RT Business
The Russian rubla has been strengthened by the winter, with 65.66 in front of the US dollar and 73.98 in front of the Euro in Bursa from Moscow at 10:00 GMT.
In general, the Russian currency won seven percent of its lowest rate of 71 rubles for a dollar on August 24.
Analysts say that the return of the ruble has been caused by the reaction of investors to current global market disturbances resulting from China's difficulties, the possible increase in the U.S. Federal Reserve profit rate and the excessive response to the oil spill.
The Brents grew by 61 cents on Wednesday, reaching USD 48.36 per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded 72 cents more, at USD 45.31 per barrel.
MORE MULTs: The most likely, the profit rate will grow in the US by the end of 2015 - US Fed
"It is possible to say the word, fueled by uncertainty about China and at the time of the increase in the federal profit rate, which will continue to give the tone for oil prices and for rubles," said Bloomberg Piotr Matys from Rabobank, an expert in monetary policies on emerging markets, established in London.
Experts also point to another factor that explains the strengthening of the Russian currency.
The Russian oil company's chiefs Lukoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are related to the US dollar, began to buy rubles.
The global markets are waiting with the spirit of the Federal Reserve's decision on whether or not the rate of profits will increase.
Markets believe that what might not be the first increase in the US profit rate in nine years will not be happening and they have traded to larger markets on Wednesdays.
Nasa and the United Kingdom work together in the drone traffic system
NASA already works with US government and companies such as Google, Amazon and Verizon telephone company to develop a database that allows drone pilots to reserve air space blocks for flights.
Nothing at EU level has yet to be established.
Co-operation is the result of a very widespread ignorance about the possibility of an air collision between small drones and commercial aircraft.
A new Forrester report describes in colors the potential negative effect.
"Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies delivering products or capture data in urban areas with high density, such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco," says the research.
Without a common set of technological protocols and air rules, the chaos could be installed.
According to Détta O'Cathain, Baroness of the Lorzilor Room, concern was compounded on the basis of the reports on events at the limit of the production of an accident and the operation of drones over football stadiums, near the nuclear centres and the Eiffel Tower.
"In the last two years, over 400 appeals to the metropolitan police have been linked to drone incidents," O'Cathain said.
The solution is: to build a system that follows all drones, especially those flying at a height of less than 150 metres, whether they are driven by commercial or amateur pilots.
"As more small drones perform commercial flights at low altitudes, beyond the pilot's level of visibility or even completely autonomous flights, any infrastructure management of air traffic is required to separate flights, with a view to ensuring the safety of complex operations, such as the delivery of collections in the city," she said.
According to Nasa, this drone traffic management system will include services such as air space design, methods to avoid adverse weather conditions and winds, congestion management, track planning and redirection by similar methods to the rules laid down for road traffic, such as signalling and gas.
This is expected to have a functional prototype by 2019.
The drone industry has been operating in the European Union for the next few years.
"We have already seen small and innovative SMEs from the United Kingdom using this technology with significant effects on the energy, agriculture and media industries," says Lord Tariq.
More than 670 operating permits for commercial drone operations were granted only in the United Kingdom by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.
The European Commission estimates that the drone industry could generate 150 000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
Disciplinary button: why Facebook wants to know what's bothering you
"A Look Back" works similarly, adding the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will this mean for many users within the virtual boundaries of Facebook, which are now more than the population of any country?
First of all, of course, an empathy button will allow Facebook to understand you better.
The huge value of Facebook - approximately US$ 240 billion after the latest statistics - is due to the amount of unmapped data about consumers that it holds.
Each interaction, postagement, appreciation and friendship you make are collected and build a remarkable picture of the complex, found in a permanent update, about your person and about the preferences you have.
This is valuable primarily for advertising agencies, which can use all this information to carefully select which people see on Facebook ads, selecting those who are interested in most of their products.
An empathy button adds another set of data and, of course, opens a door for another type of advertising agents to use the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who "appreciate" a national football team, charity organisations and promoters want to address those who, for example, "impathize" with the refugee crisis.
It will also likely change what you see on the News.
Facebook uses incredible algorithms of intelligent and sophisticated minds to restrict that huge content universe you could see in the smaller flow you actually see.
This algorithm depends essentially on what you considered interesting in the past and, in particular, what you liked.
There is no doubt on Facebook that many interesting posts, but unfortunate ones don't enter the algorithm, because people don't feel they should be appreciated.
However, if Facebook understands more about what angers you or makes you feel unhappy, it may decide to remove this kind of post from News.
Facebook has performed past experiments to understand how what you see in News affects your emotional state and, in particular, how this is transmitted from one person to another.
Academic environmental representatives call this "emotional contamination" and, although it sounds left, it is likely just a simple Facebook attempt (and published open, with their agreement) to understand better how their platform works and whether they can adjust the algorithms to distribute more elements.
What's going to happen with the empathy button remains on Facebook.
The real challenge is how a single company's decision to add a single button to its services can produce such speculation.
The reason for this may be the fact that the decisions made by Facebook - whether it involves the visible buttons we see or the invisible algorithms that work secretly - have profound consequences for us today.
Now we are enjoying a significant part of life in the digital world, which we access to find anything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and another that leads to a constant struggle for survival in the world of generous technology and social networks.
The decisions taken, including with regard to the new buttons, will be considered the most appropriate to remain on the surface in this course.
I think many people can feel it and soon they'll have a button for this.
Biometric storms can predict crises in people with autism
During the ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team have found that the body's signals can anticipate these changes, sometimes violent, before they occur, thus giving the assistants the opportunity to take appropriate measures.
The kids with autism we work with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say it hurts her head or it's "it's too dirty here" or "I don't like this teacher".
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body transmits to us, and we need to do this in a smooth and non-intrusive way.
For example, simple coloring in an application can show the level of agitation. Red can be used to warn about a behavioural change and the whiteness for lack of interest, giving the assistant understanding that the person is tired and needs encouragement.
The crash data can be collected in time and saved on a secure server, helping caregivers to understand the collection image of the type in which the person responds to various situations and which would be the most appropriate intervention.
I have to say very clearly that we don't read the mind.
Biometric sensors are not magic, they need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team will work with producers to further develop this technology to be specific for autism.
The research was appreciated by Jane Carolan, Director of Services for Customers at the Wirral Autistic Society, who will present technology at the Autech 2015 conference on autism and technology from Manchester on 1 October.
When you work with people who suffer from severe autism, as we do, you see the spectacular difference that can bring them into the quality of their life of assistance technology. Now, applications for iPad give themselves a voice of people who have never spoken.
The robots help your kids learn how to play when you're hiding.
"Who knows where this innovation could lead us," she says.
Assistive technologies can really change life and we feel that they are part of our mission, as a charitable organisation for autism, to ensure that all have access to this information and are also part of the discussion of how we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack Isis in Syria "in the next few weeks"
In the following weeks, French warplanes will launch air raids on Isis tanks in Syria, announced government Wednesday, just a few days after President François Hollande said the intervention was a "need".
France will launch the first air raids on the group Jihadist Islamic State in Syria "in the following weeks," Minister of Defence Jean-Yves Le Drian said Wednesday.
The French Air Force sends recognition missions to Syria on 8 September, and the attacks will follow "in the following weeks, as we will have clearly identified," Le Drian said for France Inter radio station.
The Drian said Tuesday in parliament that the Islamic State has made "very significant progress" in Syria, especially in the northern Aleppo region.
"In the city of the Sea has an extremely offensive place of power, and if it succeeds, it could destroy what we still call the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian National Coalition or what remains of it," he said.
France is part of a U.S.-led coalition that has been bombing Isis' positions in Iraq for one year, but Holland has changed last week's strategy to extend actions in Syria, under conditions where political pressure accumulates at the base of the Jihadist threat facing France.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf states have already been involved in attacks on Isis soldiers in Syria.
IOS 9 advertising blocking feature will make your phone faster
The newest version of iOS 9 is released Wednesday and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and worried about online editors - is the ability to easily block ads during web browsing.
The new feature will allow users to download third extensions that block cookies, ads, pop-up windows and other types of advertising while using the version for the Safari mobile browser from Apple.
In the test, it has been shown that, after blocking ads, news sites like New York Times are charged twice as fast as Reuters.
In addition, blocking advertising helps users to preserve their use of data and battery autonomy.
Users will benefit from more options to block ads, including 1Blocker, Blockr and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular desktop advertising blocker, launched its own web browser iOS that limits ads; its creator intends to launch an extension for Safari in the future.
People who use software to block ads are facing a number of obstacles.
Advertising is still in use (from here Apple earns money on iOS).
More and more media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, are trying to prevent their visitors from using such advertising blocking features.
However, their use on desktop computers increased by almost 48% in the previous year.
Their development raises major challenges for online media, which is mostly offered free of charge to consumers and is supported for many years by advertising.
One report says that blocking advertising could cost online editors nearly 22 billion in revenues generated from advertising only this year.
In order to enable iOS 9, users need to download an application for blocking ads, then access Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to enable an extension for blocking content.
Both talk about terrorism and the crisis of immigrants with the Spanish kings
President Barack Obama met King Felipe VI of Spain in March at the White House, where the two discussed a number of subjects, but they probably reduced the importance of international cooperation.
Both kings have addressed the subject of the war against the Islamic State and the increasingly pressing crisis of immigrants in Europe - which has already faced hundreds of thousands of people who have left the country of origin to go west.
"Spain has worked very hard to deal with this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are often involved in very dangerous travel and trafficking in persons," Obama said.
Of course, the problem's got worse in the last few months.
Obama also stressed the importance of cooperation, especially in the context of the Spanish territory of Catalonia's vote in the elections that will take place this month.
"As far as foreign policy is concerned, we have worked hard to maintain relations with a strong and united Spain," Obama said.
The superior commander told King Felipe that he would like to visit the country before the end of his mandate in 2017.
"We will receive you with our arms open," replied Philip.
First lady, Michelle Obama, made the queen a tour of the White House and had a tea discussion.
It was the first visit of the royal couple in the United States since the inauguration of the throne.
After they left Washington, they followed up on a visit to South Florida.
Alfred Woodard joins the "Luke Cage" series team
Famous actress Alfred Woodard has joined the distribution of the next series Netflix Luke Cage from Marvel. He will be an antagonist of Mike Colter, who plays the role of the superhero that gives the title of the series.
Woodard will play the role of Mariah Dillard - "a local politician from Harlem and vice-president of Cornell "Cottonmouth" Stokes, recently announced by Mahershala Ali - who intends to bring an era of change on the streets that it has grown," says a press release.
Her personal life and career are given to her over her head by Harlem's newest hero, Luke Cage, but also by the famous actions of her husband, Cottonmouth.
"Alfre has an incredible, unique and inspiring presentation on the screen, which makes it perfect for Harlem community leader," says Jeff Loeb, executive producer and President Marvel Television.
We are pleased that an actress as famous and talented as Alfred has agreed to join us in this adventure.
The series will be held in 2016.
Cheo Hodari Cooker will write the first two episodes and will work as a showrunner and an executive producer.
Woodard, aged 62, is known for the TV series Hill Street Blues, St. Elswhere, L.A. Law, Desperate News and Law Law, but also for the movies The Devil's lawyer, the mysterious Obsession, The Family That Preys, 12 years of slavery and Annabelle.
Luke Cage is one of the four Marvel series from Netflix.
Also, soon Jessica Jones and Iron Fist will be deployed, but also the second season of Daredevil.
"Scream Queens" and "Empiry" have the global prize on the same day
Fox provides many positive results before the second of its most expected series: Write Queens and Empire.
The first season of Queens and second season of Empire will be broadcast on all Fox International channels one day after the internal prize.
According to Variety, the strategy is a trend applied to high-profile series, as global social networks traffic ensures success.
"Hollywood realizes how important it is to value the common voice of sincere international fans, especially for the series that are very much spoken about, such as Empire and Writing Queens," said the President of Fox International, Hernan Lopez, according to the Deadline.
"We are just waiting to distribute these very interesting series for fans around the world," Lopez continued.
The viewers we serve every day bring the success of a series at the top and throughout its life cycle.
The next season of the Empire, in which they will play famous views such as Mariah Carey and Vivica A. Fox, has the prize in September.
The new Scream Queens series, which will play Emma Roberts and Ariana Grande, will be broadcast on the second day in September.
Members of the British royal family will participate in the world's "Spactre" film
Prince Harry and the Dukes and Duke of Cambridge will take part next month in London at the world's most recent film with James Bond, "Spect".
The Kensington Palace announced Wednesday's news on Twitter, calling the Royal Film Performance Award for Film and Television Benvolent Fund.
According to a press release by producers, "Spectre" is the third election Bond film since 1946.
In the past, royal prizes have been selected and "Don't die today" (2002) and Casino Royale (2006).
This year's event will take place on October 26, at Royal Albert Hall in London and will be a charity, which will benefit employees from the British film and television industry.
The film will also be played at the top, including the main actor Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomi Harris, David Baptista, Monica Bellucci and Ralph Fiennes.
The director Sam Mendes and the producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson will go on the red cover along with the royal family members.
"Special" will be released in the U.S. cinematographs in November.
There are complaints that Christie Brinkley and John Mellencamp would be together
Christie Brinkley's model and musician John Mellencamp were seen taking dinner together for months, observing the sound that the two would have a romantic relationship.
The two met to eat at the Bowery Hotel in New York City, where the photos surprised Brinkley with joy and enthusiasm.
The 61-year-old supermodel was seen wearing blues, thins and a yellow jacket, while the 63-year-old rock was dressed in broken blues, cottons and cisms.
Last year, in October, Mellencamp would have been seen again with his love disappearing and fighting constantly, the actress Meg Ryan.
Mellencamp praised the old message for you at today's NBC show, saying it was "an angel that was sent to me and I'm very happy".
He added that "nothing will end until it ends".
In August, Brinkley's youngest daughter, Sailor Brinkley Cook, introduced to Seventeen magazine, walking after her mother.
Architects are much bigger than they're gonna get a carbide
Many studies have highlighted species that have become more vulnerable because of the warmer climate, but global warming has proved beneficial to others.
One of these advanced species is the arctic species.
According to researchers from the Dartmouth College, the hottest temperatures in the Arctic region allowed the inhabitants of this area to appear earlier and to grow higher, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers from the John Sloan Dickey Centre for International Understanding from Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, used field observations to illustrate the effects of climate change on Arctic states.
Their analysis foresees a 50% increase in the survival rate of adult subjects under 2 degrees Celsius.
The patience is small, but it represents important members of the Arctic tropical and ecosystems.
The new analysis - detailed in a new work published in Procedures of the Royal Society B - aims to help biologists understand better how a growing population could affect carbon that feeds, birds and insects that feed on them and plants that pollinate them.
In order to build the demonstration, scientists from Dartmouth combined the results of laboratory experiments that researched how the temperature influences the development of insects and predictive of being poisoned by predators.
Although the increase in temperature makes it more vulnerable to the helicopters, it also offers them a early start in the spring and makes their child development faster and more efficient, which is certainly an advantage.
More endurance means a larger population, which can be developed only to the extent that it can support the food sources of insects.
The ability of holders to transform their improved survival rate into a improved reproduction rate depends on their ability to ensure their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the child
Three new studies show that the use of antidepressants in pregnant women has no effect on the neuronal or behavioural development of their children.
Studies have shown that selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs) present an increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have stated that depression is a higher risk for women and their children, which is therefore to be treated.
"These studies add to a increasingly large set of evidence on the safety of anti-depressive administration during the task," said John Thorp, the deputy editor of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, who published all three studies.
Although there are some increased risks, the evidence shows that the risks of net depression are higher than those of antidepressants.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health has coordinated a study on the engine development of children whose mothers have been treated with SSRI, analysing the data of 51 404 children in the Norwegian model study of mother and child, researching the effects of the use of SSRI for the development of motor skills at 3 years of age.
Researchers have discovered that 381 mothers used SSRI during pregnancy and 159 of them have been treated with medicines for an extended period.
Although the exposure to SSRI has been associated in any measure with a delay in engine development, researchers have written in the study that the association has “not been as significant as it would have been of clinical relevance”.
A group of researchers from Adelaide University of Australia conducted a data study for 49,000 Danish National Court women in order to discover the effects of SSRI administration on children up to 7 years of age.
The study found that untreated depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems.
Of the 210 children whose mothers were treated with depression with SSRI, there was no increased risk of behavioural problems, compared with 231 children who were more likely to have behavioural problems such as hyperactivity, lack of attention and socialization problems.
The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more predisposed to bleeding after birth if they are treated with SSRI.
Medical data from 30 198 who were born at a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal hemorrhage increased by 5%, between 11 and 16%, if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe haemorrhage or postnatal anaemia has doubled, researchers have reported.
Researchers said that although the study linked the administration of SSRIs to increased risk, there is a large number of variables – from medicines taken during birth to the limited amount of information available by researchers on the specific medical effects of women – which could have an impact on the bleeding potential.
"It is possible that women who have taken antidepressants at an advanced stage of duty to be those with the most serious stage of disease, and this is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal hemorrhage, not antidepressants," says Dr. Luke Grzeskovyak, professor at Adelaide University.
On the basis of this study, we do not recommend that women stop treatment against depression during pregnancy, but that they be closely monitored to reduce the risk of a potential bleeding.
Matthew is charged with murder of a student from Virginia Technical University.
The man accused of killing student Hannah Graham from Virginia University was charged with murder in the case of a student from Virginia Technical University who disappeared in 2009, the authorities announced March.
The jury from Albemarle, Virginia, has brought him under trial for Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr., 33 years old, from Charlottesville, for the murder of Morgan Harrington, officials say.
Also, Matthew is accused of rape with the intention of rape.
Each head of charge receives the maximum life imprisonment.
Harrington, 20 years old, disappeared from a Charlottesville concert in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Her parents say the charge news has made them easier.
"For six years we've been making decisions and being inexperienced in this regard," says Gil Harrington, Morgan's mother.
I'm glad to know that when you take someone's life, you have to bear the consequences for your fact.
For Jesse Matthew, the dominating pieces of the consequences began to be settled.
The police say there is a medical-legal relationship between Harrington, Graham cases and a 2005 sexual abuse by Fairfax County.
In June, Matthew was found guilty of this last and expected the sentence in this case.
He's staying in Charlottesville.
Jesse Matthew accused of murder qualified for the death of a student from the University of Virginia
Harrington was brought to U-Va on October 17, 2009, along with his friends at a metal concert.
The group got separated when Harrington came out of John Paul Jones Arena from Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and couldn't come back.
The last time he was seen trying to take a taxi around 20:30 in front of the arena.
Harrington was dressed with a black shirt with Pantera's crew.
After her disappearance, Harrington's phone and phone were found in the parking lot.
Family and friends started an extensive search for Harrington, a graduate of pedagogical studies, who wanted to become a professor. Metallica wrote about her disappearance on their website.
In November 2009, the shirt he wore was found near an apartment from Charlottesville.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated lake, in a farm in southwestern Charlottesville.
During Harrington's absence, Matthew worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it is not clear whether that period was over with the date Harrington disappeared.
The police say a significant advance in the destruction of Harrington case was represented by Matthew's arrest in the case of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officials who knew the investigation said these cases were linked to DNA evidence.
The investigators did not present the details of the new evidence that they decided to put Matthew under charge of Harrington's murder.
The defence attorney, Douglas Ramseur, who represents Matthew in Graham's case, refused to give the statement.
The announcement of the prosecution comes two days after a year of Hannah Graham's disappearance in September.
This case is similar to Harrington's case: both were young students who disappeared when they left town in Charlottesville.
Graham, 18 years old, from Fairfax County, was seen walking with Matthew in a mall in the center, near the U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later, after a national search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be judged for a qualified murder in the case of Graham.
In the first days following Graham's disappearance last night in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington represented a constant presence at the events and prizes organised for the student who disappeared from U-Va.
Harrington says he endured for her daughter speculations and criticisms in the media that must be reduced to silence by new charges against Matthew.
"In all this time there have been discussions of the kind "Why wear short wood?" and "And look for it with light?" but this type of question and judgment are not valid when it is clear that we have to do with a hunter on the trail of the thief," added Harrington.
In the case of Fairfax County, Matthew was convicted of sexual assault against a youth in 2005.
The woman, who was 26 years old at the time of the attack, told the jury that one evening in September, while she was coming home from the store, a stranger came after her.
He took her to a reverse area, beat her and kicked her in the neck, then attacked her sexual.
"I thought the end had come to me, that I had to step without delay," said the woman.
I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew took her to the run, told the woman.
A prosecutor told the jury that it is possible that Matthew might be scared of the dangers of a car entering a nearby parking lot.
He was convicted years later after DNA tests linked him to this case.
Matthew's gonna get the sentence in October.
Matthew will come for the first time to the trial in Harrington in Charlottesville tomorrow afternoon.
Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said that the most likely winter will come to Charlottesville and visit the bridge where his daughter was last seen.
"At least today I've taken another step," says Dan Harrington.

In an interview agreed to the Dutch Humo magazine, he said he knows what the duration of the contract or HBO post, according to Digital Spy.

Good news for Romania from the European Commission
The European Commission decided in March to redefine the payments for Romania under the "Economic Competitiveness" and "Medium" programmes, both suspended at the beginning of April 2015.
According to a communication from the representative of Romania of the European Commission following this Decision, approximately 120 million euros will be transferred to the Romanian authorities in the following period.
I am pleased to announce these payments and appreciate the efforts made by the Roman authorities to improve management and control systems within the framework of the two programmes.
It is important that the Roman authorities have been involved in identifying weaknesses and solving problems.
"I hope that business measures will significantly reduce the risk of errors and irregularities in the future," said European Commissioner for Regional Policy Corina Cretu.
"The extreme statements made by Mr Gianni Pitella are incorrect," replied the head of the Hungarian diplomat.
Peter Szijjarto asked European Socialists to initiate a "false campaign" at Hungary's address.
Referring to comments made by Harlem Desir, French State Secretary for European Affairs on Hungary's building wall, Szijarto stressed that Budapest "supports a common European strategy on immigration", while insisting that national borders must be protected.

The crisis of refugees: there is no solution
European Council President Donald Tusk announced that it will take a decision on the possible convening of a European Union summit on migration in Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann asked March to organise a European Union summit next week to resolve the refugee crisis.
At a joint press conference in Berlin, Merkel said that Germany, Austria and Sweden cannot manage the refugee crisis alone.
The German executive chief expressed his support for the recent decision taken by Berlin to impose border controls against the massive flow of asylum seekers, stating that the measure is aimed at facilitating the registration of refugees.
On the one hand, Slovakia - which opposes the European Commission's proposal to redistribution refugees between Member States on the basis of mandatory quotas - has been prepared for the organisation of an extraordinary EU summit.
EU Interior Ministers, meeting in Brussels on Monday evening, failed to adopt a new emergency redistribution proposal of 120,000 refugees between the Member States of the European Union, presented on 9 September by the European Commission.
The first point of the plan, represented by the emergency relocation mechanism for refugees, provides for the rapid redistribution of 54,000 refugees located in Hungary, 50,400 in Greece and 15,500 in Italy.
Charlie Hebdo, we're challenged charges
The French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo raises once again the question, following the publication of charges which undermine the response of European predominantly Christian dominant tariffs to the value of immigrants from predominantly Muslim war-affected territories.
In the most recent number of or, the publication has drawn attention again, as well as critics on social networks, writes Reuters agency.
One of these draws a fascinating picture of Aylan Kurdi, the innocent Syrian boy whose body arrived on one of Turkey's beaches after an attempt to cross the sea by boat from his family from Syria to Greece.
Charlie Hebdo's drawing shows a child in short and tricky pants, with the girl down on the edge of the sea, along a publishing panel that offers two menus for children at the price of one single.
"So close to success," is the message that goes into the drawing.
Another drawing, as well as the work of a cartoonist who survived the attack from the Paris editorial headquarters in January, is included in the message "The Truth That Europe Is a Christian".
The drawing also presents a character of Jesus, who goes on water, while a person with a smaller pair of short pants with his feet on top of the water, first saying "Christians go on water", the second "Muslim children are different".
The French magazine became a symbol of freedom of expression, after an attack on Islamists was launched in January, following repeated threats after the defeat of the prophet Mohammed.
A range of supermarkets present in Romania, a drastic amendment in Russia
The French auction of Auchan supermarkets was amended by over 370,000 Russian officials, accused of food security fraud.
Anna Popova, head of the Russian Consumer Protection Agency Rospotrebnadzor, said that the threats total over 25 million rubles, or $37,000, are related to Associated Press, quoted by US News.
The reasons for these threats were not exactly explained, and Auchan did not comment.
The French chain of supermarkets is also the main charge of the Russian agricultural agency, which claims that some meat products have been registered as infected with bacteria such as E.coli and Listeria.
Food controls come in a tense period between France and Russia on the issue of the extension of the European Union's sanctions and France's decision to cancel an understanding of the supply of Russian ships.
The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the shout that Hungary could raise a metal guard at our tatar border.
MAE shows that it has been briefed on this decision and that it is not a proper political gesture.
MAE appears, in a press release to Ziare.com, that it was informed by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this intention shortly before it was announced to the public.
On the contrary, the MAE informed the relevant decision-making factors in Romania in good time regarding this situation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that raising a guard between two Member States of the European Union and which are strategic partners is not a proper political gesture, in accordance with the European spirit.
This position has already been communicated to the ungulate party, it appears again in the communication.
Hungary plans to build a metal guard on a border segment with Romania, in the context of the immigration crisis, said in March Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, quoted by Mediafax.
"The measure is necessary because traffickers who pass Serbia are changing their routes, existing probability of being heading towards Romania," explained the head of Hungarian diplomat.
"The guard should start from the border point between Hungary/Serbia/Romania and continue on a reasonable distance if the pressure of migration is moving towards Romania," Szijjarto explained.
At the end of August, the press reported that extra-Community migrants crossing the Serbian territory on their way to the European Union were trying to break the wall built by the Hungarian authorities through its summer capital at the common border between Serbia, Hungary and Romania.
In this context, extra-Community immigrants have discovered that they can break the wall through the area of the Majdan/Rade (Serbia) - Beba Veche (Timis, Romania) - Kubekhaza, Hungary.
The Hungarian Government has allocated 22.2 billion dollars (EUR 71.8 million) for the construction of a controversial metal guard at Serbia's border, at a distance of 175 km, and for special centres needing immigrant housing.
The guard initiative is criticised by the European Union and Serbia.
No need. He'll get there.
The writing with Cornelius Vadim Tudor's unintended body will not be deposited in the Roman Senate, in spite of the wish in this sense expressed by the vadva of the politician.
According to a communiqué remiss Ziare.com, the Permanent Bureau of the Senate held a discussion on March, at the request of Mr Vadim Tudor, on the approval of the deposition of the former Senator Cornelius Vadim Tudor in the seat of the Senate.
"From the receipt of these letters until the moment of the analysis, in the Permanent Bureau, the unspoiled body has already been placed in a cult pool and will hang there, the Permanent Bureau appreciates that it no longer needs to be moved from there to the Roman Senate," the Senate transmits.
Senator PNL Theodor Atanasius argued that this request "is not in line with Romania's geographical position somewhere in Europe".
Also, via Agerpres, the senators held a gathering moment in the memory of former PRM leader, at the suggestion of Senator UNPR Serb Mihailescu.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor died, Monday evening, about 18:30 p.m.
The president of the PRM went on course to the Army Cardiovascular Disease Emergency Clinic.
The European Parliament will be embroiled today from 12:00 at the Ghenzia summit, and will be part of military honours.
Are the refugees coming to Romania?
First of the border premises, questions about the accommodation
The first of the border premises in the Arad case are questioned by the Police and the Frontier Police in these days about the places of residence for any refugees who might arrive in Romania, but also for the yards where they will be mobilized at the border.
The Elder of Nadlac, Vasile Ciceac, said he had discussions on this subject.
The discussions were held including farmers in the area, who were asked to report on the presence of any foreign in the vicinity of the border.
We had discussions with border police, national police and local police, but also with farmers in the area.
We all need to be more vigilant in the next period.
"I asked farmers, who have worked in this period on Arab territory, to be careful and report any movement," said the action.
The crisis of immigrants in Hungary in the hour: Blinded and tapping water to granite
This, like other primarys in the border area with Hungary, said the police requested information on the accommodation available in the case of a refugee valley.
We were asked how many people we can hunt.
We don't have room for refugees in the community.
We believe that such special centres don't even have to appear at the border, because they're harder to control here, migrants are trying to escape, because they're not interested in their shoulder in Romania.
The best thing to do would be to find such centres in areas far away from the border," said the chief of the Iratosu municipality, Pope Atila Josif.
At the end or, the mayor of the municipality of Dorobanti, Vincent Almasi, said that he had been questioned both about shelters for refugees and for intervention forces, if they were mobilized in the area.
The police were interested if we could hunt and hunt.
We could find places on the Cultural Road, but we don't have any room for refugees.
"We have been asked about the length of the border with Hungary, probably working on an action plan," said Vincent Almasi.
He added that at the local police station, "from March to March, when Hungary signed its border with Serbia, it was established permanently".
"There's always a post politician, and the locals know that they have to report if they notice any stranger in the area," said the action.
The First Pilu representatives said that I can catch as many as a hundred people on the Cultural Road, the information being provided by the politicians, at their request.
Also, the capital of the Kurtici city, Nicolae Aanitei, said there are housing spaces in the former local public finance office, where there are need for threat.
Also, an old border police barracks could be threatened with refugee bosses.
The representatives of the Jewish Police Press Office of Arad have not provided a point of view on the issue of primers during this period, confirming that "in the border areas of Arad, patrol activities have been intensified".
Commander of the Army Club announced radical sizes against Becali's Stela
Commander of the Army Sports Club, Colonel George Boroi, announces a series of radical sizes that will be taken against the Star of Gigi Becali.
Although the two parties have negotiated a package, Boroi claims that the Army will have its own football team, which will take the historic palm of the "Ros-Albastres".
The team that won the Cup of Championships is on break from now on.
"It's not a historical break, it's just a competitive break, because we don't have the team, but things can change from next year," said Boroi at Sport.ro.
At the same time, he announces that the process by which he seeks damage from Becali's team will continue.
The period during which we refer to the ICCJ decision is clearly established.
We need to recover the damage from the FC Steaua, the team that used the Steaua brand without the owner's consent - namely CSA Steaua.
It seems very clear and the continuity of the section, which was actually permanent of the Army club.
"So the Steaua Bucuresti football team, in one form or another, but in another legal form, must be as a continuation of the performanceists who have so far in palmares," says George Boroi.
Becali's star and the Army Club are in the open war since the end of last year, when the Supreme Court decided that the soldiers are those who hold the mark "Steaua".

The region where millions are "colcaie"
Millions of Asia-Pacific people will form, this year, the largest group of people in the world, thanks to the news collected in China and India, a published study published Wednesdays by Capgemini and RBC Health Management.
According to this document, in 2015, the accumulated assets of millions of Asian Pacific will exceed the total $15,800 billion registered in 2014, as well as the share of the millions in North America, currently representing the world's richest people, with a total of $16,200 billion, transmitted to the AFP.
The study explains that the Asia Pacific region already has the largest number of very rich people, named in the financial jargon High Net Worth Individuals, HNWI, with 4.69 million such individuals in 2014, compared to 4.68 million in North America.
HNWI are people who can invest at least a million dollars, regardless of the value of property and other property.
"In the future, HNWI's wealth is expected to grow more in Asia Pacific than in any other region of the world, most of the new ones will have to come from the emerging economies of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand," appears in the study carried out by Capgemini and RBC Health Management.
The report estimates that China and India represent nearly 10% of HNWI's global assets and are responsible for 17% of the global growth of new ones after 2006.
China, the world's second economy after the United States, had a total of 990,000 million dollars in 2014 with a total of 4,500 billion dollars in growth of 17,5%, 19.3%, compared with 2013.
On the other hand, India has the fastest rate of growth in the number of millions, 26.3%, up to 198 000 people, while their cumulative population has increased by 28.2%, up to 785 billion dollars.
"Dorel" has mounted the reverse semi-transparent
In Suceava, the workers mounted a semi-trailer down, so instead of being urged to wait for 4 seconds, the passers receive the message "h", which they can't decrypt.
It doesn't matter, whatever the world goes through the red, reports the Truevar.
Every time he cuts his head.
Two boys were to be taken up on a car because they went through the red.
"Politics from Rutiera should be here to help, until the world gets used to it," said a woman for the source quoted.
The Semafor was recently mounted on the front of the Rock Mary of the center of Suceva, but the passers do not seem to take into account him, as much as the information received seemed to be intelligible.
After 6 comes 8, followed by an L, instead of 9-8-7 series.
If "Dorel" did the job right and found someone responsible enough to take over for the job completion, then it would never have happened in this absurd situation.
The Head of the Road Administration and Systematization Service of First Suceava recognized that it was the girl when the semi-trailer began to work, but did not realize that something was wrong.
We gave them in use, but we didn't realize it was a mistake.
"I was actually the girl when they were put into service," said Stefan Vasincu, promising that the problem would be solved in the shortest time.
Praise the Lord that it may be repaired, for there are situations where "Dorel" has made the miner repair.
For example, when he worked at Gürgiu-Russe gas pipeline, "Dorel" ratted out the noise from the tunnel below Dunare, it doesn't know where, probably under the tree, the invasive, it wasn't found, after the very support of the Minister of Economy, Mihai Tudose.
The police put the tunnels with water on immigrants
Hungary's main border with Serbia's Hungarian border has used winters, water tunnels and lacrimogen gases against immigrants.
Although Hungary has closed the border with a ghimpated bear guard and has introduced heavy measures against illegal immigrants, including the arrest, at the sarbo-ungara border, refugees have continued to be gathered, writes The Guardian.
Water tunnels were put into operation when the immigrants succeeded in patrolling through the ghimpa forest by crossing the border from Roszke.
The Hungarian police claim that the action of the tunnels was a measure of control of the crowd, which throws out water bottles.
There are no reports of any injuries, and some people have complained after the use of lacrimogen gases.
Elena Enikos writes, at the same time, that two German companies refuse to deliver as a gift to Hungary.
Tara has already raised her guard at the border with Serbia and March and announced her intention to raise one and at the border with Romania, a strong initiative criticised at Bucharest.
German companies claim that the ghimpat bear is very dangerous and causes infections.
It is used to secure military lockers or facilities, which should not be used against people looking for suitable support.
In parallel to the Hungarian border confrontations, Croatia has been mobilized to make available to bus immigrants to transport those who are present at the border with Serbia.
The Croatian Ministry of Interior confirmed that buses were sent to the border to lead immigrants to the reception centres.
373 people entered Croatia within Serbia, of which 73 children were shown by the Ministry.
Tsipras, on the Greek drama - why is it in agreement with the third agreement with the EU
The stated purpose of former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save her from further austerity and to change her relationship to EU leadership from Brussels.
As a result, the Syrian leader from Greece made part of a third-party improvisation agreement for this country, which also involves more years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, which holds an interview with it.
Now, of course, Tsipras asks the Greeks to deny their prime minister's mandate again, in the context of the elections he claims they will take their political position.
Our aim was to get an agreement, not an exit from the euro area or the demilitarisation of the euro area.
"Now, for the first time, it opens up the possibility of restructuring the debt for Greece," said former prime minister Ellen.
Now, we have an agreement that can be described as a strict one.
"But we knew from the outset that any compromise would have been concluded in the form of an agreement," Tsipras added.
This is of the opinion that the financing part of the agreement is a great success for the elite government, showing that all the financial needs of land are covered by 2019.
"Alexis Tsipras further says that Greece "will certainly need reform," stating that it must begin with state reform.
Tsipras announced his resignation on 27 August, thus opening the way for early elections, in September, after 7 February in front of the Athenian Executive, during which one of Greece's third rescue empire was approved.
He was chosen with broken cat and grades one after he exploded into the electronic tiger

Star Trek's act, in prison for breaking up in front of children.
Attrita Jennifer Lien, known as Star Trek, where she played for three seasons, intruding on Kes, was arrested for inappropriate exposure to children.
The incident that took her to prison, where she was found on September 3rd -- the prison fixed at $2,500 -- took place in front of her house in Tennessee.
The sight began to check with a neighbor, Carey Smith, because of one of his children who was crying, reported Mirror.
At a given moment, during the debate, the actress raised her shirt, showing her bust, so that then, before entering the house, she lay down and her pants.
When the police came, Jennifer refused to get involved.
Moreover, it threatened to kill the politicians and was forced into the car.
It's not the first time the 41-year-old actress has problems with the police; in April, it was also arrested, then committed including assault.
Jennifer entered Kes's skin in 1995, after she appeared in "American History X", a film in which he also played Edward Norton.
He quit acting in 2002, when his first child was born.
She's married to the writer and film producer Phil Hwang.
I've been taken in view of the Western Mithral.
You don't support terrorism anymore!
Syrian President Bashar of Assad has given a rare interview to the Russian press, where he talks about refugees and accuses the West of supporting terrorists and of "visiting" immigrants.
"The West weeps for them and the West supports terrorists from the beginning of the crisis, when he said this is a passive revolution," Assad said, in an interview agreed by Russia Today.
The leader of Damascus claims that his Western counterparts say about the situation in Syria as well as the Islamic State, "but because of the Syrian state or the Syrian regime or the Syrian president".
As long as this propaganda follows, there will be more refugees.
So it's not about the fact that Europe didn't accept it or that it didn't immigrate it as refugees, it's about not dealing with the cause.
If you're angry with them, you don't support terrorists anymore.
That's what we believe about the crisis.
"This is the core of all refugee matters," adds the Syrian leader.
Assad continued the charges against the Western States and with regard to the treatment they showed the refugee girl.
It is as if the West is now crying for refugees with one eye and takes into account the munitions with the second eye, because those refugees have actually stopped Syria because of terrorism, in principle because of terrorists and crime and in the second round because of the results of terrorism.
"When you have terrorism and destruction of infrastructure, you will not have the resources of basic life, so many people leave because of terrorism and because they will be punished somewhere in this world," Bashar of Assad says.
"If we asked any Syrian today what he wanted, the first thing he would say would be 'We want security and security for every person and every family'," stressed the Syrian president, adding that political forces, whether inside or outside the government, "should be united in what the Syrian people want."
The Syrian President is of the opinion that the dialogue in his country should continue "to achieve consensus", which cannot be implemented "as long as we break terrorism in Syria".
"I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to ask all the forces to join themselves against terrorism, because it is the way we can achieve the political objectives that we as Syrians want through dialogue and political action," Bashar of Assad said.
It also spoke of one of its allies, Russian President Vladimir Putin, arguing that, in the context of the crisis in Ukraine, it was transformed from a friend of the West into its enemy.
Bashar of Assad compared the situation in Syria to that of Russia, accusing the West of falsifying reality in both cases.
Note what happened in the western press after the hit in Ukraine.
What happened?
President Putin has been transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy and has been described as a tartar.
He is portrayed as a dictator who has removed the opposition from Russia and has gained power through non-democratic means, despite the fact that he has been elected in democratic elections, and the West itself has recognized that the elections have been democratic.
Now, they're not democratic anymore.
"This is Western propaganda," said the leader of Damascus.
Not recently, it included Russia on the list of friends - and regional partners - with which Syria is ready to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, Iran and Iraq 'because it faces the same type of terrorism'.
Instead, Bashar of Assad criticised Turkey, another neighbor, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who said "I can't even make a move without coordination with the United States and other Western countries".
In addition, the President of Syria accuses "international coalition", led by the United States, which is fighting terrorism: "In fact, since this coalition has begun to operate, the Islamic State has begun to expand."
In other words, the quality has gone out and has no impact on the ground.
At the same time, countries such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Western lands that provide coverage for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight terrorism.
You can't be with terrorism at the same time.
"But if these states decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in your pocket, it will stop you - then we have no intention of cooperating with all these states, considering that it is a real and not false coalition to fight terrorism," said the leader from Damascus.
Tomasna?
Not a word.

The weather will be quite hot in the winter, especially in the west, where temperatures will go from 30 degrees to 30 degrees.
In Bucharest, 26 degrees will be registered at noon.
They'll be on the literal with the second degree less, while all 26 degrees are announced on the mountain in Brasov.
They will be 21 degrees to Moeceu, 23 to Bran, 23 to Paraul Rece, 20 to Predeal and 20 to Busteni.
We want something warmer to be in the east of the lake, where the milk from the thermometer will go through 30 degrees.
31 degrees to Satu Mare, 29 to Zalau, 30 to Cluj Napoca, 31 to Oradea, 28 to Alba Iulia, 30 to Arad, Timisoara and Caransebes.
The sky will be old and in the east, where meteorologists announce 27 degrees to Botosani, 25 to Suceava, 23 to Piatra Neamt, 26 to Iasi, Vaslui and Bakau, 25 to Focsani and 26 to Galati.
In the rest of the Tuesday it is announced 30 degrees to Targu Mures, 28 to Sibiu, 26 to Ramnicu Valcea, 25 to Pitesti, Targoviste and Ploisti, 26 to Braila, 25 to Tulcea, 26 to Slobozia, 27 to Calarasi and Giurgiu, 26 to Slatina and 28 to the Severin Tower.
The map of the tarot cards with the biggest fruit and how Romania is
Breaking the oil share has caused large losses in the last year of workers in the extraction of title, energy companies' shareholders and tariffs which are very much dependent on this resource.
There is also a positive effect: gasoline has had a huge effect.
A combined paper from Bloomberg shows that, in the period October 2014 - July 2015, almost all 76 tar taken into account, the fuel price dropped.
The most important reduction in the price at the pump is observed in Venezuela.
In this country, the engine got 97%, so you can feed 24 U.S. U.S. dollars less than a dollar.
On the opposite side is Saudi Arabia, where the price is fixed by four states.
The cost of the engine varies from country to country, depending on the refining conditions, changes in taxation, but also fluctuations in the exchange rate.
For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg turned the average price from each state into US dollars.
The situation in Romania
The Bloomberg data show that, in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a petrol gallon (about 3.8 litres) was $5.49.
So we're at the 27th in the range of tar with the most expensive fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this position in the top.
The last quarter of 2014, the gas was also fed to the Romans.
Then, the average price of a gallon was $6.14, which means a 10.6% price reduction.
However, the streets around them are better.
In Bulgaria, a gallon of gasoline costs $4.92 and in Hungary - $5.20.
The Germans set their way to the fate of immigrants in the middle of the night: What Merkel promised
German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised last night that the federal government would provide additional support to the 16 countries of the federation to receive and distribute tens of thousands of migrants entering the country south of Europe.
After a four-hour meeting with the prime ministers of the 16 federal states, Merkel stated that "the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to make the big number of refugees," says DPA agency.
It added that the federal government will create 40,000 sites for initial arrivals, as well as distribution centres.
"I need such pivot points," she stressed.
All of you have to provide a massive push to make the face of the crisis, added Merkel.
The country's premiums have requested more than the 6 billion euros agreed by the federal government coalition after more than a week.
Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow of the Stanga Party asked for "the least double and for commitments to be accelerated", in comments to a local newspaper.
On the run or, the prime minister of Renania-Palatinate, Malu Dreyer, insisted that migrants be quickly integrated into German society.
"We need a national pact between all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also business, trade unions and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also asked that the bureaucracy in the handling of refugees and migrants be accelerated.
She noted that Elvetia completed the proceedings in 48 hours and in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
The Prime Minister of Bavaria Horst Seehofer expressed similar feelings.
So far, Bavaria has the worst poverty ever, with the most migrants arriving after crossing the border with Austria.
Seehofer, a powerful federal actor as head of the Crestin-Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, entered into a public conflict with Merkel after the Chancellor announced a virtual policy of use opened at the beginning of the month, recalls DPA.
Mircea Lucescu scans after the humiliating infraction with Real Madrid
The Lucescu Mircea was a nerve car at the end of the game with Real Madrid, which Sahtior Donetk lost with 0-4.
The Roman coach showed himself totally barbarous, saying that Sahttier lost his intruder was disappointed.
Before the game, I said one thing, so I want to be respected.
In peace, we are always disappointed by arbitration in the encounters with important European teams.
There are two totally different ways.
The new one agrees with a Galben cardon immediately, while the top teams don't.
In addition, the first penalty wasn't in any case!
Mingea hit Darijo back without touching his hand.
A level game such as this should not be influenced by arbitration.
"I'm afraid the referee has broken the game," said Mircea Lucescu at the press conference.
"Mister, but what's so awful here?"
They were eating from the broken husband.
A crime of a sadism out of common has threatened the inhabitants of Tsargu Frumos and Roman.
Yesterday morning, at the first hour of the day, the marketers from Târgu Frumos could see terrible scenes near the main market entrance.
In addition to the three tomberoones, the criminals "assembled" what seemed to be the body of a man.
This was broken, but their head, internal organs and genitals were missing.
Finally, it was to prove that it was a former officer's body, who had been betrayed by his wife, professor of geography.
"The Fire of Iaşi" spoke to the dealer even with the taximeter who helped the criminal, without knowing, at the box of sacrilege with the dead body.
Her stories make your hair soft.
The one who warned the police yesterday about the fact that a woman who had three bags that were threatening, after eating from her body was found on the market, was a taximeterist from Tjrgu Frumos.
As in American films, the man helped himself carry bags full of human food that smelled hard, but without knowing, the crime was a client for a course.
The taximeter told, except for "The Fire of Iaşi", the shocking scenes he went through, helping no one want a killer to hide the evidence.
This was done with the hands of the sacrilege where the body parts of the professor's husband of geography were found, which he had crossed.
She came to Tsargu Frumos to hide the evidence of the crime as far away from her home in Rome.
Maybe he's got mine.
I didn't know where you were from.
Nea Mihai, as he is known by his friends who practice taximetry in Tjrgu Frumos, came to see him at night in the small town where he lives.
This has seen American films throughout his life, but he never thought he would ever dare be the one who would be on the basis of finding a sad crime, and he would see with his eyes eating bodies.
This tells us that, on the night of the month to March, it is usually expected that cars will arrive regularly passing the premises.
This is close to intersecting roads to Rome and the Pacific.
The taximeter reports that the killer woman observed it in the retrovisive mirror, along with the bags with the body parts supported by the indicator showing the nearest locations.
She came in the night with the Massaro race from 1.30.
The car left it ten metres from the passage of pedestrians in the Pascani, right on the bridge where it shows the mileage.
The bags were carded with the indicator.
After she left the car, I put her in a ten-metre marcher.
I opened my wallet and, after I put a bag, I asked, "Sir, what's so horrible here?"
I saw she's an old woman, and I told her to help.
I thought he was taking meat to the market, maybe he had mine, I didn't know where to find it.
I thought he might want to kick somebody with that stinking meat.
She tried to raise a single bag, and I hesitated to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was tied.
"He specified that I should go to the big gate of the street, when I took her out of the car," he began to tell Mihai.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He completed that the woman didn't say anything at all, and, as a result, he wasn't even curious to ask her anything.
Until I got there, I didn't say anything because I was nervous about putting my ass in my car.
And when he put the bags down from the car, I noticed that smells and smells worse.
She put the bag down.
When I got back in the car, I put two meters behind me to get back, and I realized I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
I left my wallet open and moved the car back and forth, so that the smell could disappear.
I didn't notice if someone helped me dig the bag because I had lights in the back and I didn't see it in the glasses.
"There were two plastic bags and one rifle," completed the man.
Seeing the woman's strange behavior, she says she's starting to make curiosity.
In my mind, I realized something was wrong.
After giving her the bag down, I went to the hospital, to the Prime Minister, and when I came back, I forgot to see what the woman was doing with the bag.
It crossed between the bag after guard, where are the drummers inside the market.
Then I left again.
It was a little bit of aggressive, because there was an Italian microbus and a car.
I saw how the woman went to their shoes to get into them, to shoot them, but probably the shoes didn't want to take it, because they have international courses, and I don't take occasions.
The woman was very upset, she's walking back and forth.
At a certain point, the woman entered Peco and, curiously, I asked an employee outside what she had done inside.
The manager answered that he went and washed his hands.
Then I asked him where she was from because I saw her later.
I looked for him and found him coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and I told them there was something suspicious.
"Then I went somewhere else, a race to the Belcešti," completed Mihai.
He told us that the woman had become upset after she left the bag at the graveyard.
To me, the suspicion went away from the fact that the bag disappeared, and I was curious what it did with him.
When the cops went to her, they asked her what she was doing there and they showed her to me, telling her I noticed that she had a suspicious bag.
Then the woman went to the tomb and showed them the bag.
"I went back to the place where he hid the bag around 3:00 when I gave the statements to the police and prosecutors from the place," and ended the taximeter report.
The prosecutors of Neamz, who investigate the case, say that the 64-year-old professor, Ana Zaharia, was surprised by the rooms to receive views of a Roman gas station at 0.55 hours, starting with the three bags in the car.
She arrived at Tsargu Floros at 1.30 p.m.
According to the investigators, she would have killed her husband, who had been married for four years, with a knife, then broke her home.
The man was named Gheorghe Zaharia, and he was an officer in the reserve.
On Sunday night, the woman put her bodies in two plastic bags, which she carried to her car, and hid them.
Last night, he transported another one, then he decided to go in direction, and chose the Bucharest car - Iasii.
Last night, the prosecutors still didn't know where the woman hid her husband's internal organs, and neither the genitals.
But the head was found in newspapers and pungies, in a detachment from the woman's apartment.
She was retired, as was her husband.
By evening, the prosecutors did not find out from the woman who was the reason she killed her husband with such cold blood and sadism.
The most likely, the professor will be mentally experienced and the body will be examined by legal doctors to determine officially the cause of death and any other relevant details.
The first took national roads across the municipality, after years of being taken by the Government, in order to be asphalted with money from the national budget in the 2004 electoral campaign.
The decision was adopted yesterday by the Local Council (CL), and in order to be applied, a decision of the Government must be taken.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the Regional Directorate for National Roads was a matter of fact because it was able to reach the opinion of the General Banking Plan (PUG).
The first took a network of 11 kms.
In any case, a legislative amendment which was adopted in July 2015 forced the municipality to adopt national roads that pass through the municipality.
No opinion can be delivered from the National Roads unless the law is respected, so that we have to approve this.
National roads have been in our administration since today.
"Of course, the government decision will also have to be issued as a result of this decision of the Local Council," Interim Prime Minister Mihai Chirica said.
The national roads that surround the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
The 28th National Road beats Yašul on the streets: the Pácurari, the mountain road (to be larger), the Moara de Fire, the Silvestr strike, the Silvestr road, bd. Nicolae Iorga, bd. The Prime Minister, the Chišinăi Road, the village husband until he leaves the municipality to Tomesti - Albitia.
The other national road, DN 24, covers the six Bucium, Bd. Socola (up to Semafor), Bucium road (up to Baza 3), Chišinau Road, Bd. Tudor Vladimirescu, Bd. C.A. Rosetti and exit to Cárlig-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
In continuing to describe files from "the path" of the political sympathy of Mircea Eliade's youth who, although convicted, would have shown too much the size of a daily article and should be circulated in series, worthy, I believe, evocated friendship between Council Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most viciously charged rapists used by the Roman wise dictators.
A less humorous description would be, I hope, useful in the real debate that has recently been called "anti-legionary", it would be appropriate to strike it out in the Romanian intellectual environment.
Analysing the various versions of Eliade's indigestion in the League through the "Axa" Cup and the "Gyr" Council, Florin zurkanu brings into discussion, in the volume Mircea Eliade.
The prison of history (Bucurešti, 2003), another hypothesis, which is of interest to us at the highest degree in understanding the resumption of epistolic contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after Ceaušescu played the "Balcony scene" in August of that year.
Based on the documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure during the security investigation, in 1941, documents stored today in the SRI archive (FD, File 573, f.15) as well as on a 1938 follow-up note, Florin zurkanu says that "Eliade will not enter their group, but in this way he says "Legionary family" called Luminzia, a group of "cubi" intellectuals, especially writers, led by the poet Radu Gyr".
As there is no verifiable data on the Luminance cave, those outside the building considering the existence of this discussed "legionary family", what should be discussed is, until the context in which this information has been recorded in the file.
Allowing to a surprise part of the SRI's ability to make these secret files available to Mr. Urcano, it is more than clear that at that time the security detention was "the Commander" of Radu Gyr, Eliade's reference was made, in the context of the March 21, 1938, in which Armand Călinescu, the Minister of the Interior took the initiative to take all the necessary measures so that King Carol could impose his royal decree, suspending Parliamentary life and eliminating the main political force of the legionaries who began to enjoy an unexpected popularity (the Allies of the Three-thirds Powers) (the All of the Three-Years Party).
Eliade's arrest was carried out as a result of this note, quoted by the Uurcano: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, founded in the Legal Movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under the leadership of Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr".
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as a supporting bureaucratic coverage for the repression in 1938 and it is likely that such superficial notes would be made at the table for the majority of the legionists or activists active in public space who had to be arrested but who had to be bound by an important legion leader.
The olographic statement of Radu Gyr mentioned above, given in the arrest in February 1941, after the legional rebellion was over, only to confirm it retrospectively at first, the banal method of bureaucratic coverage in any police regime, authoritarian.
It would be interesting if the hurricane had provided more details about the content of the 573 files read.
Was it the exact file of Elijah or Radu Gyr?
Because it must be a file built on the basis of security documents, but then worked for Security to be used or against one another.
There is an error here, as well as in the use of the term "member" of the Movement, which only someone knows the creation of the internal structures of this radical organization based on a religious foundation knows that it represents a premier stage, of course, in which the person concerned acts as an active sympathizer, located in the three-year period before he becomes a "friend" with regular acts.
Also, all these forms of secondary organization such as intellectual clubs or workshops, sitters, discussion groups with countries, youth organisations or students who were pregnant around a cave were his "family", they were not his "family", they were not his own "house", as a form of political and action organisation.
This kind of tone completely escapes the unsuspecting reader by making Eliade's "member" status (which may be plausible) understood and used to write to designate political interference in chaos.
Of course, the call for subtilities for this kind of interpretation cannot hide the public support activities of the Gárzii and no clear sympathy for the Captain who encouraged Eliade in the period 1935-1940, whether or not in Nae Ionescu's village.
Public support for a cause in which you believe does not mean, however, as necessary, and political restraint itself says so much more than that, on a regular basis, intellectuals of this kind retain a kind of superiority over activities as well as enter into politics than when they are directly offered high-priority.
As long as I was able to form an opinion about Eliade's kind of thinking from that period, where he was "the leader of the younger generation," I find it hard to believe that he would have accepted the hierarchical rules of a bunch of legionaries.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual climb, however!
To say no more than in the past, the fact that, in any legitimate "file", what is first is anti-Semitated public activity as well as violence, both deserve to be stigmatized, but not existing in Eliade's case, until we are tested.
With regard to Eliade-Gyr's correspondence from 1968 - 1969, Mircea Handoca, a defense activist of Eliade, tries to penalize Florin's claims (but based on some archive documents, even though it is worth more dissociating and contextualizing) with an argument yet to be discussed.
The Handoca Mircea notes, in the volume We voted on Mircea Eliade (București, 2006), that "no line of correspondence between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr does not contain any objections to this framework".
It was not like in 1968, when, when, somehow out of the communists, Radu Gyr could not have been at risk of any illusion in a letter that obviously was intercepted by censorship.
What I think he wanted to highlight Mircea Handoca is the fact that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was a respectable, admiration and affection without any doubt about Elijah's ascension.
There's really no such thing as even the worst idea that Radu Gyr would ever be Eliade's boss.
Intelligently, the poet is obliged to write on Patri’s Glass, he is driven from the head of the standing position by signaling to Eliade (who knew very exactly what the mission had been doing with the constant denouncing of the right exile), in the signature, after "your old friend" what to expect and is apparently easy and happy when it responds positively after almost three decades of separation since "the time" has come to her.
There is no doubt about the fact that, apart from the "mission" with which it was loaded (to convince Eliade that now in New Romania, he could come back at least to see his mother and friends) and that, by means of short proposals, apart from paragraphs, to suggest their character as a stranger, Radu Gyr shows his interest only for literature.
It does not speak of esoteric austions, recommended political complications or any mention of youth age in a register other than the cultural one.
It is difficult to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior to Eliade's legal line, but until this version was consolidated with less circumstantial evidence than those offered by Florin zurkanu, we have in this correspondive memory cells that witness a mutual appreciation of different but stately, our culture and which, in addition to all the trials of life, restore the tone of civilisation and inter-ethnic education.
Important human and cultural documents and why not?, accompanying for the strength of friendship and respect one another beyond the "under time" destination of authors.
At the beginning of the 1970s, Eliade finally gave up on the status of refugee receiving American citizenship and, under the pretext offered by health problems and floods in the country, announced to the RSR authorities, through the embassy (with which he carried a shady correspondence used to obtain passports for his sister), that he could not extend the invitation to return to the country.
The following was predictable: it's back to the index, it's "toladot business" in Israel, the letters sent to families and friends (Fragments of a newspaper, Gallimard, 1973) are blocked by censorship, and she never sees her mother again.
Among the country's friends, only Noica has more sporadic correspondence, although, surprisingly, as a witness personal archive from Chicago, many individuals or Romanian institutions are more able to send messages to her.
It's clear why Radu Gyr no longer received permission to write it after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Ceauşescu regime tried to convince Eliade (by official invitations, Noica's demerits, translations etc.) Radu Gyr has already been transferred to the neighborhood.
New coach, foreign player
Because of the pendulum of the autobibalists, Penicilina Iași is tested in sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
Exhibits participating in the training tournament under the command of trainer Dan Gavril
Retrograded in the first half of the year from Division A1 of women's volleyballs, Penicilina Iași has kept the place in the first stage due to the retreat and then the development of the Miroslava Science formation, soon promoted in the first stage following an even-exclusive bari race.
The news took little to the unpretentious conduct of the outside group, which woke up without main coach (after the departure of Rareș Puni, arrived second to the Bacau Science) and many missing players, some retired such as Cristina Lungu and liberal Diana Studineanu, or departed, as Ana-Maria Berdilă (at the Alba Blī Volilei) and the sisters Maria and Juliana Fica.
Fires, until the reopening of the championship scheduled on October 10, there was and there was more time to complete the harvest.
A new trainer was first found in Dan Gavril's personality, from the LPS Male Team Piatra Neamz who worked less in the last few years in Penicillina, which was able to sign a contract with the team led by Vasile Stäng.
Then two players from the Miroslava Science, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconică were brought, being tried and several foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland, almost transferred by Serbian player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and Montenegrin Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of the month, the Penicilinei castle led by Dan Gavril performed a canton at Gura Humori, after which he participated in a tournament held at Lugoj and equipped with Cupa Banatulu, in which the outputs won a victory (3-0 with Cluj University), but also suffered two episodes, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMU Craiova.
The next week, on 23-25 September, Penicillina will participate in another tournament in Craiova.
For the new champion we're trying to build a valuable team.
We have a trained and experienced trainer, but Romania's player fund is quite low and therefore we will call on volunteers from abroad, especially after it has been decided that teams can use an unlimited number of players outside the country.
This decision will affect the young generation of sports from Romania's clubs.
"We hope to reach the end of the competitive year at 5-6 places, even if it will be very difficult" said Vasile Stángá, President ACS Penicilina Iași.
It's an emotional meeting.
People gathered after nearly 70 years
The people George Krzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, 69 years old, were born at the end of World War II in Germany after their mother of Polish origin had just been released from a labor camp.
Because she was too sick to care for them, the people were sent to Poland to adoption, the two brothers being so separated not only from what gave them life, but also from one another.
Ten years George and Lucian didn't know one about the other.
At the age of 17, George discovered documents proving that he was adopted and that he had a brother.
In the 1960s, she asked Red Cross to help her find her brother, but they didn't find any clue that would lead her to Lucian.
Soon in 2015, thanks to the program, "Restoring Family Links" of the Red Cross, the people met again, and the moment was more than exciting.
The BBC reporters have surprised this episode.
Ten children from Iaşi brought home from Stuttgart four medals to sport dance
Two gold medals, a silver medal and a bronze medal were won by children from Germany Open Championship from Stuttgart, an international dance competition organised by the German Dances Sports Federation and the World Dances Sports Federation.
From Iaşi they participated in five couples who were trained at the Dance Energy Club and who danced along with 9,000 sportsmen from 20 countries.
The 10 children out of the group participated in five different categories (youths 1, young people, young people, young people, young people, and amateurs).
Those who returned home with the medals were: Răzvan Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Târzianu (two medals of gold and one silver), Vlad Constantin Donosa and Otilia Čtefana Gologan (Bronz medal).
And the other three couples managed to take over the front seats: Bogdan Stelian Duminica and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad Ene and Antonia Ioana Iosub Cujbă and not the last part of Andrei Emilia and Raluca Elena Ionica.
As a coach I wanted to confirm the results achieved in March of this year, this confirmation is necessary for both us and sportsmen as regards their future evolution.
The fact that we were able to hear Romania's fame twice this year at German Open and to return home with four medals makes us very happy and gives us hope and confidence that we can raise both the club and its sportsmen to an even higher level.
"All of this would be possible only with some important elements: involvement, respect, trust and a lot of work," said Andrea Ramona Manolache, coach of children at the Dance Energy Club.
Romania has been represented this year by 34 country clubs, which has a total of 9 medals, thus qualifying our country to place 4 in the 20 participating countries.
Of the new medals, four came to Iaşi.
6 method of escape of stress in a minute
Too few of us allow us to run a week on the mountain to escape stress.
Some hold our time, others our finances, and both our obstacles.
There are solutions to anyone who wants to escape some stress.
This does not involve any higher costs and no special time allocated, according to lyla.ro.
Day care is inevitable, but it depends on us how we do it and how we treat it.
Instead of driving inside and feeling like an impossion has a place in your mind, you better try the following relaxation tactics that don't take you for more than a minute.
Breathe in progress
Respiratory exercises are not intended only for yoga soloists or practitioners.
They work for every person in part, and regulating breathing at a tense moment helps release endorphine into the body, a process that leads to a resting-place, reports Livestrong.
Children
We know we've gone beyond the age of childhood, and we're not allowed to step away when we have our boss.
But that doesn't mean we can't go into a desk seat corner or we know we're alone (even behind the roof) and don't type as much as we have the flames.
You can escape nerves and negative energy accumulated during a day with a few healthy crops.
Imagine a beautiful place
We know that the recommendation calls for a replication during a psychotherapy session, but it didn't stop psychologists from using it.
Imagine a beautiful place that inspires us with calmness and quietness of day-to-day frenzy can lead to the slowing of the old nerves.
It is, in fact, self-suggestion, a procedure that can even change lives, both in good health and in bad.
Everything depends on what we're suggesting.
The best thing is to think about an idyllic place where our soul is infuriating us.
Listen to music
Brace your ears and listen to relax music.
Attention, it's not the word of favorite music, because if it's the word of heavy metal it could be pushed heavily into rest.
Listen even relaxful songs, which are line and not verses, to rule the balance at the time when you opened your bottle.
Decoding protocol
Does it sound strange the advice of decomposing a portal into the nerves?
Well, it's not!
Because it's not the fruit word in itself, because it doesn't contain a miraculous substance or Xanax to connect us completely (occasional, too).
It's about aroma therapy!
The smell of orange coji during decoy stimulates the brain to produce endorphine, hormone of good old age.
Mangaie and an animal
Those who have near animals, whether it's the word of the house, or the word of the one who's been here at work, will take a few seconds to walk it.
According to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases, animal manoeuvres can decrease blood pressure.
clock and rock with violet and guitar
Two talented musicians of instruments like rivals, but collaborators in this acoustic project, sing Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous pieces of the Roman folklore combined with guitar.
The acoustic project belongs to Christian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe and is entitled WHEN violin Meets Guitar, writes hotnews.ro.
Florentin: "We found ourselves, and since then it has made us very happy to sing together, having an unlimited practical repertoire."
We thought this was the moment a violet met with a guitar.
Cristi: "From the first interview we realized that what I sang was very good and that, from the point of view of the human component, things work."
Each of us has learned from the other repertoire and, what's very important, is that the sounds of the two instruments match.
Florentin: "I know there's a gap between classical music people and the rest."
I think many people can listen to classical music.
And on the second round we stole a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rockers and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the point among the genres, we want to offer a kind of music that could make only those who listen to classical music listen to rock, and those who listen only to rock get to love classical music.
And I was surprised to be told at the end of a concert that they never imagined they'd listen to something like that and they'd like it.
Cristi: "When we find young people -- and find out more -- who I know who Pink Floyd was, it doesn't seem amazing."
The Iaşi students were more trafficked than at school on the first day after vacation
Hundreds of people came out yesterday morning "captives" in hell traffic in more areas.
The first announced that today the Mangeron Boulevard is closed between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roș.
The Heads of First Instance did not respect the promises of carrying out work for the flow of traffic once at the beginning of the school year.
One of the assurances given by the municipality, at least twice in the last week, has been in the re-establishment of the roundup of the International Park area.
Although only a few elements of the provisional were to be mounted, and the last time the work was finished last week, yesterday the rotation was not carried out.
The jury's nerves were pushed to the maximum on Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, bearing in mind that another promise of the First was broken: the shift from Nicolae Iorga to Tehnopolis "after the end of August", in the context of which this transfer is still under discussion since 2012.
Today, Interim Prime Minister Mihai Chirica says the problem of the International Gara is more complex.
The rotation will be made at the appropriate time, we need to take account of the movement of traffic in the area, we need an opinion from the National Roads.
"It's not like in Zimbru, where it's time for the tram to stay in rotation, but we'll sort it out," said Chirica.
One of the solutions, according to this, would be stopping the tramway with a semafor before turning.
Problems in circulation were also in the intersection of the Red Podu.
The car code from the street St. Lazarus was extended to the SRI seat.
"I waited a good minute to get out of Podu Roș," said an outsider.
In September, Podu Roš had to travel to CUG if the project "Supervation and Rehabilitation of Functional Arterial Arterial Rehabilitation" was finalised in the initial implementation (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complete it at the beginning.
"I have drawn European funds for new jobs, for example, overhauling, on the initial variant of Nicole's passport was pleasant," Chirica commented.
The most recent deadline for reintroducing traffic is October.
During yesterday's day, the outsiders reported problems in traffic especially in areas such as Pácurari, Centre (Targu Cucu, Independence, Armenian Street) or the section of Base 3.
Admonition could come back as head of CJ.
You'll know for sure in the morning.
The Court’s judges will decide tomorrow whether the suspended President of the Court of Justice will maintain judicial control and the prohibitions.
The judges of the Iaşi Court decided yesterday a new term in the "Album" file where the accused is also the suspended President of the Iaşi Judezian Council.
At the end of yesterday's sitting, the magistrates decided to speak in the course of the morning on the measure of judicial control currently imposed against Edom.
This lasts in place or revokes this measure, which holds him away from the CJ's headquarters for several months.
In the case of a favourable solution, and if this is to be remembered by the Supreme Court, Christian Admonition will be able to resume its role as President of the CJ.
The household was sent to court by the National Antico Breakdown Directorate (DNA), accused of favouring the manufacturer and intellectual fraud after, I say to the curators, it would have been tried to mask an audit check after which a series of rules on receipt from a public contract signed between CJ and Laser Co were discovered.
The Ombudsman would have tried to hide the fact that the institution which led it would not have received more materials to promote the Iaşi trial, although these materials were Scripturally included as being received by CJ.
In addition, it has been the subject of justice and three directors of the CJ, but also the manager of Laser Co.
Another 3,500 exits are waiting for the vote until 25 September.
The first is ready to distribute further issues if the 12,000 will be exposed.
The outsiders have only ten days to express their opinion on the replanting of the sails on the Great St. Stephen.
According to municipal officials, there have so far been around 8,500 of the 12 000 issues distributed at the centre of the road and in three other additional points of the city (Copou Park, Alexandru delle Good and Primaria Park).
A record number of exits was presented on Sunday before the First.
According to the representatives of the civil group "Loves You" 530 outlets voted in 140 minutes, almost four votes every minute, respectively.
Instead, throughout the month, about 440 people came out in the same place.
The group's volunteers say that many outsiders announce the signalling and the people will be unable to deliver public consultation.
As a result, they have made an appeal yesterday to Internet users to print a display of information made available to the group and put it in block boxes.
The volunteers also showed that the last form was completed by Sunday's exits at the addition point in the Copou Park.
We're going to offer form from the shopping malls, where it's not too complete.
"We will make any additions when all the 12,000 forms will be completed," said municipality spokesman Sebastian Buraga yesterday.
"Scrolls zeros" will be completed on 25 September, and if the majority vote of the exitrs is in favour of the replanting of the children then the Prime Minister will plant its silver in this autumn.
Guests can express their opinion at the centre of the charity in Dacía, Frumoas, Tátárași, Nicolina and Pácurari as well as at the above-mentioned additional points.
The Prime Ministers decided to take over the Čtefan Mare at the beginning of 2013, an action that has brought an amendment to 60,000 municipalities.
The decision was adopted unilaterally, without consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous appearance of the civil group "Loves You", an online community comprising about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, an application initiated by the civil replanting group was signed by over 9,100 supporters until evening.
RECORD of students registered at USAMV Iaşi!
I'm 920 in the year I
The university has 920 students this year in the first year.
The representatives of the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ionescu de la Brad" explained that this year were the most widely accepted candidates ever from the history of the higher education institution since its establishment.
We are very grateful for the results of this year from admission.
We have the largest number of admitted candidates from the history of the university, nearly 920 students in the first year. I've never missed such a number.
"We've also had higher-level candidates, we've been busy with the license and master budget locations," said Prof. Dr. Ioan Ženu, the prosecutor responsible for the educational activity.
This further explained that the university has recorded a considerable number of students at the tax rate, with 20% of the places concerned, a significant figure greater than in other years.
Although the results have also been published on the Romanian-language study lines, the admission continues to the English-language study programme from the University of Veterinary Medicine, which has taken 50 places, where the rate is 5000 euros, and is now expected to be responded by the Minister for the confirmation of the student files and the necessary study views.
At the autumn session, 120 files were placed at the 14 budgeted locations and 209 out of competition under "tax" at the licensing studies.
The most files were sent to the University of Agriculture, 75, Horticulture was 23, and Zootehnie, 22.
At the master's autumn session, 18 files were deposited at the 150 places on the tax proposed by USAMV, seven of them in Agriculture, five in Horticulture and six in Zootehnia.
The drivers are afraid of entering the car wheels on the Tudor Vladimirescu floor
The bridge over the Balhui on the Tudor Vladimirescu Boulevard remained as silent as when "The Fire of Iaşi" wrote about the problems it presents, within 10 days.
Our daily reports then indicated that on the axis that limits the two sense of walking the asphalt was left, some even 20 centimetres away, showing concrete plates representing the primary infrastructure of the floor.
Also, the asphalt began to appear on one side and on the other side of the axis, before the signs that the depth would be accentuated.
At the same time, Interim Prime Minister Mihai Chirica points out that the bridge does not have structural problems, as a technical expertise has recently been made in order to launch a project to rehabilitate the bridge and make it more than EUR 5 million.
The first Chirica explains that the area affected by fissures and groups will be signalled, following rapid recovery of the asphalt.
The only measures taken so far have been the installation of poppies and a signalling van without even making a simple blow.
During this period, we focused more on opening up the school and the necessary things for this purpose.
"It is currently a point of expertise for the post we are waiting for about a week with the necessary details of the intervention, I appreciate that in at least two weeks we could go through the process," said the interim prime minister.
At the beginning of the school year
Yesterday, my eldest son, Stefan, started school.
The preparatory class, as he tries to improve the situation.
I don't know if I'm happy or I'm going to get caught up in melancholy; step aside, passive, to the second variant.
First of all, because I feel like they've only been three weeks, not three years since I first went to college with emotion.
Although it is easy to succeed, not even a normal parent is happy that their children are growing up.
Secondly, because I remember perfectly the same day from my childhood; it started a story that didn't end until today.
I wasn't exactly what's usually called a conscious student.
On the contrary, I'd say.
But I always liked school.
So much so that I've chosen to keep it going, even if it's as a teacher.
When I decided that's what I want to do all my life, I knew it wasn't an easy mission.
And not one with a month at a time.
This is because, like each of us, I have given over the whole class of teachers: better or worse, more sympathetic or inflexible, more equal or less right to imbecile.
It happens, unfortunately, that there are people with other calls in this mess.
I think these are toxic, because it leaves enthusiasm and even the mind of a young person willing to form.
I've been lucky to give, as long as I was a student or a student, over a few, a few, butchers.
These meetings can be decisive if they are held at the right time.
Anyone who believes that the role of the person in the room is a wave of transmission of information is alarming.
This can be done by anyone; of course, the student can be informed very well of one alone, that we are only living in a time of transparency.
But a good teacher models students' minds.
He's training them, he's paving their mind.
Staying in a chair isn't a privilege, as you think it's enough, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very mofty, they are demanding, indifferent and always willing to look for the faults of those around them.
That's how old they are, the temperature.
As a teenager, we all thought we knew everything, that we had certificates of innocence about anything.
When we grow up, we're able to understand that we have only doubts.
Therefore, the role of a teacher is to get him out of his self-sufficient category and make him think.
I mean, he's supposed to doubt, ask himself questions.
Find out for yourself the answers, both them and the provisionals.
Let's get involved in everything that he does.
To direct him discreetly to profitable models.
It's very difficult, especially that most of the times the student thinks the teacher is his enemy.
One who's just waiting to catch his wrong foot to punish him.
And this doth right unto him that is simple, and rebellious, because he is full of old calls, that he may look upon him from the bed with suspicion.
That it just doesn't have a way of accepting the natural attempt to order it.
Adolescents are not allowed to get caught, they are not allowed to be imposed restrictions.
Ori, if I'm impressed that I am doing it, she's kind of upset with her.
And, unfortunately, when a rigid person is found in the chamber, which is imposed by duration and does not communicate, the students are opposed to the given object.
I'm thousands of young people who miss meetings with great writers, unfortunately because of the lack of tact on the part of the Romanian teacher.
I'm thousands of students who have the impression that history is a data collection, that mathematics is everything that can be more difficult for their incomprehensible mind.
I always reward my students: if you give them to a teacher you don't touch, who doesn't know how to communicate as from man to man with you, don't let him separate you from the literature to which you should be treated.
How did it happen when I became myself?
I had a very good teacher in the VI-VIII classes.
He has opened my mind to some texts that have been speaking to the baby since then on his understanding.
I met a university professor who opened my door to his libraries.
I looked at him as a man from other parts of the world: he had walls of a house covered with hard books.
I lost myself in his library and I wanted to have one.
Now I might have it, but if I hadn't taken my shirt off my way, I might have decided to make me a football player.
Or an engineer or a lawyer or someone else knows what.
I don't think such meetings are happening.
I don't think so.
It's essential that you pass over the man who takes you out of his hand and patiently push you to your own vote.
And this is, for the most part, the professor.
Now, my experience helps me to discuss just what it means to preach literature.
It's just that literature can't be bought.
There's no literature teacher, just like there's a math teacher.
How do you define the infamous?
You can, at least, close to it, without claiming to convey the truth that you have been taught.
The one from the cathedral can be as much a guide to reading, that's all else.
But especially can you enjoy some wonderful meetings, between a reader and some books.
There are meetings that can change the life of the bank.
There are meetings that I can open her mind, that I can raise her, talk to someone, tears in her eyes.
Therefore, first of all, the literature teacher must be able to make students understand (to feel) that between literature and life there is no divorce.
Diptoriva!
A great treasure, Al. Palelogu, says one thing just looks paradoxical: "How much literature, so much life, not reverse!" and was right.
That's why a good piece of paper prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in an open area anyway.
Happily, we've always learned some things.
And we, professors; or especially us, professors.
More often than not, it simply repeats a great truth: not only the students have learned from their masters, but also from the reverse.
In an ideal way, the teacher should be a teacher and raise a child.
Which, like any valuable young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own way.
At least I find him, he's right.
But the master was the one who opened the sanctuary.
I don't think there's more happiness for a purely blood teacher than that to endure as many such divisions.

FIFA is being investigated throughout
The justice of the US and Switzerland will lead to new arrests
The US and Switzerland authorities have announced that criminal prosecutions will begin in the case of new persons and organisations, in the context of the FIFA corruption investigation, inform the international press.
US Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced in a press conference in Zurich that global football research had been expanded in months.
"On the basis of our cooperation and on the basis of new evidence, we will commit additional penalties to the address of new individuals and new organisations," Lynch said.
In May, more senior FIFA officials were arrested in Switzerland in this case of corruption.
Many of them have already been extradited in the United States.
"We have hope that other criminal follow-up people will reach the U.S.," added Lynch.
Elvetia's Attorney General, Michael Lauber, also present at the press conference, stated that his institution has been focusing on more goods, including housing and land in the Alps, as well as financial assets, in the context of the investigation carried out in collaboration with the US.
"I didn't even get to the end of the first round," said Lauber.
So far, a very large amount of information has been confiscated, 11 terabytes.
All the time, 121 bank accounts are investigated.
In the attention of the investigators, a contract for awarding media rights to the World Cup 2010 in South Africa and in 2014 - Brazil.
FIFA faces a major corruption scandal after the US justice has accused 14 people, including two FIFA Vice-Presidents and seven Forum officials.
Detained persons have been researched for hundreds and other uses since the early 1990s and so far, totalling more than 150 million dollars.
Following this scandal, Swissman Joseph Blatter announced, at the beginning of July, that he was decommissioned from the role of FIFA President after it was real for the fifth time.
Battle as a movie at the theater
In Milan's Supekombat Gala, East Cátálin Moroşanu will fight "the beast" James Wilson
A number of Romanian fighters, including the "scorpion" Cátálin Moroşanu, will take part, on 2 October, in the Superkombat Gala from the Milan Linear 4 Ciaak theatre, the last before the end of November, appears in a press release MEDIAFAX.
We were impressed by the atmosphere last year, and as I promised, we'll be back in this tome with a new five star gale.
If we've always chosen a place of entertainment, a theater, then we promise to fight like a movie.
We'll have eight Romanian fighters in the event program.
Along with the mixed views already dedicated, we will have another gallery open, which will include the best fighters of the new generation, including Roman Cristi Speccu, Christian Stancu and Amansio Paraschiv.
"It will soon be announced and the full programme will be announced," promoter Eduard Iremia said.
Cátálin Moroșanu will fight in the Superkombat World Grand Prix Final Elimination Galway with American James Wilson, known as the last pyramid in Japan and numerous prizes from bodybuilding competitions in 2012.
I was just waiting to fight in Italy.
I saw Wilson, it's really an animal, but I'm demoralizing him!
I'm still angry I couldn't fight last year, so now I'm going to fight him.
"From the animal he turns into a cat," said Morošanu.
In 2015, the brothers Andrei and Bogdan Stoica will have their last encounters in Italy before fighting for world titles on 7 November in the final sea.
Last year, both of them were taken by KO in Italy, and now I promise they'll resume the scenario.
I'm glad I'm back in Italy. Last year's atmosphere was incredible.
"I'm just waiting to meet the fans from there and promise them a new show of innocence," said World Championship Andrei Stoica.
Milano will also fight Raul Cătinaš with an opponent that follows to be established.
A girl invited the Queen of England to her day, but also wrote her a letter.
A British girl sent Queen Elizabeth an invitation to participate in her birthday.
At the same time, the six-year-old girl congratulated the Queen for her longest gentleman, but did not forget to mention that she did not allow her access to the Buckingham House when she went to visit her family.
The writing didn't go without ecou, but the girl received an answer from the representatives of the Royal House.
Queen thanked her for the invitation, but she asked and apologized that she could not be present on September 27, so she even hated having fun with family and friends.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together to a talk show shortly before the poet Adrian Păunescu died.
Both writers died of heart disease.
The fate of Adrian Păunescu and Vadim Tudor is similar.
They were both writers and politicians and they both felt at close age, from the heart.
Adrian Păunescu at 67 years of age, Vadim Tudor at 65 years of age.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together in 2010, shortly before Adrian Păunescu died, at a TV Realty exhibition.
Full of wine, Vadim Tudor ironed Gheorghe Flutur and criticised Elena Udrea, Minister of Tourism since then, for the situation of Romanian tourism.
At a certain point, Vadim Tudor told Adrian Păunescu, with his smile on his face, "I am indifferent to your posthumous glory, Adrian."
I sneezed, and he answered, "It's not too glorious what you told me right now."
Adrian Păunescu died on 5 November 2010, at the age of 67.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor was born today, 14 September 2015, at the age of 65.
Two people not aware of a Dumbrava accident
An accident took place last night at around 19:00 in the Dumbrava district of Iaşi.
A biker was taken up by a Volkswagen car.
The ciclist was not observed by the driver.
Happily, they're both stable.
As a result of the impact, the paint and mirror of the machines were dispersed.
Two injured persons are unaware of the hour of transmission of this news.
A SMURD team is on its way to give medical assistance to the victims and transport them to the hospital.
The cops are right next to the place.
A Syrian artist turned "Super Mario" into a refugee
A Syrian artist has created a version of the popular game "Super Mario", which highlights the difficult situation of his fellows, on their way to Europe.
Instead of presenting Italian installer Mario's adventures in the Kingdom of Cyprus, the modified video game has its focus on "The Mario Refugees".
The person is trying to avoid trafficking in persons and border police on his way to a European Union refugee centre.
The artist established in Istanbul uses the pseudonym Samir al-Mufti for security reasons and declared that he had performed the video game with Mario refugees after his friends had embarked on a dangerous journey to Europe to escape the horrors of the war.
At the Craiova detention centre the youngest student is 15 years old and is in Class I
Minister of Justice Robert Cazancic said, at the opening of the school year at the Craiova detention centre, that the youngest student is 15 years old and is in class I, and the oldest is 25 years old and is in class XI, showing that they could have a different life if they went to school.
I have chosen to participate in opening the school year at a centre belonging to the National Pensions Administration to try to attract attention, and in this way, on less-known realities.
The youngest student, aged 15, is enrolled in Class I and the oldest is 25 years old and is enrolled in Class XI.
"There are complex subjects that the company is concerned about discussing at this time, we are all overwhelmed by our own concerns and problems, but we do not need to go through with the lesson that these over 100 young people from the Craiova detention centre offer," said Minister Robert Cazancic at the opening festival of the school year.
The Minister of Justice drew attention to the fact that the lack of education, caused in many cases by the lack of material opportunities, may lead to tragedies, stating that young people in this centre would have another chance in life if they could follow the formal school course of any child, if they had the opportunity to learn not only to write, read, but also to receive a set of moral values, find out what it means to respect the law and what its consequences could be.
"The role of the prison system is not to isolate permanent societies of people who have violated the law, to close them behind high walls, but to try to rehabilitate and prepare them, because when they return to the community they have more chance of reintegration," Cazanic added.
The Minister pointed out that it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, roads, but investment and the prison system must be made, because in many cases, conditions of detention are within the limits of humanity and because, in the absence of money and staff, it will be difficult to talk about reintegration of convicted persons.
We work very well with the Ministry of Education and because of this partnership, each year, in the prison system, there are more than 2000 graduates of school education courses.
Of course, we won't be able to change over the nights that haven't been done for 25 years, but these are important steps we've been doing.
"In all these disappointments we need the support of society, and this support can only come if we prove that we are doing our duty, that these young people have a chance and do not represent a risk to society," Cazanic added.
The Ministry of Justice has hated both students and educators, showing that success comes only through the combined efforts of all.
"And because today is the celebration of the Holy Cross Summit, I would invite all the students and teachers to visit the Musollah from Soveja, Marasti and not only to understand what it means to fight for ideals," said Robert Cazancious.
A Russian came to the vote with the mouse
Doctoral schools got two crying to be disillusioned!
Request for scholarship university students from Yaşi and the country
More than 200 researchers, universities, personalities and students from the country signed an application from the Romanian Academy of Sciences and Education Society asking the Ministry of Education and Research to assess, punish and even establish medical schools in Romania "which allows and promotes academic taxation".
Among the petition signatories launched on 10 September are students and teachers from Iaşi.
Among the university signatories of the original academic environment is Professor Livius Antonese.
At the national level, the petition has names from the other ministers of Education, such as Mircea Miquea, from people of culture who are also university students, such as Andrei Pleșu, Aurora Liceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
"While the Education Act provides for the evaluation of medical schools, this fact has not been carried out so far, thus determining the lack of concrete sanctions for medical schools which are clearly in line with the ethical rules of scientific research and do not produce relevant and internationally recognized performance," states the application.
This request specifically requires compliance with the National Education Act, the evaluation of doctoral schools, suspension of the right to work for any doctoral school in which more than two complaints have been found, until the assessment and remedying of the situation.
The last requirement is to suspend the right to work for any doctoral school where there is no minimum number of doctoral drivers provided for by law to meet the criteria set by the National Research Council in 2011 for the eligibility of IDEI project grants.
Do you respect less a general without a doctorate, or a politician, or an informant in the Middle East?
"Why is there no other Academy in Europe to provide doctors with secret services, and senior soldiers who give their doctor do so to the independent academic institutions, where quality is verified by the academic environment?" said Alina Mungiu-Pipidi, president of the Romanian Academy Society, the founder of the petition, the original one and the former one of Yaşi.
This may be completed by all the wishes on the Society's website and final signatures will be sent by the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for 3 people with money, but 10,000 who want to get involved.
The "Pentru Iași" party, founded by young IT non-political managers, was launched in Copou Park.
The President of the "Pentru Iași" Initiative Group gave an interview "The Day of Iaşi"
Yausu will have a dedicated party exclusively to the development of the city.
A group of non-political entrepreneurs and managers so far launched at the end of last week's Party for Iași organisation which will propose candidates for local elections in 2016.
The party's core is now composed of IT specialists, but the training institutes say that there are welcome in the organization all people who will be involved in modernising the city.
The launch took place Saturday, in the Copou park, and at the event over 200 sympathizers participated, almost all of them young.
The special invitation of the action was nicusór Dan, President of the Association Save the Bucharest.
He was surprised at the local elections in 2012, when, as independent, he managed to raise 10% of the votes of the members for the capital's primary role.
"The people I've seen at the "Iaşi" think they're very good to have access to the public administration of Iaş".
I believe in this initiative, I think it has a chance, I think it may have more opportunities in a community less than the one in Bucharest.
"You'll always be with "Pentru Iași," said Nicoşor Dan.
ZDI: Why didn't you leave Yaşi to work in an IT company abroad?
Andrei Postolache: The reasons are more emotional and emotional.
I've been gone on many short business trips, I've lived a year in Cluj.
I've come back every time, 'cause I feel like this is my house.
ZDI: Why did you now decide to form a political party?
Andrei Postolache:Now we have reached a certain maturity, we are a group of people who have been getting to know us for a while.
We met in professional contexts, we started discussing how we could involve ourselves.
At first, we were more concerned, in smaller things, with projects at NGOs, various activities or charity, and somehow things have evolved natural and organic and now it has happened to be the time when we reached the decision that we must involve more than that.
ZDI: Name three concrete projects for improving the activity of local public administration!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of at least information on primary activities so that different departments, institutions and regions can work together as well.
But more importantly, it can publish transparent data on detailed activities: budgets, reports, projects, etc. We are talking about information organisation.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a particular folder, public consultation of the affected people is important.
If we're talking about efficiency, we don't have to forget transport in common, we have the worst buses in the country.
You need to buy new means of transport.
ZDI: Today, the image of a city is very much.
How did you promote Yasul?
Andrei Postolache: You're on the plane and you're looking for investors from this world.
There are conferences, industrial events where you can "sell" the city.
You have to want to do this and know to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and we brought customers to Iaşi.
ZDI: What is the flag of Yasús?
Andrei Postolache: My opinion is that we must be a city of technology in one way or another.
We already have the IT industry and we have to expand it, go to medicine, enter the robotic area, in 3D printing, continue in this spirit and join such elements.
I think the brand should be in the science area, I'm referring here to the modern brand of the city.
Of course, Yasul already has a historic brand that must not be changed, that is, cultural cities.
I see the two elements in balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for the lack of experience in public administration, as well as the lack of traditional party structures that still win elections in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: Administration is a form of management, which means organizing, planning, communicating, working with people and projecting.
We have experience in management.
We don't want traditional structures, we don't care.
We want to involve people, we'll talk to everyone, we won't just stay on Facebook, we're not online party.
We don't want to have "voluntaries" brought with the bus.
That means we're based on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think there's enough people like this.
ZDI: Should the Iasian Prime Minister be more concerned about promoting the city's image at national and international level, or is it necessary for the air of concern to remain in a working state?
Andrei Postolache: One without another does not work.
First of all, you have to solve today's problems, the emergencies.
But if you don't get to know the city, if you don't bring money into the city, at a time you're not going to be able to do it without money, for example, you're not going to be able to do it anymore.
You have to do both at the same time and you need competent people.
The Prime Minister doesn't have to do everything.
We have to give up the primary-tap model, which comes and fights with the powder in the table and solve everything.
No. No.
We're a team.
The prime is the coordinator of a orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract business people from the IT area who can support the party financially?
Andrei Postolache: We're looking for people who want to do something good, have a reputation that's harmless, be honest and honorable.
From this point of view, we don't have any other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or why not, 300,000 people who want to get involved and do something for the city.
Interview by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache works in the IT industry for nearly 15 years.
In July 2015, the Introspecials company was established, after which for seven years it was the director of the International Group of Endava (2008 - 2015), where it coordinated a team of 300 people.
Other four years (2003 - 2007) took him to Syngy.
The company which established it along with another IT specialist provides management consulting services.
The Rapla treatment program has proved to be a failure
The Director General of SC IRUM SA Reghin, Mircea Oltean, stated that the National Park of tractors and Agricultural Machines, launched in 2011, also known as Rabla for tractors, was an example of bureaucracy.
As regards the Rabla Program, there have been some attempts in recent years, but it proved to be an error, because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for a farmer on the ground, and the approvals were too long and then the world gave up.
This program has succeeded in selling 10 pieces somewhere.
"The need for treatment for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces of food," Mircea Oltean said.
According to this, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces several hundred of its annual treatment, being the largest in Romania, and that the great competition is exercised by foreign companies, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
It's a very big competition with those who come out, all world producers have eyes on Romania, I know these things I told you, and they have special policies.
"In all markets there is great agglomeration, all producers exhibit, come with all sorts of variants," highlighted Mircea Oltean, who explained that IRUM Reghin produces about 500 agricultural and forestry treatments annually.
Through the Rabla Treatment Programme, launched in 2011, those holding old or other self-propelled treatments, such as combinations, could be awarded and received in exchange for a value tag of 17,000 hers.
The red flag has been lifted
The internal scrutinise of workers appears to be more spectacular and politically significant, as the new election leader becomes automatically his launching crown in the future elections.
You're raised, so, the red-aprins/ Under his shoulders we'll live and die.
That's what he sang yesterday, Jeremy Corbyn in the London People's Holy House.
She's been witnessing a lot of facts and assurances/Let's not change her color now.
Readers who do not know the melodic line of this unofficial name of the British and International Left (The Red Flag) can search the Internet and would not be excluded from a surprise.
With the heads discovered, let's swear with all that we'll wear until we get dressed.
The author of these lines is not only an admirer of the reds (and neither of those that float them), but also respect the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn succeeds in joining the left with tomorrow, this story of love between him and the base of the Labour Party will be part of a happy-end.
I don't think that's gonna happen like this, but I think it's too early to talk about the sea and the inevitable electrical explosion, over five years, of an alternative election leader.
Now, however, we can refer to the procedures: we have attended a democratic exercise of an impressive horror.
Not British workers have invented the system of direct vote for the party leader around the western left.
French socialists have been working for several years on a more complex system, based on motivations, which allows all members and sympathizers to express themselves; in addition, they have organised a preliminary competition for appointment of the candidate to the presidential office in 2012.
However, the internal examination of workers appears to be more spectacular and politically significant, as the new election leader becomes his senior launching in the future elections.
It is, of course, and a matter of political system, the personalization of power is more pronounced in the British Sea than in the rest of the Canal of Mane.
In addition, participation in the vote was great in all three "searches": self-employed members, union members and other organisations associated with the party and finally the group of sympathizers (which received the ballot card after a summary registration procedure).
This latter group provides us with interesting information on the perceptions of the left-wing segments of British society, especially those formed by young or old middle-aged people, educated, interested in political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to become more involved in the future just because of the sign offered by Corbyn's victory.
There are no sociological surveys I know that tell us too much about the attitudes of this labist "external search", so careful speculation is allowed.
I think we're dealing with a lot of attitudes like those of the Podemos (Spain) or even SYRIZA (Greece), noting that they're going to track the traditional channels of the left.
If we keep identifying a "antisystem" call, it is primarily reflected by the rejection of the centralist line, New Labour (for many, only a disembodied form of multi-hullism thatcherism).
The second component would be the review of the leaders considered guilty of the two successive electoral failures, one of the arguments being that they did not go enough to the left, that they did not clearly delimited from Tony Blair's time.
The second reper - after me, and most likely - is offered by the recent referendum on the independence of Scotland.
If we draw away from the separatist message and focus strictly on the aspirations of other political topics, we see how Scottish nationalists have captured the energy of social public segments that are in favour of the state and are encouraged by the aspirations of equity, the right to disarmament and the obstacles of military involvement over decisions, but are always sensitive to the new themes of the left: ecology, gene, assistance for the poor countries.
The Scottish workers thus lost an electorate who should have, at least in principle, a privileged access, but which I can now recover (see their enthusiasm towards Corbyn's campaign).
Such energy exists throughout the United Kingdom, but old leadership has not been able to attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his voice outsider, has more chances of success than Ed Miliband, "aristocrat" laburist.
The comparison with Scotland tells us more, I think, than the one with the left anti-system from Europe's southern peripheral.
The term "antisystem" is too hard: "anti-setting" seems more appropriate to me.
By next week we'll find out more about Jeremy Corbyn's first step as opposition leader.
We'll see if there's no red flag going up in the House of Commons (it wouldn't be for the first time), after the new leader has taken his place, in the first place in the opposition banks.
Anyway, what Jeremy Corbyn wants right now from his colleagues in Parliament is primarily unity - and in this regard he has reason to be concerned.
Head of manipulating with or without knowledge
While I wrote the article, I went through my head to check on the history of the former fighter and "Sirian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became part of the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marin his person "Jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could themselves make me from the start of the circus.
I didn't.
In the last week's article (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") I commented in the parallel two pictures – the boy Aylan Kurdi was found dead on the Mediterranean and, in fact, the two making him a Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a fighter, the second time as a refugee.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh was taken from the article "Syrian Fighters Come With the Valley of Refugees" (meaned by Viorica Marin on September 3rd).
Monday night, I put a link to my article on my Facebook page.
Tuesday, entering Facebook, I found, among other things, a hand drag from the friend (not just from the FB) Marius Christian: "Subscribe, rather than a statement. Laith of Saleh is not a Jihadist".
On the contrary, he is a fighter against Al Assad, for democracy and for alleviation.
"So that you could add the grosola into the table"!
I have to admit, I felt angry.
As much as I wrote the article passed me through my head to check on the history of the former warrior and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became part of the second space dedicated by V. Marin his "Jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could themselves make me from the start of the circus.
Because I had faith in the Truth, in his journalists.
Instead, I had no further comment on the hand-drawn by Marius Cristian than this: "That's what I need if I (have) believed in the Truth"
After that, I obviously took the money from the story and I feel indebted to the readers with the correct presentation of the Syrian story Laith Al-Saleh.
The oldest I found it in a material from the Associated Press (Syrian rebel leader sexes Europe - Syrian rebel leader seeking Europe) signed by Nicholas Baphitis and Dalton Bennett on 17 August 2015 on the island of Kos in Greece, where they noticed, among the hundreds, thousands of refugees, a man who is trying to order the crowd.
The man was Syrian student Laith Al Saleh of Aleppo who "was used to be at the command" since "he led a 700 rebel unit in the civil war in Syria".
We find that Al Saleh, at the age of 30, warned "a house, a wife and a normal life before the war began which cost more than 250,000 lives and placed a third of the Syrian population on the streets".
In an interview with the Associated Press correspondents, Al Saleh says "the whole world wants to leave Syria".
My city is the most dangerous city in the world.
About 70 percent of the city is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (a extremist group of the Islamic State) wants me, the government wants me – I have fought against everyone.
Besides being thrown out of a supermarket on the island, Kos would have offered "a meeting and more left - with a man who recognized a Syrian enemy": "Two days ago, I saw a Mondayist from government forces."
I didn't talk to him, but I'm still very angry.
From material we find that Laith (which means leu in Arabic) was, in fact, on his way to Holland, where he had a truth - he was a senior officer in the Syrian army and then he rebelled and arrived in the West after he was seriously injured - hoping to get asylum and can bring his family then - his wife and a three-year-old boy (almost old with the civil war in Syria, which erupted in March 2011).
After this will have been accomplished, Laith Al-Saleh would not have excluded a return to Syria to continue the struggle for the Syrian Free Army (supported by the West) - against three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (supported by the Russian), the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
A fool - who wants freedom must fight in Syria, not one enemy, but three!
I gave more than a Serbian material on August 22, of which I didn't understand a great deal, but Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists who come once with migrants: Terrorists CRIJU MIGRANTIMA sounds the title of a news from http://www.telograph.rs/vest, in which they are added a picture with Al Saleh with a beard holding a Syrian flag in hand and that refugee wearing the shirt with "THANK YOU".
On September 7, then, itself on the BBC site, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of manipulating with the help of the Syrian fighter: This viral photo false claims to show an IS fighter poses a refugee - This viral post is mistakenly claiming to be a fighter of the Islamic State that can be found in refugees.
We find that the picture (in fact: pictures - the one with Laith with barb and gun and the one with the THANK YOU triangle) was posted by a user on Facebook, who would have been and would have apologized between time.
Just before that, just on its walls, the picture with the two pictures would have been shared over 70,000 times, adding a few thousand comments.
That word, too late, the horse goes away!
In Romania, on September 9, Carla Dino from Hotnews took the story with the manipulation of BBC, but mistranslated the title: "A false photo became viral shows an ISIS fighter while he was right to flee."
Of course, not the photograph is false, but the interpretation was a false, wrong, shorthand: manipulation.
