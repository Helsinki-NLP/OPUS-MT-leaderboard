Members of the Gales Country Assembly receive "passing by Mars"
There is confusion on the part of some Members of the Gales Country Assembly (AM) regarding the suggestion that their title should be changed to MWP (Members of the French Parliament).
The origin of this controversy is in plans to change the name of the assembly for "Gallès Parliament".
Some members of this assembly, from all political colors, thought that this would make them fall into the ridiculous.
An AM worker said that the group is concerned about "the appointment to stay with Twp and Pwp".
For non-galese readers: "twp" means "idiota" and pwp means "excreements".
A Plaid AM said that the group in its globality "was not content" and suggested alternatives.
A French conservative said that the group was of "open mind" in relation to the change in the name, but mentioned that the MWP designation was literally very close to Muppet (Marteta).
In this context, the letter w in French has a statement similar to the letter or in English from Yorkshire.
The Committee on Assembly, currently drafting legislation to introduce amendments to the name, stated: "The final decision on how Members of the House are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave its Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which included general support for the proposal to designate the Assembly by "Galès Parliament".
On the issue of the title of the AM, the Commission favoured "Galès Parliament Members", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favourable in public consultation.
The AMs are apparently suggesting alternatives, but the effort to bring together the consensus can be a headache for President Elin Jones, who should present a draft legislation on changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the way the Assembly carries out its activities, such as the rules on non-qualification of AMs and the configuration of the system of commissions.
When they discuss legislation, the AM will have the final word on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonia will refer to the change in the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday on the change in the name of their country to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was organised in an attempt to resolve a decade's conflict with Greece's neighbor, which integrates a province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has been very insistent that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim on its territory, having repeatedly raised objections to its applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposition to the plebiscyto on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, the rapporteur's supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name is no more than the price paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Synos appeared at a time when the churches of Harlem fought for survival
"No historical perspective, the old people I talked to told me there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's no one or no other."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, understood.
"People socialize differently" today, he said.
"The bars have ceased to be the rooms of being out of the neighborhood where people are heading on a regular basis."
As far as the churches are concerned, it is concerned about the possibility of money gain with the sale of property not to last as long as the leaders expect" and that sooner or later, everything will return exactly to the starting point."
The churches, he added, can be replaced by predominances of apartments with condoms inhabited by the type of people who will not support the saints in the village that are still in existence.
"The majority of the people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore, this will precipitate the arrival of the day when all these churches will be closed, because it is unlikely that most of those who change to these complexes will join these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation came out of here in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was then moved by a black congregation that carried out its worship in the immediate vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverdo John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the laymen of 125th Street, an important commercial street in Harlem that resists the recruitment and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged. However, when the plans were made for its reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the carriage.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called "the sons of the poor".
The specialist who played the chariot in July called it another thing: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This specialist, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, also mentioned that it was the world's first carillion to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the largest carillion in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace it.
What happened in St. Martin's last month was a complicated story of architects and competitors, some brought by church leaders laymen and others by episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the leading body of the parish consisting of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that this "procury would cover its costs" was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tubarón causes injuries in a 13-year-old adolescent in a dog hunt in California
A tiger attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a hunting trip to the lake in California on the first day of the lake season, the authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been surfing with friends for about half an hour as he heard the boy cry for help, then returned to his direction with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought it was just enthusiasm that he had caught a lagosta, but then he found out that the boy cried "I'm dead!"
I was murdered!
The entire keyboard area was spread out, Hammel described what he observed when he arrived at the boy.
"I cried everyone out of the water: "There's a tube in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to a critical state.
The type of tuberone responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles' life-saving said in a press release that had been warned by a tube in the area a few weeks ago, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the throne.
The authorities closed access from Point Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation and for security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 tuberculosis species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sanisbury's plans to enter the United Kingdom cosmetic market
Saninsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic sections in the style of large stores, supported by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to get a share on the United Kingdom cosmetic market, estimated at 2.8 billion pounds, which has continued to grow while sales of fashion and articles for the countryside are falling short, these larger cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 stores scattered by the country and will be implemented in more shops in the coming year if their success has been demonstrated.
This cosmetic investment stems from the search, by supermarkets, for ways to use another exposure space used for TVs, microwaves and articles for the village.
Sanisbury's mentioned that she would double her beauty product catalogue with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with brand areas similar to stores like Boots.
The network of supermarkets is also starting its Boutique makeup range so that most products obey vegan preceeds, something more demanding by younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume store The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two shops Saninsbury's, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London, last week. It is expected that the second, in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, will open near the end of the year.
Online purchases and changing food purchase habits for small daily quantities in nearby shops led Supermarkets to now have to work harder to persuade customers to visit their shops.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Saninsbury's, said that shops are becoming more and more like big stores, at a time when the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discount shops with more services and non-food products.
Saninsbury's has come to install Argos sales points in hundreds of shops, has also installed a series of Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, and says it strengthened sales of commodity products and made the most profitable purchases.
The company's previous attempt to renew its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Saninsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a difference on the distribution of revenue from health products stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy arises after Saninsbury's has sold its pharmaceutical business three years ago with 281 sales points to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four shops an extended range of luxury brands for skin care such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Saninsbury's, said: "We have transformed the aspect and essence of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, which will be available to advise the customer.
Our brand range has been designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistable point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of buying."
Peter Jones "frust" after Holly Willoughby has left business of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, remained "heavy" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby has left a business of 11 million pounds with its lifestyle brand to concentrate on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of articles for the village and accessories Truly.
The business of both had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of this morning, 37 years old, announced in Instagram that he would leave the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones alive by leaving the lucrative brand in the last minute to concentrate on his new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say that Jones remained "heavy" when the gold girl on TV admitted, during a three-day meeting at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new businesses (which value may amount to 1.5 million pounds), meant that she would not have time to dedicate herself to her brand of articles from the village and accessories Truly.
The business was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37 years old, announced in the Instagram that he would leave Truly, Jones caught a plane for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said: "Truly was far more than Holly's priorities.
It would mean the resolution of its future in the long term and would be a financial support for the next two decades.
His decision to leave was all absolutely frightened.
No one believed what was happening on Wednesday... was so close to the launch.
There's a lot of articles ready to sell at Marlow's headquarters."
Experts believe that this morning's presentation, which is among the most lucrative views of Britain, can cost millions to the company, given the advanced investment in products, which go from carpets and see clothes and articles for the village, and the potential for additional delays in the launch.
In addition, it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and Dan Baldwin's husband, are close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp ten years ago.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined the project as president in March.
Houses make holidays together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin TV production.
Willoughby is ready to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the representative of I'm I'm The ITV Celebrity.
A nearby source from Jones said last night that "We do not intend to comment on their business".
Long conversation "and then we fall in love"
The President of the United States has rightly mentioned the criticisms that would be addressed to the media by making a comment that some would consider as "no president" and by revealing such a positive attitude with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump fall into such a state?
Trump said, in his voice, "Televisional beer."
"I didn't fall into anything."
He pointed out that Kim is interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, pointing out that it would be a great step in the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization are under way.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the most important North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that the North does not see a " corresponding response " from the United States to the first steps towards disarmament in North Korea.
Instead, he referred to the US continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump adopted a more optimistic point of view in his speech at the beginning.
"It's running very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were ready to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
Trump stated that his efforts to improve Kim's relationship have produced positive results: the end of the fire tests, support for the release of hostages and return to the country of the deaths of North American military.
In addition, he defended his involving approach when he spoke in relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this superlotted arena, we'd have about 200 people on foot right here," said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause destruction on an island, causing hundreds of people to die
For example, at the end of the Lombok earthquake it was said to foreign non-governmental organizations that the same was not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had been displaced, national disasters were not declared a pre-requisite for the channelling of international aid.
"Unfortunately, it has been clear in many cases that they are not seeking international assistance; therefore, it becomes a bit difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children are organizing a team that will be headed to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, the national response agency's spokesman for disasters, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies were allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant earthquake suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly poorly prepared for the heat of nature.
Although they have been built in Aceh, against tsunamis are not publicly warned in other coastal lines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a series of Tsunami alarms in Palu, badly affected by the presence of a warning, had contributed to the loss of life.
In the most favorable times, travel between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of earthquakes is on the way to Palu, but it will last at least three days to arrive at the location of this new disaster.
President Joko Widodo, who did the improvement of the infrastructure depreciated a central part of his electoral campaign, spent huge amounts of roads and roads.
However, the lack of funding has resulted in the execution of Mr Joko, at a time when he faced his reelection next year.
The President is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were evacuated while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other handguns.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes a long finish for the plague of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea, with a hole in the 89th minute of the Saturday, at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's ball, with his team losing for 1-0.
He gave a touch to his left before making an end to the second step.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the big area when heading towards the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell on an Arrizabalaga in flight and fell into the network.
"I was just trying to reach this position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq are making the best possible progress, so I was just getting the maximum time possible," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I've come to Kante, I've got a touch and I didn't think too much about it. I just finished."
Chelsea won by 1-0 at the interval after marking a hole in the 25th minute, from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this game, the advance of the blues gave a step back to Matthew Kovacic before unmarking near the middle-field and making a sprint towards Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick move to the middle-field.
Then he made a beautiful finish that passed through the opposite defense, leading Hazard to the big area.
This crossed the defenses and made the hole against the second network through with a finish with the left foot that passed through the Alison Becker guards of Liverpool.
Liverpool faces Naples in the phase of groups of the League of Champions on Wednesday afternoon at St. Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face the Videoton in the UEFA European Union at 3 p.m. in London.

The statute of Cromwell of Parliament became the most recent solemn monument for the content of "historic revisionism"
Its removal would be an act of poetic justice by its destruction, which reminds us of the experience of the Taliban, of so many cultural and religious English artifacts, and which was carried out by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a crazy" and "a attempt to rewrite History".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that, in the current debate on the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell's figure next to the Westminster Palace would become a target to fall.
The iconoclastia of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed by the acts of his former Thomas in the previous century.
The great representation of Cromwell, author of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a witness to the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many still believe to be worthy of honor.
Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is faced by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in its case, of the monarchy.
If this is the case or not a fully accurate description is the subject of a historical debate that continues.
What is true is that the middle of the 17th century conflict has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual fame that represents one side of this division.
Their successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and remembrance."
Why the killer attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to reports of local media.
The man, identified only by his call "Yuan", was found dead, with a cut and covered blood artery, near a pocilga on the market in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, reads in South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The suiniculator is prepared to inject vaccines in pigs in a suinic culture on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he will have traveled with the first from the nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and discovered a door for an open neighborhood.
At this pocilage, he said, he was a big pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, with 227 kilograms, had attacked the pig grower until death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered with blood and crushed, he said the first, referred to by his "Wu," according to the Guiyang Evening News.
The security cameras films show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Friday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent other people from attacking while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Reports state that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of dog attacks have already been reported to human beings.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in her fifth in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 300-kiln pig mobilized a Galician farmer against its tractor until the woman was able to scare the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon had been eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that blood smell can work as "stimulation".
"They're just playing.
They're very curious... they don't want to hurt anybody.
We just need to show them the due respect," he said.
The Rosa storm should bring strong rains generalised to the west of the United States
As is expected, Rosa's oven is weakening when it moves over the coldest waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains to the whole north and south of the United States in the next days.
At 5 a.m., Sunday's East Time, Rosa caused a runaway of 137 km/h, a category 1, which is located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
However, it begins to take the form of depression over the Pacific Ocean moving to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the peninsula of the Baja California, Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical humidity towards the north in the southern United States area.
On Tuesday, it will cause precipitation which may reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At this point, the tropical moisture to interact with the near depression will produce strong rains generalised in the South-East in the next few days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain may result in dangerous, hazardous, soil-rich floods and, possibly, landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause precipitations that can reach 5 to 7 mm in point areas, especially in parts south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to be up to 5 to 10 mm precipitation in Southeast areas, especially on most of Arizona.
There are possible sudden floods with conditions in rapid worsening, due to the widespread nature of tropical rain.
It is highly unsound to walk in the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
The strong precipitation can make the disfigurers turn into brave rivers and the found will bring strong peak winds and rain clouds of dust.
The near depression will result in strong precipitation on parts of the southern California coastal line.
A total precipitation of more than 12 mm is possible, which may cause small damages and skeletal roads.
This may be the first precipitation of the wet station in the region.
There will begin in Arizona some tropical waters scattered at the end of the Sunday and at the beginning of the afternoon, before the rain becomes more widespread at the end of the afternoon and on the third.
The strong rain will spread into the Four Corners on Wednesday and will last up to four.
The month of October can record strong temperature variations throughout the U.S. territory as Artico recovers, however, tropical areas will remain quite threat.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature in short distances.
There is an excellent example of the dramatic differences in temperature throughout the central area of the United States on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, persistent summer temperatures will tend to increase and expand again.
It is expected that most of the central and eastern U.S. area will be marked by a hot start from October, with temperatures ranging from 27 to 30 degrees south to North-East.
New York City can reach 27 degrees on Wednesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of high temperatures occurring above the average in the eastern United States until the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended the audience of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people attended the six television stations of Brett Kavanaugh's witness to the Supreme Court, and of the woman who accused him of sexually abused in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
However, the political impasse continued, with the stations interrupting regular programming due to a change of time: an agreement drawn up by Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona to allow the FBI to conduct a week's investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate's Court of Justice that he had absolute confidence that Kavanaugh had arrested her while she was pregnant and tried to expel her at a school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflammated witness, stated that he has absolute certainty that this has not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, number confirmed by Nielsen on Saturday, have attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of spectators in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The number of other stations that sent it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, was not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulties in measuring hearings of those who see programmes in offices.
To give some perspective, this is a level of hearings similar to the end of an American football game or the Oscares ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to Kavanaugh's appointment, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the hearing that lasted all day, referred to Nielsen.
The ABC stood second with 3.26 million spectators.
Then came CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen referred to it.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the sixth-to-first drama.
After the Bureau of the moderate Republican has issued a statement stating that its vote would be in favour of Kavanaugh, the senator was caught by the CNN and CBS cameras in the morning of Friday when he tried to enter a elevator to conduct a hearing by the Judicial Commission.
The senator remained invisible to look at the floor while he was criticised directly for CNN cameras.
"I'm here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
She was told that "you have power as long as so many women have no power."
Flake stated that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that it would have more to say in the hearing of the committee.
The cable and radio stations were all covering the event directly hours later when the Court of Justice voted to make Kavanaugh's appointment continue for a vote at a plenary session of the Senate.
However, Flake stated that it would only do so in the sense that the FBI would investigate the charges against the appointed over the next week, which the democratic minority had come to demand.
Flake was partly convinced after conversations with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and, later, with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation by the FBI on allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political making" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of his plans to leave the European Union "political" with the future of Britain and to undermine national interest, in an interview to the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, comes to the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In an interview with him on the first page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as "Checkers Plan" by the Minister for Brexit, stating that a proposal which provides for Britain and the EU to cover the other party's prices is "completely absurd".
The murder of Wade Sims: Police arrest the suspect Dyteon Simpson of the death of the LSU player
The police held a suspicion of Sims' mortal shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and charged with murder in the second grade, according to a communication from the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published a video of the comparison between Sims and Simpson, having the police said Sims lost his eyes during the struggle.
The police recovered them at the scene of the incident and declared that they had found in Simpson's DNA, reports WAFB, a CBS branch.
After asking Simpson, the police mentioned that this man had killed Wade with a fire weapon.
A $350,000 loan was established, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge's medical-legal parish office issued a preliminary report referring to the cause of death as a bullet wound in the head extending to the neck.
The department refers to that the co-operation of the action group of the State Police of Louisiana, the State Police's criminal laboratory, the Southern University police and residents of the area who cooperated in the investigation led to this detention.
LSU's athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the local authorities for their "diligence and effort to obtain justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
This advanced, with a height of 1.98 m, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Its average was 5.6 points and 2.6 points per game in the last season.
On Saturday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "damaged" and "cocked" by the death of Wade.
"This is what worries us forever," said Wade.
Vulcano casts in Mexico City
The Popocatepetl volcano has reached the suburbs south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention advised the Mexicans on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after a relapse of crater activity, which recorded 183 gas and zinc emissions in a 24-hour space.
The center detected numerous deaf and trembling noises.
Images on the social networks showed fine snow beds covering car para-brushes in Mexico City's neighborhoods as Xochimilco.
The geologists recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometres from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake destroyed the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Comparisons between the police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote by independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after encounters between independent protesters and the intervention police, while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizer referring catalon on the secession.
A group of mascarated separatists, worked by the intervention police, reached her with eggs and shot her in powder, creating dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
There were also later confrontations, in which the police took steps to deal with the conflicts.
For a few hours, independent groups singing "We don't forget, we don't forgive" faced protesters of the Union, who shouted "Long life for Spain".
Forty people have received treatment of minor injuries suffered in protests, can be read in the local press.
The tensions remain high in the region aimed at independence, one year after the reference of 1 October which was considered illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose the independence badly, although the influence on the urine had been low, with a majority of those against.
According to the Catholic authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to block the vote in the current polls broadcast by the region, resulting in violent confrontations.
Independent groups had been camped during the night on Saturday to prevent a demonstration of support to the national police.
Although this demonstration has been carried out, it has been forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electricist who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said there were no hope that Catalunha would become independent.
"In the past year, we have our best moments.
I saw my parents crying joyfully because they could vote, but now we are blocked," he said.
Despite having won a vital but tanning victory in the last December regional elections, the Catalan independent parties have had difficulties in maintaining the impasse this year, with their most known leaders in voluntary exile or in detention waiting for trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police with his cell phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders arrested for waiting for trial last year, announced that he would apply to the European Parliament in the next year's elections.
"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to report the regression of democratic values and the repression that we have witnessed by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after car shipment against a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car had repeatedly been attacked in a house in Londonderry.

At a certain point, someone may also have shot an animal against the car.
Menga attack gives a 1-0 victory to Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston assured victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, scared the Rangers and gave Steven Gerard the second win of only two in 18 games as a technical scientist at the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changes from level to level with the Hibernian in second place.
Gerarrd's team, which continues without a win outside home in the first division of this season, faces Hearts leaders with eight points in the next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will face the Rapid Vienna at home in the European Union on Friday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended its six games to its success without defeat in the division, with the Holt main coach without losing one time since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against entombed visitors
Holt's team should have made progress in the marker much before the goal, because the incisive character of its game was causing all kinds of problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson stepped into the defense, but he let himself pull in front of the ball and then Alan Lithgow managed only to direct his effort away after he had left to find Craig Halkett's head on the ball.
The team of the house was pleased to let the Rangers play before her, knowing that it could cause problems for visitors in the football games stopped.
And it was this way that the crucial hole emerged.
The Rangers granted a book and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson were coordinated to make the trip to Menga, which gave a touch and marked from the center of the big area.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the ball's possession, but he faced a defense from the impeccable house team, and the guards Liam Kelly had no major problems.
This pattern continued on the second part, although Alfredo Morelos had forced Kelly to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the foot of the Rangers guards, Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a touch away from another game of game in Livingston.
Crossings continued to come to the large area of Livingston, which were subsequently resolved, and two claims of great penalties, one after Halkett's investment on Glenn Middleton's replacement and the other after one hand, were rejected by the arbitrator.
Livingston Phenomenal Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, of BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to go beyond expectations in this ascending trajectory.
His game style and his staff little changed from his return to the great teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt in the way he has galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga maintained Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall gave his maximum throughout the game.
Whatever it is, Rangers revealed a little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality demonstrated at times with Gerard, the team remained very close to these standards.
Her final game was not inspired (only once they were able to open the team of the house), making it a kind of notice for the Rangers, which is located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is widely received in Colonia
There were surprises under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a small breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany, whose objective is to repair relations between NATO allies.
The difference involves issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Colonia to open a new and giant mix.
The city hosts the largest Turkish population outside its country.
The police called for security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters were immediately present to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard, condemning both the president's policies and the German government's decision to host him in the country.
Antagonical protests reflect the divisionist character of an acclaimed visitor as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing of the Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a street moved in Deptford, in the west of the city, about 10h15, a British summer time.
The travel driver stopped and an intervention relief team stopped, but the cyclist fell in place.
This collision takes place months after the death of another cyclist in a coliseum running on Children Street, about a mile and a half of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents are trying to identify the person and inform its family members.
Barriers and driveway were placed, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six injured agents in disturbances
Six prison officers were injured in disturbances in a high-security male prison, mentioned the Prison Cabinet.
The ongoing disturbances began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire about 09h30, British summer time on Saturday.
Special "Return" agents were called to solve the problem, which involves eight prisoners and is restricted to a branch.
The agents received treatment of small facial injuries in the area.
A spokesman for the Prison Services said: "Specially trained teams were used to resolve the ongoing incident at the Long Lartin HMP.
Six staff members received treatment of injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it must be clear that the names of the officials will be communicated to the police and these will be allowed to pass beyond the degrees."
The HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, intervention police officers were called to resolve a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with ballast balls.
Furacão Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the areas affected by drought may benefit)
It is rare a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but it is precisely what is expected for the beginning of next week, when the remaining energy of the Rosa hole goes through the South-West Desert, involving the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings of sudden flooding for the second and third days, for the southern and eastern regions of Nevada, for the south of California and for Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a direct trajectory about Phoenix on Wednesday, approaching the end of the afternoon with rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix referred to a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones kept a state of tropical storms or depression within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Centre of Furacons provide 5 to 10 mm precipitation, with isolated quantities that can reach 15 mm Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the South-West Desert, such as the Central Rochos Mountains and the Great Bacia, may receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of all isolated areas that can reach 10 mm.
For those who are not affected by the risks of sudden floods, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious concern, part of this precipitation can be beneficial, as the Southeast is currently affected by drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, slightly more than 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme dryness, the second most serious category," reported the weather.com site.
First of all, Rosa will reach the continent's mass crossing the peninsula of Baja California, Mexico.
The Rosa, still with force of fury on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coastal area in Mexico with tropical storms in the evening or at midnight.
There will be strong precipitation in parts of Mexico, which causes a significant risk of floods.
"Total precipitations are expected from 8 to 10 mm from the Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with maximum 25 mm possible", reported the weather.com site.
Rosa will then head north, traversing Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the first hours of the Wednesday morning as a tropical depression. This will then be heading south of Utah in the last hours of the Wednesday night.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remnants is the very high precipitation in the Netherlands California, in the northwest of Sonora, and in the South-West Desert of the United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains produce sudden and inundated floods of waste in the deserts, with life-threatening risks, and floods in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three adolescents of male sex and a 20-year-old man were arrested for alleged murder after a 16-year-old boy had been found with small arms wounds in Somerset.
The adolescent was found wounded in the area of Midsomer Norton’s Excelsior Terrace, about 4h00, at British summer time, on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains stable.
They were arrested during the night by a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old, and a 20-year-old man in Radstock area, contacted the police of Avon and Somerset.
The agents called on everyone who could have TV films from what happened.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "was the victim of malaria and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the impeccable and ultrasound tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump mentioned that Kavanaugh "was the victim of malaria and anger" of the Democratic Party during its appointment process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Friday, having rejected strongly and emotionally a charge of Christine Blasey Ford that she had been sexually abused for decades when they were both teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness in the hearing on his claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliantness, quality and courage" on that day.
"A vote of confirmation by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of confirmation of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum," said the majority of Western Virginia supporters.
The President later referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the Republican influence on Urnas in inter-salary elections.
"We are the five weeks of one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not competing, but I'm actually competing," he said.
"That's why I'm going all the way to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than six-to-one, a major helper to the CNN of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of deaths in soil and tsunamis in Indonesia; the number continues to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them were dragged by giant waves that reached the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami reached the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities communicated on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Saturday, when waves of up to six meters of height were embroiled in the beach when they arrived, dragging many to death and causing a piece of destruction on their way.
The tsunami occurred following a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the Tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not run immediately, having been victims of what happened," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency to minimize the effect of the disasters in Indonesia (BNPB) in a communication in Jacarta.
"The tsunami didn't move alone: it dragged cars, trucks, houses, reached everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at 800 km/h before reaching the coastal line.
Some people took the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated for 24 centers in Palu.
The public air photographs by the agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, deformed bridges and collapsed, and a nearby pool of water.
The coastal city continued to be flooded by replications on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) referred to a statement that the energy released by the huge six-day wave was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb spread over Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have broadened the size of the tsunami, read in the statement.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and referred to thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels.
There were bodies of some victims imprisoned under the roofs of the damaged buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho pointed out that the number of victims and damages can be deeper along the coastal line 300 km north of Palu, an area named Doghía, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely incapacitated and there was no information" about Donghaa, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 residents in the area," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could worsen a lot more," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticised for not reporting that a tsunami had reached Palu, although the authorities had stated that waves emerged at the time the notice was issued.
In a loving film published on social networks, you can see a man on the top floor of a building shouting spontaneous warnings that the tsunami was approaching, for the people on the street below.
In a few minutes, a water wall collapsed on the coast, pulling buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the film.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive cut in energy which interrupted communications in the Palu area, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo aircraft with Jacarta and other cities. However, the evacuated still desperately need food and other basic products.
The city airport was only opened for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo made a visit to the Palau evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of deaths in Tsunami in Indonesia is growing exponentially for more than 800.
It's so bad.
Although it has been safe to arrive in the city of Palu, where staff are located in wooden floors mounted on the patio of their offices, the staff of the World Vision of Doghea crossed destruction scenes on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"Tell me they've seen lots of destroyed houses," he said.
It's so bad.
Even when relief groups began to begin providing assistance to the victims of the disaster, some complained that the most experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulation, funding, supplies and foreign personnel may only have access to the site if it is declared "national disaster zone".
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still at a level of provincial disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says "OK, this is a national disaster," we can open the doors to international assistance, but this status does not yet exist."
On the second night in Palu after the quake and six-day tsunami, friends and family of the still missing kept the hope that their loved ones would become part of the miracles that struck the shadows of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from an esote.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been taken into the caves for two days beside the mother's body.
Gendon Subandon, coach of the Indonesian national team of parapente, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, completed at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at Hotel Roa Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandji, were his students.
"As a senior parapet practitioner, I have to load my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon said that, in the hours following the news of Hotel Roa Roa's disappearance, he had begun to circle between the parapence community, sending messages to whatsApp for the sportsmen of Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, their messages produced only a dozen verification marks, rather than a pair of blues.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Ladrons carry 26 750 USD during the automatic re-loading of the box on Newport on the Levee
On the sixth of the morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's officer who was refurbishing an automatic box at Newport on the Levee, according to a statement by the Department of Newport Police.
The driver of the car was evaluating an automatic box in the complex of variations and preparing to introduce more money, according to Detective Dennis McCarthy in the communiqué.
While he was busy, another man "proceeded to run behind the Brink's officer" and stole a bag of money that was intended for a delivery.
Witnesses came across several suspects running from the area, according to the communiqué, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Those who have information about their identities should contact Newport's police through number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes your name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name--to Ye.
When he announced this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "O being previously known by Kanye West."
At 41 years of age, West received some of Ye's and used it as the title of his eight album, released in June.
The change comes before your participation in Saturday Night Live, where you are expected to present your new Yandhi album.
This intervention is intended to replace the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled it for "emotional reasons", informed the performer.
At the same time being abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I think "ye" is the most common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible means "you," said West at the beginning of this year, when he commented on the title of his album next to the Big Boy radio presenter.
"At least I am you, I am us, we are us.
Come from Kanye, which means "the only one" for only Yes - being just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was alternately known by Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference by the names Love and Brother Love.
An old West co-laborator, JAY-Z, also used variations of its name with or without hyphens and majors.
In Mexico, AMLO is committed to not resorting to the military against civilians
The elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel López Obrador committed himself not to use military force against civilians, as soon as the country was approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to force the Mexican people."
Soldiers fired against a peaceful demonstration at the stage on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that may have risen to 300, when leftist student movements were implanted throughout Latin America.
López Obrador committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those studying and opening up more public universities.
The President said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities arrest young people for criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
At a time when China strengthens its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its research costs in this area, said the investor and professional in the Kai-Fu Lee area, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments occur after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements related to IA, although the country does not have a comprehensive formal strategy on the subject.
However, China presented its plan last year: it intends to lead innovation in IA by 2030.
"Dublining the IA research budget would be a good start, as all other countries are so behind the US and we are looking for a new IA revolution," said Lee.
Double funding may double the chances of the next major success of IA being achieved by the United States, Lee referred to the NCB in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested one of the most prominent IA companies in China, the Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked in an IA system that defeated Othello's best-class American player. Later, he performed executive functions in Microsoft Research and was president of the Google branch in China.
Lee gave credit to the previous US government technological competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Department of Defence for Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when it would be next, in order to help identify the next viewers.
U.S. researchers often have to make a great effort to obtain state funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that is stealing academic leaders; it's companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired university-based lighthouses to work in IA.
Lee mentioned that changes in immigration policies could also help the US to push its efforts towards IA.
"I am of the opinion that green cards should be granted automatically to doctors in IA," he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of the Next Generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way as used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to finance researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve partners in industry and the academic environment, and the White House announced the formation of the Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion this month in an AI Next initiative.
With regard to NSF, it currently invests more than US$100 million per year in IA research.
However, the legislation of the United States which seeks to establish a National Committee for Artificial Intelligence has not been in progress for months.
Macedonians vote in reference to the change in the name of the country
The Macedonians were voting on Sunday to decide on the change in the name of the country to "Northern Republic of Macedonia" an initiative that would resolve a decades-long debate with Greece which blocked their applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which integrates a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory and saw its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on a new name proposal, but nationalists argue that change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population, mostly slaves.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the influence on the urine would be sufficient to meet 50% of the requirements for the referendum to be valid.
The question raised by the rapporteur was: "Is it in favour of entering the NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying to continue the admission efforts of EU and NATO agencies to Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come to vote today for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old in Skopje.
Although the reference is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament stated that it would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a majority of two-thirds in Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission stated that there had not been irregular records until one afternoon.
However, the inflation was only 16%, compared with 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters attended the vote.
"We voted for my children; our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, a capital elector, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum on the change in the name of the country, which would open the doors for their accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepared a small hall and placed chairs in front of the tents set up by those who would vote for the referendum.
"We are by NATO and by the EU, but we want to join the head, not by the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we don't want to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn ourselves to others like China and Russia to become part of the Eureka integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO entry will bring very much needed investments to Macedonia, which accounts for a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
According to him, a "yes" would be "confirmation of our future".
A survey published on the second day by the Macedonian Political Investigation Institute revealed that between 30 and 43% of the voters would participate in the referendum, less than the necessary influence.
Another survey, conducted by the Macedonian TV Telma, found that 57% of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70% of those said they would vote yes.
In order for the reference to be successful, the afluence must be more than 50% more than one vote.
The failure of this report would represent the first important wish in the pro- western government's policy since it took place in May last year.
See: Sergeio Aguero of Manchester City across all the defense of Brighton towards the golo
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling forced Brighton's defense in the victory for 2-0 against Manchester City on Saturday, Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
I'll make it look ridiculously easy in your throat at the 65th minute.
The Argentinian advance received a walk in the middle field at the beginning of the game.
He made a sprint between three Brighton defenses before cutting to reach open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He set up a defense before neutralising the race and others at the limits of the great area of Brighton.
So he took a walk to his left, where he was Sterling.
The advanced English used its first touch in the big area to return the ball to Aguero, which, with the right button, defeated Brighton Matthew Ryan's straight guard with an end to the right side of the network.
"Aguero is arguing with some problems on his feet," said Pep Guardiola, a city trainer.
"We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky for him to have marked a hole at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage against the Premier League.
That hole was marked at 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball well in Brighton's territory in this game.
He took a step over the defenses along the left side of Leroy Sane.
This gave some touch before leading Sterling towards the second route.
Sky Blues' progress dropped the ball to the network immediately before it landed outside the field borders.
The City faces Hopeneheim in the season of the League of Championships at 12:55 p.m. on Wednesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make life difficult for Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the end, there were not many reasons to force another beginning.
However, the always competitive Scherzer has hopes of entering the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but there are only implications for the final Rockies, which hold a leadership of a game on Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies had at least luck with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Saturday night, but they still intend to secure their title from the first division.
"Although we are playing for nothing, at least we can go into the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the maximum level I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete under these conditions?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the title launcher for Sunday, but someone says they are inclined to allow Scherzer to effect the launchs in this situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, held a meeting in the Bullpen on Friday and would launch in his normal position on Sunday.
The right player from Washington goes with 18-7, with an ERA of 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries at this time.
Trump is starting in West Virginia.
The President later referred to the situation involving his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while referring to the importance of republican influence in inter-salary elections.
"All we did is in play in November.
We are the five weeks of one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the great, great... I'm not competing, but I'm competing, and that's why I'm everywhere fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You're seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you're seeing it happen right now.
And they're determined to recover power by using all the necessary means.
They don't care about who they are, who they have to go up to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we won't give them."
Democrats, he mentioned, have the mission of "resisting and obstructing".
"And they've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "aggressive, evil, sad and false."
The President referred to the name Diane Feinstein, a member of the Senate's Judicial Committee, having received sound from the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you run away from the document?
Well, then, isn’t it?
No, um, I hope that one--that was a body language even worse--the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party has ceased to be inclusive.
It's intolerant for those who open up their opinion
When the activists of the Momentum of my local sports organization voted to censor me, it didn't surprise me.
At the end of the accounts, I am the latest of a series of working Members in Parliament who were told that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was subjected to a similar treatment because he faced anti-Semitism firmly.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for arguing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues with respect to which Jeremy discussed with previous leaders.
The report for the Working Meeting of Nottingham East on the sixth-party mentioned that "we claim that meetings are inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local worker in Parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, he has ceased to be the host of many of the meetings and the promise of "more kind and kind" policy has been very forgotten, although it has sometimes been concrete.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged whether or not the party's leadership is acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, because the colleagues he thought shared a similar political perspective began to expect me a turnaround and to take positions with which he would never agree - whether they were on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn't really matter what I say), there is a torrent of abuse on the social networks that call for "missing", accusing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not belong to the Labour Party.
And it's not just me who's going through this.
In fact, I know I have more luck than some of my fellow Members, because the comments that are addressed to me tend to be political.
I am afraid of professionalism and the determination of these colleagues who face a range of gender-based or racist abuses every day, but who never come back before them.
One of the most disillusive aspects of this policy era is how these levels of abuse have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn stated last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we stopped being inclusive, and with each motion of "censorship" or changing the rules of selection, the party narrows its eyes.
I have received numerous advice over the past two years, urging me to keep my head down, so that I may not be so expressive, and thus "it would be all right" for me.
But it wasn't about what I came to do.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, forced by the neglect of the government of Thatcher who left my school classroom literally covered in tears, I have sought to fight for better public services for those they most need, whether as an author or as a minister in the government.
I have never hidden my policies, including the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been somewhat confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the movement on Saturday morning, all I have to say is that when the country goes to a Brexit that will damage families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Nottingham Momentum; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of "missing" or political envoys will prevent me from acting in the sense of what I believe to be the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: from Ayr’s exile to the top
Two late trials sent the result in some way, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to triumph in this incorrigibly interesting game of the Tennt's Premiership of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of the ten no hits.
In the end, it was a higher defense and a better risk management that made the house team take the best, and coach Peter Murchie had all the reasons for being satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and we continue to be immaturous, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The merit goes to Ayr. They're better at risk than we are."
Grant Anderson's test at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but a yellow card for the Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, awarded for the game by the Warriors, enabled Melrose to express the numbers, having Jason Baggot took advantage of an unconverted test.
Climate has extended Ayr's advantage with a great penalty, before, immediately before mid-term, has marked and then turned a solo test to place the mark on 17-5 for Ayr at the interval.
However, Melrose began well on the second part and Patrick Anderson's test, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
It was followed by a long interruption due to a serious injury by Ruarahh Knott, which was transported from maca to the outside and, after the start, Ayr reinforced leadership with a test by Stafford McDowell converted by Climate.
Captain of Ayr in exercise, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the digital advantage with an unconverted experiment by Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense investment of pressure.
However, the team of the house returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for breaking the air without the ball, at the launch of the penalty, MacPherson put the ball in the ground behind the lead in the progress of the Ayr.
Climo turned, as he had done almost immediately after the renaissance, after Kyle Rowe had collected David Armstrong's kick box and sent Gregor Henry to the fifth test of the house team.
Still Game Star is ready for a new career in the restoration business
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, seems ready to enter the restoration sector after knowing that he was appointed director of a licensed restoration company.
The 56-year-old actor represents Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which writes and participates with the long-term eating partner Greg Hemphil.
The couple announced that the ninth season, soon starring, will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of the Aposymorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to get involved in the "floating business of Glasgow restoration".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a land that is not provided by the coast, expects the court to reopen its way to the Pacific
Marine pilots patrol a ship covered with cordame in La Paz.
Public buildings provide a blue and brown flag.
The ships of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon bear the phrase: "The sea is ours by right.
It's a duty to get him back."
Throughout Bolivia, a country without border, the memory of a lost coastal line for Chile is still alive in a bloody conflict by resources in the 19th century, as well as the desire to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be at the top of the decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a hearing by the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the impetence, a spirit of unity and seriousness and, of course, a positive outlook on the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will assist in the provision of the TIJ's judgment on giant screens scattered by the country, hoping that the Hague Court will issue a ruling in favour of its country's claim, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be obliged to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here Morales, the Bolivian indigenous charismatic president, who faces a controversial battle for the next year's reelection, also has a lot in play in the court's judgment on Tuesday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," were the president's votes last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that it would not even change in case otherwise.
The United Nations body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chile to another country and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the TIJ judgment was delivered only six months after the hearing of the final claims indicated that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist at international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have damaged it.
"The issue of sea access was kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
The brilliant rhetoric of Morales has lost some good residual interest in Chile, he suggested.
At some point in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to keep the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not been embassies since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in Haia, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was indiscriminately slow.
The next Tuesday will give Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a possibility "to end 139 years of mutual benefit disputes", he said.
Calzadilla also admitted that Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political mullet.
"Bolivia will never be deprived of its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to understand that we have to go beyond the past."
North Korea says there will be no disarmament without the country trusting in the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his nation would never shrink from its nuclear weapons if it did not trust Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfill the promises they had made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments arise when U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to resume nuclear diplomacy in the first place, more than three months after Singapore's summit with North-Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri pointed out that it is an "impossible dream" to consider that US continued sanctions and objection to a declaration which puts an end to the war in Korea will sometimes lead the North to join itself.
Washington intends to accept the statement without having Pyongyang taking first significant steps in terms of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a generalized cetistism about Pyongyang really intends to reduce an arsenal that the country is still likely to be the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo was planning to visit Pyongyang in the month that came to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion dispersions in Paris reveal the most recent line of huge chapters along the way of a store near it
If you intend to extend your collection of hats or totally protect yourself from the sun, you do not need to look for more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented in the past a series of extraordinary and oversized chapters for their spring- Summer 2019 collections, which left the style set in Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very few practical chapters and these designers sent these frightening creatures to the past.
The most prominent part of Valentino was an extravagant beige hat decorated with a wide bead similar to a punishment that washed the head of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled melancholys, a fetish hat and even ananas, although the same has not been designed to keep the hot head.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of weird masks... even at the time of the caravan.
Many of the colorful masks had hair covered and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than with a high suit.
One of the creations looked like the seaming equipment, with tubes and glasses, while another looked like a frozen ice-cream.
And if you want to continue this huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
The observatories of style provide that these huge chapters are on the way from a store near you.
Oversized chapters appear to be effective in the "La Bomba", the pala hat with a down 61 cm that has been used by all people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand of worship behind the very little practical hat that spread through the social networks sent another great creation for the passageways: a beach bag in the palm almost as large as the model in the fact that it carried it.
The Rafia bag of burning oranges, decorated with ruffs and with a white leather strap, was the most prominent part of the 2019 spring-vera-La Riviera collection of Jacquemus in Paris Fashion Week.
The famous estillelist Luke Armitage said to the FEMAIL: "I am waiting to see great chapters and beach bags coming to the shops for the next summer. Since the designer had so much impact, it would be difficult to ignore the search for oversized accessories."
John Edward: linguistic competences are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland benefit from a course of academic excellence, with this trend continued in 2018 with a set of exceptional results in exams, strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students scattered throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are working to get the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools intend to prepare their students for deepening their studies and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place among global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a school curriculum as far as possible, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If we talk to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can enter into his heart."
This quote well reminds us that we cannot rely only on English when we intend to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of recent studies this year, we verify that the languages are at the top of the tables, with the highest rates of use for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students studying foreign languages reached the maximum A classification.
These data, collected in 74 schools under SCIS, showed that 72% of students obtained the maximum A in mandarim, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
Such evidence shows that Scottish independent schools are promoting foreign languages as vital skills that will inevitably serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now addressed in the same way that STEM topics (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the courses of independent schools and not only themselves.
A United Kingdom Employment and Competitiveness Commission survey in 2014 concluded that, among the reasons for the difficulty of employers in filling vacancies, 17% said about the lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential employment opportunities to require knowledge of languages, these powers are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if they have learned a second language, they will have a tangible advantage in the future with an aptitude for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically place a multilingual person in front of competition.
According to a YouTube survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language enough to keep a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a proportion of two digits, 15%.
So investing now in language learning is important for today's children.
The field of various languages, especially those in developing countries, will give children the best chance of finding a job with relevance.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach the most important languages for the United Kingdom for the 2020 horizon, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose in independent schools, supported by trained staff specialized in the area.
Independent Scottish schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need for success, whatever their future.
It is unlikely that today, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the country's future. Therefore, it is necessary to reflect it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "optimals of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to make this option available with diversity and excellence for young Scottish people.
You have to do it.

LeBron begins at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting is ending for the fans who want to see LeBron James start in Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, a Lakers trainer, announced that James will be involved in the opening game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes will you play still to determine.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell published a tweet saying that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After the trainings at the beginning of this week, James was investigated on his plans for the calendar of six Lakers games in pre-time.
"I don't need pre-time games in this phase of my career to be ready," he said.
Time and channel of YouTube from Trump's beginning in West Virginia
President Donald Trump starts a round of campaign start tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five events scheduled for the next week, which include parades in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote waiting for its election for the Supreme Court's vacancy, Trump intends to strengthen support for the intercalculation elections to be held soon, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is the start of Trump in West Virginia tonight and how can you see it online?
The beginning of Trump in Wheeling, in West Virginia, is marked for the 7th afternoon, East Time, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You will be able to attend the start of Trump in West Virginia online below in live via YouTube.
Trump will probably address the hearings this week to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed for the Supreme Court, who have become tense because of allegations of sexual abuse. The confirmation vote in the Senate will be held for one week while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main objective of this start-up torrent is to help the Republicans, who face difficult elections in November, to gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign officials said that these five commissions in the coming week are "to give energy to volunteers and supporters at a time when the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority that remain in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so fundamental to the president's agenda that it will visit as many states as possible, as we approach the agitating of the campaign period," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign that has given up being mentioned, told Reuters.
Marked for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the logo at night can attract supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage of the media in the Pittsburgh area", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which it won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, in disservice in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and help him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team shows that it has forces to fight to keep the hope alive before Sunday's singles
After three uniform sessions, Saturday morning exercise can be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum oscillation is a completely invented sport concept, but it is one in which players really believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where did they say the empire would come now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now there are four, so we're dealing with it like a little push," Jordan Spieth said while he was out of the field at the end of the day.
Europe is in advantage, of course, with four points ahead and with more than twelve in the game.
The Americans, as Spieth says, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each got three points in four.
Spieth has been the killer of tea to green and is leading by example.
Those party guitar screams were becoming higher than the round continued, with a crucial punch that made the fourth game an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind two.
His who won the game on the 15th produced a similar cry, so that he shows that he still believes that the American team continues to compete.
"It is only necessary that we concentrate and worry about our own game," said Spieth.
That's all the rest of each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of Ryder Cup.
The European pair, which is unlikely but worshipable, is four to four and cannot make mistakes.
The "Moliwood" was the only duty not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and on the back snow of Saturday morning.
In this series, and given the form of its energy seems to flow from and for this turbulent crowd, it is reinforced by the idea that they are players to beat on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to seal a European winning potential for the por-do-sol in Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
In preference, both at the same time in different holes.
However, the debate on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs this morning, when he was on team with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front of the nose encased Spanish and Swedish in a hole that they were never ready to leave.
However, on Sunday, there's no one to help them get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see from close due to the interactions between partners, the advice they give or not and how the strategy can change instantly.
Europe has played better on a team so far and has gained a significant advantage on the last day. However, this forum has also shown that the US team has the stigma for fighting that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe with 10-6 leadership on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the last day of Ryder Cup with an advantage after leaving the Fourballs and Foursomes of the Saturday Games with a 10-6 leader in front of the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulties in reaching the classification in Le Golf National, up to now, of four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, fighting to preserve the trophie that was lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that failed in the fourballs of the morning, winning the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance to two winning matches, but they failed to reduce the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points on Sundays 12 to keep the trophie.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points followed when he and Molinari, who received some of "Molliwood", after a week of sensuality, are the only due to win four points in their four opening games in the history of Ryder Cup.
Having swallowed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superseded the advantage, defeating a Woods without energy and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with another more fascinating 5&4.
Woods, who was arrested for two games on Saturday, revealed occasional sex access, but he already lost 19 of the games he argued in fourballs and foursomes, and seven followed.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third ranked in the world ranking.
However, on this pleasant day with a slight break to the west of Paris, Europe has not always brought the best.
Jordan Spieth, winner for three times of the main male tournaments, and Justin Thomas defined the reference to Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duet gained a brave victory of 2&1 on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, from Spain, and later returned to win Poulter and Rory McIllroy by 4&3 on the fours, losing both opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history a team has reversed a four-point disadvantage before the singles, although Furyk's team, the holder of the title, just needs to empathize to keep the trophie.
After two days in second position, an attack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says "no thought" to a unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was building up confidence in the United States and that it was not possible for the country to unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Agency that North Korea had taken "significant good-will measures" last year, such as the interruption of nuclear and missile tests, the decommissioning of the nuclear testing centre and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we see no corresponding answer from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there will be no way to proceed to our first disarmament."
Although Ri has recycled North Korean complaints already known about Washington's resistance to a "failed" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as steps would be taken, its declarations appear to be significant as long as they do not necessarily reject unilateral denuclearization, in contrast with the previous Pyongyang positions.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit held between a US president in exercise and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim committed himself to working in the sense of "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump offered security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has sought to bring an end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States claims that Pyongyang has first left his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "first nuclearization" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coherent manner, opposing until the "declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can put us in trouble is an impossible dream for people who don't know anything about us.
The problem is, however, that the extension of sanctions is deepening our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the U.S. leaders in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If South Korea was interested in this issue and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to this impasse."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year when he said to the General Assembly of the United Nations to guide North Korea's rockets towards the US territory was inevitable after "Mr. Mau" Trump had called Kim "the man of the rockets" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which had threatened to "disappear completely" North Korea last year, commended Kim for her courage to take steps in terms of disarmament, but stated that there was much to be done and that sanctions would continue until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Thursday, Trump stated that he did not have a calendar for this, referring to "if you stay two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Friday: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be strong until the denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable".
The Security Council unanimously reinforced the sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006, in an attempt to extradite the financing of North Korea's nuclear programmes and ballistic missions.
Pompeo met Ri along with the United Nations General Assembly and then declared that he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit didn't work well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, although after North Korea accused him of "making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to disbanding a mission and also a nuclear complex if the United States "takes appropriate measures".
Pompeo stated that Kim had told him that the "relevant measures" they sought were security guarantees taken by Trump in Singapore, as well as initiatives in the normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course that teaches them to rest up enough
A new course at Harvard University this year placed all its students to sleep more, in an initiative to combat the machinist culture of studying in "directs" impregnated with caffeine.
One professor concluded that students of this university at the top of the world ranking did not often have the slightest idea about the most basic concepts of care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, who believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for the course emerged after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At last, a girl came up with me and said, "Why are you just saying this to me in the last year of the course?"
The young man said that no one had ever mentioned the importance of sleep, which surprised me," said The Telegraph.
The course, which was served for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to the improvement of general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, stated that the institution decided to introduce the course after it had concluded that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course of an hour includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom where students click on coffee cups, cortinas, salads and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficit, and the importance of a routine to gather to bed.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of AVC, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the fields, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think in their daily routines.
"We know that students' behaviour will not change instantly.
However, we believe they have the right to know, as all of us have the right to know the health effects of the option of smoking," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in "directing" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students make this a growing problem.
To ensure that we sleep well and qualityly should be a "secret weapon" of the students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid confusion, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a way of hunger, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his studies last year in Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the whole campus, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all postgraduate students to attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended to students that they measure the use of an alarm for the time of going to bed, as it is to agree, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can rule off the circus rhythm and lead to problems in sleeping.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Men's Golo de Menga derruba de Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another sadness out of the house when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerard's disarmed team a 1-0 defeat at the Livingston stadium.
Ibrox's team was trying to record its first victory on its way from the triumph by 1-0 in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team had just attacked Gerarrd's second defeat in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the dismissed Hearts, leader of the first Scottish division.
Menga marked seven minutes before the end of the first part and the collection of Rangers, without inspiration, never seemed equal power.
With the Rangers now down to the sixth position, Livingston climbs up to the third, and only behind the Hibernian by the difference of throats.
And there may be more problems for Rangers after the Calum Spence line tax has been treated by an infection on the head caused by an object apparently attracted from the visitor's area.
Gerarrd made eight changes in the team that crossed Ayr in the middle of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, by his side, used the 11th of Livingston who stole a point at Hearts last week, and will have been thrilled in the way his well-wounded team put the opponents in each game.
Rangers may have dominated the ball's possession, but Livingston did more than he had.
The team could have marked after two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's ballistics, but the average lost his great chance to go out.
A long-standing Keaghan Jacobs free spot was at the meeting of Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to finish out in the direction of the second route.
Rangers was able to recover control, but hope was greater than faith in their game at the end of the third.
Of course Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been given a great sentence for a quarter of an hour with his coliition with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian appeals.
The Rangers got only two finals at the first part, but the old guard-directed by Ibrox Liam Kelly had little to worry about Lassana Coulibary's head end and Ovie Ejaria's weak end.
Although Livingston's goal at 34 minutes may have been contrary to what was expected of the development of the game, it is unlikely that the team deserved it, no longer because of its tenacity.
Once again, Rangers couldn't deal with a football game that stopped away from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher took a step towards Scott Robinson, who kept calm when he chose Menga for a simple finalization.
Gerarrd moved at the interval, having replaced Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost had an impact when the lateral advance passed to Morelos, but the impressioner Kelly made a sprint from his line to make the block.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett to take a long time after a long walk.
Holt's team may have increased its advantage in the final stages, but McGregor managed well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow finished out in the corner.
The replacement of Rangers, Glenn Middleton, once again complained of a great penalty when he was brought up in Jacobs, but Thomson ignored the request again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger accountant
And now a page from our German "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years old and continues to CONTAR ... was born in Germany the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that was just brought to the device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Count Geiger has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the unlikely vacuum scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like a uranium.
When we put these auriculars, we can even hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans said, "Look, now you're really screaming!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd anniversary.
But the invention he gave his name is still missing.
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its modification to the laboratory.
These cells, which can "see" a common protein to many cancers, are then re-injected into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a series of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her cancer in the ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its modification into the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein to many cancers named by HER2. These cells are then re-injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancer", including the mothers, the ovaries, the lungs and also the colorretites, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach involving removing immune cells from patients and "instructing them" to attack cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West ships in a support diaspora to Trump carrying a MAGA hat after its appearance in SNL.
It didn't work out well.
Kanye West was studied on Saturday Night Live after an inconsistencies in which U.S. president Donald Trump praised him, saying he would apply for presidential elections in 2020.
After performing his night song, named Ghost Town, where he wore a "Make America Great" chapter, he started a joke against the Democrats and reiterated his support to Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white guy and he says to me, 'How can you like Trump? He's racist!'
Well, if I were worried about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, where Hollywood star broke the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate's Trial Committee on allegations of sexual aggression by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been transmitted, the West Bravata scene was published on social networks by eating Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to get rid of West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that there had been a bad speech in the boots because of the hat.
"They scared me in the boots.
They said, "You're not going there with this hat."
I'm scared!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see marginalization?" saying "I put my cup of super-man, because that means nobody tells me what to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Try love."
His comments caused public movements and SNL participants appeared to be embarrassed, reported Variety, having someone from the program said to the newspaper: "The whole study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with the execution of the song I Love it dissipated from Perrier's throat.
West received a statement of support from the director of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who published the tweet: "To one of our most courageous spirits: OBJECTED BY ENFRENTERS THE TURBA".
However, the interviewer Karen Hunter published a tweet saying that West was simply "to be what it is, and that is absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by understanding your music or by supporting your "art") who I think is getting along and promoting harmful ideology for the community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, claiming that it was now "to be known by Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to rename, following the past of Didy, also known by Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
Snoop Dog also used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist previously known by Prince".
Allegedly attempted murder after excavating in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was exaggerated in a restaurant in the eastern area of Belfast on Saturday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackmore, the police said.
It is expected that the hearing will be presented by the Belfast Tribunal on Tuesday.
The charges will be analysed by the public ministry.
Battle Star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role as an esprimist like Jon Snow in the violent series of medieval fantasy by HBO, War of the Thrones.
However, at the age of 31, the actor attacked the stereotype of the magical hero, claiming that such roles on the screen make girls feel often that they have to be hard to be respected.
In a conversation with Sunday Times Culture, Kit referred to believing that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who has recently been with his colleague in the Rose Leslie Tronos War, also 31 years old, admitted that he has a "very strong position" about addressing the problem.
"I have a very strong personal position at this time: what happened wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What are we going to teach men when they're growing in terms of the problem we're seeing?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
And he went on, "What is inato and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel that they must belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the great issues of our time: how can we change this?
Because obviously something went very bad for the young."
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any pre-wars or similars of the Tron War when the series ended in the next summer, referring to him that the "fighting fields and horses" ended.
From November, Kit will participate in a real West edition of Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Trons War.
"I know my wife in this series, so she somehow gave me my future family and my life here before," he said.
Rose played Ygrite's role, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in a series of galarized fantasy with Emmys.
The wedding gave the bride in June 2018 in the fields of Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China announced a 14% drop in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of the new cases are broadcast through sexual relations, which marks a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was virtually zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Studies have estimated that, due to the country's conservative values, 70 to 90% of men who had sexual relations with other men ended up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases result from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
The Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine since 2003 as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters has just escaped information about Republican senators by one of his collaborators and attacks "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
The US Congressman Maxine Waters dismissed on Saturday the allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information from three members of the US Senate on the pages of Wikipedia of the legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles stated that the charges were promoted by leaders of opinion and websites of "Oldright".
"Deceptions, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published includes rightly the residences of the homes and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Friday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during an audition with a Senate panel on sexual misconduct charges against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed for the Supreme Court.
The flight of information occurred some time after the three senators have asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of publications was associated with the Waters Office and published the data of a member of Waters' staff, reported The Hill.
"This unfounded charge is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false claims, had no responsibility for this escape of information.
This unfounded charge is completely false and absolutely false."
The Waters statement quickly attracted criticism online, including those of the former press secretary of Casa Blanca Ari Fleischer.
"This nonsense is cholera," Fleischer wrote.
"That suggests she doesn't have the temper to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something that is not his responsibility, he cannot remain a chore.
You can't have a challenging position.
You can't ask the prosecutor's reasons.
You have to reveal peace and seriousness."
Fleischer appeared to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of being too cholera during the Friday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will discuss the place of Waters in the intercalculation elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," he read on his tweet.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had warned "the competent authorities" of these fraudulent allegations.
"We ensure that the guilty will be revealed," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff."
Critic of Johnny English Back to Attack - fail spy film parody with Rowan Atkinson
It's now a way to get to know Brexit in any new film with a British taste, and this seems to apply to the new edition in the series of comedy films and actions Johnny English, started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Regression of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-sacrifice on the subject of being so bad is the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes ripped apart and an overly elastic expression obtained his license to create confusion, renewed once again - with his name signaling, more than anything, that is a comprehensive comical creation for non-englophone cinemas.
He is, of course, an idiot's secret agent who, despite his strange claims to a soft glamour, has a bit of Cloiseau, a bit of Mr. Bean's pie and something from that volcano that has only contributed to the theme of the film "Times of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
In addition, its character was originally based on the traveler and an international mysterious man whose role Atkinson played in TV ads for Barclaycard, which left the chaos on his way.
There are one or two interesting moments in this recent edition of JE.
I love the scene where Johnny English approaches a helicopter carrying a medium armor, with the rotor legs making a short ride against the capacit.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is obvious, but humor alone is weak and surprisingly superfluous, especially since "serious" films such as 007 and Missions are now confidently proposing comedy as an ingredient.
We have the idea that humor is directed to children and not adults and, in my opinion, the strange adventures of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as the film numbers of Atkinson in the character of Bean.
Now, the premise, always present, is that Great Britain is lying in a grave mess.
A computer pirate infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to suppress the service agent, a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop for a prime minister who's wearing a posing and conflicting figure, suffering already a total failure of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives his best with this role that reminds him of Theresa May's character, but the argument does not provide much material for large flights.
Her secret service consultants inform her that, since all agents in the asset have been committed, there will be a need to get someone out of the reform.
And this is Johnny English's disaster, now working as a teacher in a small school, but giving non-official lessons about how to be an infiltrated spy: there are some interesting numbers here, because English offers us an exhibition studio in the style of the film "Rock School".
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and reunite with his assistant Bough, paper re-enacted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, attracted to a submarine commander, an exciting character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin of the disaster at His Majesty's Secret Service are back to action, facing the beautiful dead woman Ophelia Bulletova, a role played by Olga Kurylenko.
However, the prime minister is being dangerously affected by the billionaire charisma of technology that claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: left Jason Volta, performed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their obsession with absurd acts of destruction: disillusioned by staff of the table, burned a French restaurant view, created confusion as clandestine in the luxurious iate of Volta, and English invented clean anarchy as he tried to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the inside of the Volta house.
All paradigms were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but because of the most sympathetic and time-consuming, the whole has enough TV for children.
The result is quite medium.
And like Johnny English's other films, I couldn't stop teaching: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes his talent fair?
Laborists predict that they are launching a plan for the British to work four days a week, but receiving five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party may be weighing a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day work week, but with five days paid.
Reports suggest that the party wants employers to pass the savings with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) for workers, giving them an additional day of footing.
The workers got a weekend of three days, but keeping the order.
Source points out that the idea of "adjustment" to the party's economic programme, which focuses on the country for the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day work week received the favorable opinion of the Syndicate Congress as a form of workers took part in economic changes.
A senior official of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "We hope to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
"It won't happen one day for the other, but a four-day work week is an effort adapted to the approach of the party to the economic balance for the worker, as well as the overall strategy of the party for the industrial sector."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party had already proposed a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this ambition is not favored at this time by the entire Labour Party.
A party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not part of the party's policy and we are not considering it."
The shadow finance minister John McDonnell used the conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
McDonnell stated that he was determined to recover the power from the hands of "faceless directors" and "speculators" of basic services companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the total share of current water business shareholders, as the Labour Party may make "deductions" based on the perception of illegal conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to place workers in corporate management councils and to create inclusive equity funds that transfer 10% of the private companies' share to officials, which can pay annual dividends that can go up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" if the FBI research in Kavanaugh can do them or not change ideas
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote of its appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, raising questions as to whether the conclusions could lead to Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be delivered on Sunday, the "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would change their mind.
Kennedy showed himself more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"Tell me when I go to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened when this claim appeared and I asked him, "Have you done it"?
He was resolved, determined, inexhaustible."
Graham's vote, however, seems irrevocable.
"I've decided about Brett Kavanaugh and I would need an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett did a powerful defeat," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all those she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I can't see anything change again."
What's Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a list of extremely impressive stars that will also act on an impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
Already in its seventh year, Global Citizen Festival will host tens of thousands of people in the Central Park's Great Revado, not only to attend events such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness for the truth of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a defence group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as voluntary, sending an e-mail to a world leader, a phone call or any other significant ways to increase awareness for the purpose of ending poverty.
But what was the degree of success of Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of "clickivism" - do we find it different to sign an online request or send a tweet?
Global Citizen states that since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" have been registered by its supporters who have been under pressure in order to achieve a number of different objectives.
These actions, according to the organization, have contributed to the announcement by world leaders of commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, having at least $10 billion relating to the same has already been paid or pledged.
The group estimates that the funds received have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people scattered around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the United Kingdom with investors and implementing partners committed to "help children reach their full potential", which promised to give Rwanda $35 million in order to help put an end to undernutrition in the country. This has been received after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, the donors, the national governments and the Global Citizens as all of us, we can become the social injustice of undernutrition a note of history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that after more than 5,000 press actions on the United Kingdom in order to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with interventions at the level of nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the site, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answers: "It was a long and painful path - sometimes we fell and failed.
But, like the great movements by civil rights and anti-parity that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monée are among the artists who will act on this year's event in New York, presented by Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the sea as a "block" to put an obstacle to Russia's energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
"If necessary," Washington may use its sea to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, revealed US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, in particular, where they responded to the call from the legitimate government, is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they intend to interfere with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern coast of Europe," he said.
And, according to the governor, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has the ability, with its sea, to ensure that maritime roads are open and, if necessary, to make blocks to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke is addressed to participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group entitled "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In its intervention, it continued to compare Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, referring to them as actually the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, rather or less, to promote and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "the magic of a single trick" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements arise as soon as the Trump administration is in a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, in Russia's place, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, the authorities of the Trump administration, including the own president, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inadequate" pipeline project, which, according to Trump, became a "prison" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the North Stream pipeline, budgeted at $11 billion, intends to double existing capacity for 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for pressure and that consumers must have the ability to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position prompted a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the US to remain away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, chief of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will take a deep look at the possibility of candidateing for the presidency in 2020," said the Senator of Massachusetts.
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that he "will take a deep look" at the possibility of applying to the presidency to follow the intercalculation elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would measure the possibility of applying.
"It has reached the height of women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and this includes a woman as the most responsible," he said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take a closer look at the possibility of applying for the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, referring to "he was taking the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been a hard vocal critic of Trump and his appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet this Saturday, Warren mentioned that "of course we need an investigation by the FBI before the vote".
However, a survey carried out on Friday revealed that most of Warren's own constituents are not of the opinion that she should apply for the presidency in 2020.
59% of Moscow's "probably" voters said that the senator should not apply, according to the survey of the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Policy Research Centre.
32% give their support to their candidate.
The survey revealed a higher support than a candidate from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a potential candidate and 48% against.
Other prominent names of the Democratic Party discussed on a potential candidate in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions post-traumatic stress of Track Palin at Donald Trump's start
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after his arrest in September.
On Tuesday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence
"What my own son is going through, what is going on after he has returned, I can identify myself with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the injuries our soldiers are actually returning," said the public of a commission in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this detention "the elephant in the room" and said that his son and other veterans "returned a little different, became stronger, again wondering if there was this respect for which his fellow soldiers and aircraftmen, and all the other members of the armed forces, gave it to the country."
Track Palin was arrested on Tuesday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and possession of weapons while alcoholized, according to Dan Bennettt, spokesman of the Vasilla Police Department.
Twelve states and the Colombian District support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Ten states and the Colombian District are supporting a legal challenge to a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims of gang or domestic violence.
The representatives of the 18 states and the district sent a friendly friend's statement (friends of the court) on Saturday in Washington, in support of an asylum seeker who is responding to this policy, referring to NBC News.
The full name of the complaint in the Grace vs. Sessions process that American Civil Liberties Union submitted in August against politics was not revealed.
The person claimed that his partner "and his children, members of a violent gang", abused him, but the US authorities ignored his asylum application on July 20th.
The complaint was held in Texas.
Public ministries that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, such as nations facing generalized problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy rejected a 2014 decision by the Council of the Resources of Migrants which would allow immigrants to apply for asylum without missing domestic violence documents.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine stated, in a statement on Friday, that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws".
"The federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances subject to the same; this prohibition violates this principle," read the friendly curiae statement.
Lawyers also argued in this statement that the ban on the entry of immigrants by the police has a negative impact on the U.S. economy, pointing out that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "to make the necessary manual work available".
The Prosecutor-General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges to leave asylum to the victims of domestic violence and gangs in June.
"The asylum is available for those who leave their country because of persecution or anxiety based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a particular political opinion," said Sessions in their policy announcement on 11 June.
The asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems, or even all the serious problems that people face every day throughout the world.
Save efforts desperate in Palu when the number of deaths doubles in a counter-clock to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said Risa Kusumuma, a 35-year-old mother of a febrile baby of male sex, comforting him in an evacuation centre in the city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water."
Residents were warned that they would return to their destroyed homes to try to save everything they could find among their water seized.
There were hundreds of injuries and hospitals, damaged by 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who fraternized the coast and the shadow, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where the patients were treated abroad because of the strong Replica they continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears when he related what he felt when the violent earthquake threw him into the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris said to Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a marriage.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "advertising ads"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper has published a four-page announcement in a newspaper of the United States promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Thursday to China's pay-up supplement at Des Moines Register, the most outlawed newspaper of the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the elections of 6 November to Congress, a charge dismissed by China.
Trump's claim that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections marked the beginning of what the US authorities, in statements to Reuters, designated as a new phase in the growing Washington campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently working on an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides apply tariffs on imports from one another.
China's cut-off rates in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and North American specialists said.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products for China, said Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and American companies.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, "It is now putting its foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of advertising ads in our free press".
"With the dissemination of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the so-called American tradition of freedom of expression and press by publishing a payment ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad said.
"On the contrary, in the banks here in Beijing, we find very few dissident voices and we will never see a true reflection of the absence of views that the Chinese may have from the worrying economic trajectory of their country, as the media are under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention it.
Republicans alienate female voters before inter-elections with the disaster of Kavanaugh, warn analysts
At a time when many important Republicans support and defend what has been appointed to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various allegations of sexual aggression, analysts have concluded that this could lead to a negative reaction, particularly for women, during the intercalculation elections to take place in the short term.
The emotions around the case have been very strong, and most Republicans have already stated publicly that they intend to move forward for a vote.
These things don't go back," says The Hill Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher claimed that there is no doubt that the last hour pressure of Senator Jeff Flake (Republic of Arizona) for carrying out an FBI investigation would be sufficient to upset the rebel voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman of the progressive group MoveOn, according to Washington, D.C.
On Saturday morning, Protestants sang "november is at the door!" when they appeared at the Senate hall, as the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee chose to advance with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, told the Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will beat all the memories," said the news site Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst without partnership.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among the undecided voters in the suburban areas and the younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public witness describing his allegations of sexual aggression against the appointed Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans progressed with confirmation.
"This has become a trap for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republican at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the committee, or whether Kavanaugh will take his place as a judge. It's also about how the Republicans dealt with the matter and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities, a group that helps to select Democrats, to the news channel.
However, the Americans appear to be something divided about whom to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with a small majority to link with the first.
A new survey by YouGov revealed that 41% of the respondents believed absolutely or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35% claimed that they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% claimed that they considered Kavanaugh to be likely or absolutely false in his testimony, while only 30% claimed the same about Ford.
After Flake's proposal, the FBI started an investigation into Ford's allegations, as well as another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford referred under an oath before the Senate's Judicial Committee last week that Kavanaugh had abused her sexually while drinking when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the term for the Supreme Court exposed its genital organs when both attended a party during the period in which they were both studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, created a startup that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The most recent project of this legendary character of technologies, Inrupt, is a company that took part in the open source platform of Berners-Lee, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data are stored and who has access to this information.
In an exclusive interview to Fast Company, Berners-Lee said gamefully that the underlying intention of Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he referred to the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data storage" or POD.
This can include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
What is unique about the online personal data storage is that it is only for the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal training through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is to provide adequate resources, processes and competences to help make Solid available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project and a community of programmers on a voluntary basis.
At the beginning of this week, technology makers worldwide can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to the "Facebook and Google about the introduction or not of a total change in which all their business models are turned from one day to another.
"We're not asking them for permission."
In a publication on Wednesday on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission of Inrupt is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic with this next season of the Web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Honoring the Clerics Conciliated With Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only cleric of the Church of England to receive Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter was honored in its birth-town over 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann arrived on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellenglish and Lehacourt.
However, he died four days later by a franco-tearer and never knew he had received the highest British military honor.
His two grandsons closed a memorial plate at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was "excellently symbolic" that the plate had been presented exactly 100 years after the fact that she gave the decoration to her grandmother.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Coronel Vann led his battle on the way through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "in a very frequent snow and under a closed fire of portable and metal weapons".
Then he ran to the fireline and, "with the greatest strength," led the line forward before attacking himself a cannon and hitting three soldiers of the highlight.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann died on 4 October 1918, a few months before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, mentioned that his grandmother's acts were "something I know I would never get equal, but also a lesson of humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a crown of flowers after the stop, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he "was very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the strength of a genuine hero is being demonstrated through support that will be given by many people."
Fees of mixed martial arts agreed all night to see Bellator 206 attending instead to Porca Peppa
Imagine this: it is agreed all night to see Bellator 206, full of views and, finally, it is forbidden to see the main event.
San José's series included 13 battles, with six of the main groups, and was being shown directly during the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, the United Kingdom's spectators were scared when the cover changed to Paca Peppa.
Some have not been impressed after having been agreed until tomorrow especially for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change for animated drawings for children as "a kind of bad taste pad."
"The government's regulation says that content is not appropriate for six in the morning, so they had to change for another programming," said Dave Schwartz, administrator of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa Porca," yes.
The president of Bellator, Scott Cooker, said that the same would recant the transmission calendar to include the United Kingdom's representatives in the future.
"I think, when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem," said Cooker.
"But they're six in the morning there and we can't solve it until our Sunday hour, which is the second night in the British hour.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that when the programming changed, there were many messages exchanged and no very nice.
We were trying to solve the problem, and we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of battles to five instead of six, as we usually do.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" about his sexuality
The Olympic explorer Tom Daley claimed that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that gave him reason to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't appear until he entered school that "not everyone is like me."
In an interview with the first Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he expressed favour for the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said to become a father to make him less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
The regular presentation of the long date of the programme, Kirsty Young, took a series of several months due to illness.
Looking like a couple in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "lower" to everyone because "it was socially unacceptable to like girls and girls."
In his words, "to this day, this impression of us feeling smaller and different has been the real reason which gave me power and strength to achieve success."
His goal was to prove that he was "someone," he said, not to deduce everyone when they discovered their sexuality sooner or later.
The two Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to criminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he appeared because he felt happy that he could live openly without consequences and wished to give others "hope".
The world trimester referred to falling in love with a man, American cinematographer Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "I got surprised."
Daley happened last year with Oscar's winner, 20 years old, although he has stated that the age difference has never been a problem.
"When we're so new" - his first participation in the Olympic Games was at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he mentioned, it's hard to find someone of the same age that has passed by similar high and low.
The marriage had a child last June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his perspectives" had changed.
"If I had been asked last year, all that mattered was "to win a gold medal," he said.
"But you know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 40 years after being diagnosed with cancer in the brain.
Daley mentioned that his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether there were tickets for the London games in 2012, because he wanted to be on the front line.
"I couldn't tell him "You're not gonna be here to be in the first row," he said.
"I was trying to assure him not when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and obtained a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of all my life: walking in front of a multitude of compatriots in the Olympic Games... there was no better sense," he said.
All of this was also the inspiration of your first choice of song - Proud, of Heather Small - which was identified during preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives you skin of chicken.
The Desert Island Discs takes place on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British summer.
Mickelson downstairs in the bank at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will reach a record on Saturday when arguing his 47th game in Ryder Cup, but he will have to recover his way to prevent the frame from picturing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing on the 12th time, a record of participation, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk in the fourballs and Saturday's forzoms.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as has often been in the teams of the United States, the fifth winner of the major male champions divided the day between the support function and the work in their game in the field, in the hope of correcting what hurts him.
Never having been hit by the most rarely even in the height of your career, the 48-year-old player is not the ideal for the Le Golf National field, where the long race usually beats the wrong tattoos.
And if the field alone wasn't scary enough for itself, Mickelson, on Sunday's 9th, will face the precise British Open Francesco Molinari champion, who made a team with beginner Tommy Fleetwood, winning all the four matches they argued this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point disadvantage to start 12 single games, record a good start, the Mickelson game can become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he couldn't say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a palm on my back, put his arm around my back and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has great confidence in himself.
It's a respected champion who gave great attention to these teams in the past, as well as this week.
I probably haven't seen him play two games yet.
I thought about it more, but that's what happened and that's how we thought we should go on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else."
Mickelson will cross the Nick Faldo record on Sunday of the largest number of matches in Ryder Cup.
This may mark the end of a career in Ryder Cup that has never been able to match the success of your individual curriculum.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 victories and seven empathies, although Furyk has stated that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
"He's sarcastic, funny and spiritual, he likes to play with people and he's an excellent person to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun meeting him this week too, which was fun to see.
He gives much more than just playing."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage may disappear in an apace
Thomas Bjorn, European Captain, knows from experience that his leadership when he enters the last day of singles in Ryder Cup can easily become an accident.
The Danish had its star at the beginning of 1997 in Valderama, where a team captained by Hise Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but passed through the target line with the Nariz with the most narrowest of the margins, winning by 1411⁄2-131/2.
"We always try to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but little," said Bjorn, in the image, after having attended the victory of the 2018 Turma for 5-3, both on Saturday and yesterday, to lead 10-5 in Le Golf National.
So history has shown me and everyone on this team that this hasn't ended yet.
Tomorrow, give your best.
Go over there and do everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the points in the marker.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that's where the focus must remain.
I've always said I focus on 12 players on our side, but we're well aware of who's on the other side: the world's best players."
Delighted at the performance of his players in a difficult golf field, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow's what matters are individual performances and this involves a different task.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we're there for our account, our competencies as golfists are tested at the maximum.
This is the message you need to send to players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now you will leave the partner and he has to go and give the best of himself too."
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will ensure that its players have a better performance individually than as partners, making the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
The Furyk himself was already on both sides of these great revolutions on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before it ended up losing when Europe pulled out of the cartel the "Milagre in Medina".
"I remember all the words," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, Captain in 1999, motivated his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to get that early start as they came to Brooklyn and what they saw in Medinah.
When this pressure is directed towards one side, the pressure is very large in these middle parties.
We organized our effectiveness in conformity and ordered the players how we feel, you know, we're going to try to make magic tomorrow."
Thomas, with the mission to try to lead the counter-attack, faces Rory McIllroy in the main game, being Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players for this order because I think it covers all the tracks," Bjorn said about his choices for the singles.
New German warship once more adamant
The most recent defeat of the German sea should have entered the service in 2014 to replace warships of the time of the Cold War. However, it will be necessary to wait for at least until next year, due to the systems associated with accidents and a cost of exponential growth, according to local media.
The entry into the service of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the command ship of the latest broke Baden-Wuertemberg class, was now added until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military voice.
The ship should have joined the sea in 2014, but the concerns after delivery threatened the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuertemberg class that the sea had ordered in 2007 will serve as replacements for the Bremen class aged.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, in addition to a series of anti-ships and anti-ships, as well as some winding technologies such as reducing radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include more dilated periods between maintenance, which would allow the most recent missed missions with a maximum duration of two years along the port of origin.
However, the subsequent ones did that with the last generation warships, considered as a form of German design power beyond borders, they will already be detached when they enter service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate Fragat F125 made manchets last year when the German sea refused to put it in service, having returned it to the stables of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the sea returned a ship to the ship after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cite a series of crucial "hardware and software defects" that would make the warship useless if used in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, since Baden-Wuertemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers, only half of the quota needed in the old Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the sea to install additional features in the future.
The 7,000-tonnes "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to have the good weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the price of the whole project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this will have reached an amazing 3.1 billion euros, an increase towards 2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems affecting the most recent fleets have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German fleet is undermining.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the leader of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the sea is currently in use without ships capable of being used."
The politician said that the problem grew exponentially over time, as older ships were put out of service without ships to replace them.
Finally, he regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class's breakers could have joined the sea.
National Trust Spits the Secret Life of the Cats
New research is being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands with the aim of revealing how the ants use the landscape to search for food.
It is expected that the results will affect some light on the behaviour of these single flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and fruit and long earrings as well as Daubington's inverwe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations scattered by the property to track the activity of the pigs throughout the station.
Mobile studies will also be conducted by NTS staff and volunteers with portable detectors.
The analysis by specialists of all recordings will assess the frequency of the calls of the pigs and what each species is doing.
A map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of its behaviour on the territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, consultant for the conservation of the nature of NTS, expects the results to reveal which habitat areas are most important for the mammals and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of beaches, as well as the best way to ensure the maintenance of forests for mammals and associated species.
The populations of pigs in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have increased considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development work that affects bedrooms and make habitat scarce.
The organic turbines and the trailers are also a threat, together with mass killing papers and some chemical treatment of construction materials, in addition to domestic cat attacks.
In fact, the cops aren't blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when trying to catch the catch.
It is used by them a sophisticated location technique by echo to identify insects and obstacles in their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes the ants very seriously.
The organization has ten trained specialists who conduct regular studies, inspections of bedrooms and sometimes rescues.
It has also come to create the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to pigs, in the Trave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which hosts eight of the ten species of Scotch.
Property director David Thompson says the same is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Thrave we have an excellent area for kids," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many Veteran trees and all this good housing.
However, there is still much about the ants we don't know, so the work we've developed here and in other properties will help us learn more about what they need to flourish."
It stressed the importance of ensuring that there are pigs before carrying out maintenance in the property, as the non-intended destruction of just one maternity bed can lead to the death of up to 400 young women and animals, which could lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
The ants are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, kill them, poison them, disturb them or destroy their bedrooms.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate in helping.
It was because she said, "We still have much to learn about our mammals, and for many of our species, we just don't know how their populations are coming."
Ronaldo makes accusations of rape when his lawyers prepare to process a German newspaper
Christian Ronaldo characterized the allegations of rape against him as "false news", claiming that people "will promote themselves" using his name.
Your lawyers are preparing to process the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The advancement of the Portuguese and Juventus election was accused of violating an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that it will then have to pay $375 000 to keep the victim's claim silent about the accident, read in Der Spiegel on Saturday.
Speaking in a live video in Instagram to its 142 million followers hours after the disclosure of the allegations, Ronaldo, aged 33, characterized the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," he said to the camera the winner of five Gold Balls.
"They want to promote themselves at the cost of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the profession.
I'm a happy man and it's all right," added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to process Der Spiegel on the allegations, which have described as "an unacceptable report of suspects in the field of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would require compensation for moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident will take place in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they have been found in a night club, Ronaldo and Majorga will have to leave for the player's room, where he will have violated it once more, in accordance with the documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo put himself in trouble after the alleged incident and told him that it was "99%" "a good guy", damaged by "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the marriage had sexual relations, but that it was consensus.
Majorga also claims that she was directed to the police and had photographs of her injuries taken in a hospital, but that she would later have agreed to enter into an extrajudicial agreement by feeling "terrified by the prospect of kidnapping" and being concerned about the possibility of "publicly humiliated".
The woman, 34 years old, says she now intends to cancel the agreement, as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was ready to join the Royal Madrid, from the exit of Manchester United, at the height of the alleged aggression. This summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in a 100 million euros business.
Brexit: United Kingdom "repent" to lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "repent" if its status as world leader in the car factory after Brexit is lost, said the Secretary for the Greg Clark Enterprises.
Clark also mentioned that Toyota in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if Britain had come out of the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop its production in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer pointed out that the impact of delays on borders in the case of an unaccompanied Brexit could lead to loss of jobs.
Burnaston, which produces the models Auris and Aventis of Toyota, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My perspective is that if Britain leaves the EU irregularly at the end of March, we will attend the production parades in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom expressed concerns about the EU's exit without agreeing on the level of operation of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, mentioned that it would close its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to the fact that manufacturers claim to be the risks of the supply chain in the case of an unaccompanied Brexit.
Toyota's production line is managed on a "just-in-time" basis with the pieces to reach every 37 minutes, from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and in the EU, for cars manufactured by order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be border disturbances, which the sector says can lead to delays and lack of pieces.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of stocks in its Derbyshire factory, he said the company, so production would have to stop.
Clark said that Theresa May's "Checkers Plan" for future EU relations was "scalibrated precisely to avoid these border checks".
"We have to have an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that allows, as he said, not only the current success but also the benefit of this opportunity," said the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
"The evidence not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers points out that we absolutely need to be able to continue with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Although it has not been able to provide an estimate of the time of stopover, Toyota pointed out that, over the long term, the increased costs reduced the competitiveness of the factory and could, sooner or later, lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinated the United Union union in this area, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never come back.
A government spokesman said that "we have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
A meeting of Trump with Rosenstein can be re-adjaved, says the White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein may be "added another week" given that there has not yet been an understanding of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed for the Supreme Court, referred to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between the councillors of Trump and Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The fact that Trump can be preparing the shipment of the Deputy Attorney General, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk, has fed rumours in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of unmistakably recording the talks with Trump and the possibility of leaving the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Tuesday he moved to the White House, having information that he would be ready to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Friday with Trump, which was held in the United Nations, in New York.
Trump said that "I'd rather not cancel" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then added to avoid overlap with a hearing by the Senate Justice Commission in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Saturday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week on the charges against Kavanaugh, after final vote in the Senate.
Trump's press adviser, Sarah Sanders, participated in Fox News Sunday.
Questioned about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been marked, it may be this week but it may also be added more than one week, bearing in mind all that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would not agree with this statement: Sanders has not organized a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences is not due to a "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said: "It is not inconsistent that they like protagonism."
He must then understand that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President has more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, adding, without adding evidence: "We have analyzed these numbers."
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but if the press has an opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that is far better than talking to me.
We tried to do this often and saw that we had done it in the last few weeks, and the fact that they could talk to the President of the United States replaced any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences, when receiving foreign representatives.
The press conferences on the ground are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, he compared himself in a way that was disoriented and sometimes strange to the journalists present.
Health Minister writes to EU workers in the Swedish National Health Service about Brexit's crises
The Ministry of Health wrote to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express their gratitude and to ask them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter at least six months from the EU's exit.
The Swedish government has already committed itself to cost the candidates for the status of EU citizens who work in decentralised public services in the country.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, pending decisions for this autumn.
But the Government of the United Kingdom has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate at this moment how valuable the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
colleagues from all over the EU and from other sources bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie submitted to emergency surgery after suffering infections in the head
The defense of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was submitted to an emergency surgery after suffering injuries in the head on Saturday defeat for 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ, of the Tigers.
The trainer of the Tennessee team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He approached the side line and practically disappeared," Reed reported.
The technical team and the medical staff placed Abercrombie oxygen on the lateral line before putting it in a bag and transporting it to a deeper evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris of Nashville's WSMV, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type/beverity of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when this happened.
Abercrombie, a second year student, suspended the studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after an Illinois transfer.
He made five platoons on Saturday before leaving the game, which raised his total of the season to 18 platoons.
A higher interest rate will be charged to foreign buyers when acquiring properties in the United Kingdom
The Conservative Party announced plans to cover a higher interest tax for foreign buyers who acquired properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to non-abrokers
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract the youngest electorate
The rise in the excise duty will affect buyers who are not taxed in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to reach up to 120 million pounds per year to help the homeless
A higher interest tax rate will be charged to foreign buyers who acquired properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional receipt to be invested in the aid to non-apricots, will be announced today Theresa May.
The measure is still an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract the youngest electorate, with promises to provide more accessible accommodation and to take the highest results.
The rise of the seal tax will affect people and businesses that are not taxed in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to stimulate the government's campaign to offer a roof to those without a roof.
The ceiling - added to the current seal tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second rooms and rental purchases - can rise to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to reach up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time purchasers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in capital - have become "farm cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a section of the seal tax to help young people acquire their first apartment.
He urged the large construction companies to maintain the prices of the properties high in areas which they do not use, requiring Ms. May to leave the quotas on the available rooms to resolve the "difficulty of accommodation" in Great Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a joint appeal for housing reform proposals, including income checks and the end of costs "without justification".
He also wants to assign extended powers to the municipalities for the construction of new houses.
Mrs May said: " Last year I said I would commit my mandate to restore the British dream that living conditions should be improved for each new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who wanted to live, work and build their lives here.
It is not sure, however, that it is so easy to buy home for people living outside the United Kingdom and for foreign companies as well as for British residents.
For too many people the dream of being the owner of your house has become too far away and the shame of those who sleep at rest continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland trainer Jack Ross said his "later ambition" is coming to become a selectr of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scottish has been successful in the challenge of giving new life to the club in the north-east, currently third-classed in the First League, the three points of leadership.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after directing St. Mirren on his return to the First Scottish Division in the past.
"You want to represent my country as a player.
But I just got an internationalization B," Ross said to the BBC's Sports Sound program Scotland.
"I grow up to see Scotland playing in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if you succeed in managing clubs."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland trainer include Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of the Athletic Alloa says he did not feel anxious about having such dedicated names in a club of such great size after refusing invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, from time to time success is called "can I take the club back to Premier League?"
Given the structure and facilities of the club, its location is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to take the club back, but I'll just think I've been successful here when I reach that goal."
Ross's career as a coach has only three years, after a period as an assistant trainer in Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts technical team.
The Alloa then helped recover from the decline to the third division and took St. Mirren from the threat of dispromotion to the title of the campaign at the next time.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Take account of Alloa "it was a real mess," you remember.
"I've always seen myself more in the training role than in the player.
It looks weird 'cause it worked well, I got my life as a player and I had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face the stress and pressure of the job, but I feel very well as a trainer.
You always want to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I ever feel in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint are the 17:30 Saturday, according to a study
The summer's heat wave covered the British pubs, but it put more pressure on restaurants chains.
Restoration groups recorded an increase of 2.7% in sales in July, but the number of restaurants increased by 4.8%, showing statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consultant, who compiled statistics, said: "The continuation of England's good time and career at the World Football Championship, longer than expected, made it possible for the standard of June, in which the pubs recorded an increase of 2.8% in sales, if repeated in July, but restaurants knew a relapse.
The decrease of 1.8% registered in the sales of the restaurant in June was worse in July.
Pubs and bars with the absent business in the drinks had far the best performance, with a homologous growth more than compensated for the decline in restaurants.
Pubs with the business absent in the restaurants were also aware of difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of the restoration operators.
Looks like people just wanted to get out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars managed directly, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6% over the month, with meals to collect 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst for the laser and RSM restoration sectors, said: "These results prolong the trend we've been recording since the end of April.
Meteorology and the impact of major social and sports events continue to be the main factors affecting the market for out-of-house food.
It is not surprising that restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual drop in sales of 4.8% is particularly harmful when it comes to the extension of the cost pressure.
The long summer and hot summer could not reach the operators with the business away from the meals. Only time will tell if the most dangerous temperatures we know in August will provide so much relief."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the widening of the launch of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sectoral indicator of sales of the British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, being recognised as the sector's benchmark.
One in every five children hidden from parents secret accounts on social networks
One in every five children - some with only 11 years of age - has secret accounts on social networks that are hidden from parents and teachers, revealed a study
An survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the "false" pages in Instagram
The news heightens the anxiety about publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a "primary" account to show their parents
One in five children - some with only 11 years of age - creates accounts in the social networks that hide adults.
An survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in the "false" accounts on Instagram photo sharing site.
The news intensified the anxiety about the publication of content of sexual nature.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have an independent "primary" account to show their parents, having at the same time private accounts.
A mother who found the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found out that the teen encouraged others to "viole her".
The study conducted by the Digital Awareneness UK and the Conference of Independent Schools (HMC) revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of which allowed for private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers feel tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Eileh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the Council of Scottish Athletics
Elidh Doyle was elected Executive Director of the Scottish Athletic Council at the annual General Assembly of the regulator.
Doyle is the most practical medal of Scottish athletics. President Ian Beattie described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of their vast international experience over the last decade.
"Sheilh is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and global community of athletics and we are sure that Scottish athletes will have much to gain with their presence in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited about being able to act like the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to helping direct sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 and 400 meters of evidence in the Atlantic Olympic Games in 1996, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator in BBC, stopped walking after suffering a transient ischemic vascular accident.
As he wrote on Twitter: "It's been a month of brain vascular accident.
I stopped walking.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I could get it back and until I did.
It's been a painful job but I've reached a total recovery, I've learned to walk again and I've even been practicing hard!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Advertising of milk extraction bomb compares mothers to cows, sharing online opinions
A milk extraction bomb company shared online opinions with an ad that compares mothers who love cows in order.
In order to mark the launch of what is described as the "first silent portable milk extract bomb", Elvie's consumer technology company launched an anonymous announcement inspired in music videos to highlight the freedom granted by the new milk-producing mothers.
Four mothers dance in a full-time holiday at the sound of a music that includes verses like, "Yes, I'm ordering, but I don't have any" and "If you haven't repaired, I don't have tits, these are my tits."
The Refrigerator continues: "Bomb, bomb, baby food, bomb, bomb, I'm ordering my kids."
However, the announcement published on the company's Facebook page generated online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it eased the "horrors" of the Latinian sector.
"Three decision to use cows to announce this product.
Like us, they have to pregnant and give the light to produce milk, only their babies are stolen a few days after birth," wrote one observer.
The Elvie extraction bomb is discreetly inside an amateur suite (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Of course traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to announce an extraction bomb for mothers who can stay with their babies?"
Someone still said, "A announcement with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the ad, like a woman who admitted to finding the "silarant" song.
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still hunting, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a crazy joke, but it makes all sense.
This product is great," wrote one of the women.
Another commented: "It's a fun ad addressed to mothers who take milk (often in bathrooms or at work) and feel like "vacas".
It is not an announcement to praise or judge the Latin sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discrepancies located in the suites.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the information that many women who extract milk with bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie bomb is completely silent, there are no wires or tubes and heads discreetly inside a breast-feeding suite, giving women the freedom to move, touch their babies and even get out of home while they extract milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of "Mother", commented: "The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that deserves a boring and provocative launch.
By establishing a parallel between women who extract milk and milk cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while we presented it in a fun way and that people could identify the incredible sense of freedom provided by the new bomb.
It wasn't the first time Elvie bomb was gone.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children jumped into the passerelle to design Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children discreetly displaced for a camp at the border of Texas
The number of migrant children detained reached a peak, although the monthly crossings at the border have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the rhetoric and strict policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to rear children.
Traditionally, most of the "parents" are themselves undocumented immigrants, seeking to compromise their own ability to stay in the country while offering to acquire a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential employers and other adults who integrate their family aggregates should register their digital impressions, being the data shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and Alfandengas Control Service official, witnessed before the Congress that the service held dozens of people who had applied for shelter from unaccompanied minors.
The service subsequently confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no previous criminal activity.
"By 80% of the parents or members of the family aggregates are illegal in the country, many of whom are foreigners with a criminal record.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In order to accelerate the processing of children, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of the date of detention, instead of 60 days, in accordance with the previous rule, in accordance with the staff of the reception centres.
Many are present at videoconference, and not in person, in order to defend their application for legal status before a judge of the immigration court.
Those who are considered unlawful for aid will be deported soon.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which may lead to access to violence or refugee attempts, according to the reception centres staff and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights defenders say that these concerns are excessive in installations of larger sizes like those of Tornillo, where large size contributes to the neglect of children's signs of disturbance.
They add that the transfer of children to the camps without leaving time for emotional preparation or for the rejection of friends aggravates the trauma that many are already discussing.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal from the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam also requested the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, despite the war in the country to be found in his eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally found only in Syria under the pretext of the fight against terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such".
"They must immediately and unconditionally withdraw," said the Assembly.
Moulalem insisted that the "war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that left millions of displaced.
It was said that Damascus would continue to "work this sacred battle until we free all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and from "all and any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and advising the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country destroyed by war.
In the case of refugees, Moualem mentioned that the conditions for his return were ensured, accusing "some Western countries" of "scaking irrational measures" that led the refugees to stay abroad.
"We ask the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"You are politicalizing what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria while there is no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in the last great rebellion of Idlib created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented a large-scale attack on the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement established "clear paths" and expressed hope that military action would see the Jiadists, including the combatants of the Al-Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the panel should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Because Trump will win a second mandate
According to this logic, Trump would be reelected in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, the prosecution and scandals end its presidency in advance.
The one that would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic finality of a Presidency"!
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue from the inspectors.
Since 2014, the novere-hour hearings have doubled to 1.05 million in the CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators in November, a peak of 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the cable hearings with up to 3.5 million spectators on the big news nights.
"This is a strong call for people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC program "Designed Survivor", about a head of office who becomes President after an attack that destroyed the capital.
Nell Scovell, a eating veteran and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club", has another theory.
Remember once he called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh," told Scovell.
Cakes have a value of entertainment.
Of course, contrary to television programmes, the stories from Washington can determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to the family meeting of immigrants and the health of the global economy.
Change of program is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can give.
And yet, it is more than being a citizen informed when we are attending the sixth hour of an expert debate on the use by Bob Woodward of sources "with deep knowledge" in his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather bloc of 15,000 dollars ("a piece of clothing full of insolence", according to Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' s extensive descriptions of... hum... anatomy of President Trump.
For my part, I will never again face Super Mario in the same way.
"Part of what he's done seems to be a reality show because he gives us something all night," said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pown Stars", on the dynamic list of Trump and the daily rounds of the network (attached to NFL, praised Kim Jong-Un).
We can't lose any episode or stay behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week they were 26th on the north coast of Kauai, but he was closed at home, selling MSNBC while writing to CNN.
He did not download television while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to testify before the Senate Justice Commission, with the future of the Supreme Court in play.
"I still remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said: this is the principle of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a piece, but finally they were right."

Significant external funding in the intercalculation elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th circle knows a flow of funding, thanks to a realisation of the electoral circles that left two holders on the run at the same place.
The recent re-adjustment of Pittsburgh's suburban circles placed the Conor Lamb Democrat in the race, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is a candidate for another title, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which is largely above the new 17th circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had decided in January that the former circles were inconstitutionally favouring the Republicans.
The 17th circle launched a strong debate on the financing of the campaign between the financial arm of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tanning victory in the extremely controversial March special elections for the 18th electoral cycle of the Pennsylvania Congress.
This place was occupied more than a decade ago by a republican and President Donald Trump won in the circle for 20 percentage points.
Analysts have given a slight advantage to Democrats.
The United States was able to punish El Salvador for supporting China, followed by
Some diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Pequim, with few Washington protests.
President Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organisation from the direction.
Representatives of the Department of State decided to call the leaders of the North American diplomatic representations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after the "Recent Decisions to Stop Recognizing Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the Department of State, in a communiqué this month.
But only sanctions against El Salvador were considered, which received about $140 million in 2017, including drug trafficking control, economic assistance and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
Following the internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America held a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, followed by a similar meeting last year as a step forward in efforts to prevent the entry of immigrants into the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials of the Administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, on the whole, and any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has arranged an intervention at the conference, now marked for mid-October, in a signal of the importance the administration assigns to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American representatives discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any hard messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three North American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak on internal deliberations to cover the anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study History
The next bomb to be launched may be the report by legal adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, on which there are currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will rightly direct his investigation in order to find out whether the Trump campaign was committed to Russia in order to attack the elections.
If the Congress changes its hands, Trump will face the responsibility of that body at the same time as it is prepared to present itself again to the voters and perhaps to be judged by its parents.
There are many hypotheses and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's absence is inevitable - or his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the war.
In 1938, some German officials were ready to present Hitler with a coup, since the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carniquiry that followed.
The course of History revolves around points of inflation such as this, in which the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or traversed.
The North Americans are currently facing several of these points of concern.
What shall we do if Trump dismiss the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this paper reported that last year he suggested secretly writing the President, speculating about his inability to carry out his task.
Rosenstein says The Times news is wrong.
"How will we respond if the recent requested FBI investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court, despite the credible allegations of sexual abuse and indecent witnesses?
And above all, will we vote in the intercalculation elections for a Congress responsible for Mr. Trump?
If we jump into these tests, democracy will be ready to cross a long desert.
But I believe we're not going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that in time occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to burn Sabath candles at that table with susistic.
With a legacy of these, how could he not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorns of the Optimistic Rangers before the game with the Vienna Speed
The Rangers receive Vienna's Rapid on Friday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive impact in Spain with the Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will leave them in a good position to qualify for the Group G of the European Union.
A joint injury prevented the average Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the time until the empathize two holes with Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a trampolim for higher flights.
"It was a good win for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We will finish the game with a positive mind and win a point.
Maybe we could have won close to the end, but, in global terms, empathy was probably the fairest result.
They probably were better in the first part but we gave back and ruled in the second part.
It will be a big European night on Friday.
I hope we can win the three points. It will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good outcome in the last game but, with the support of the public, I am sure we will give our best to achieve a positive outcome.
The last year was very hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and players are having fun; the trains run well.
I hope we can give our best, forget the past and achieve success."
Women are losing their dream of this life-reform account
Despite the fact that participants in the survey have a clear idea of the kind of care they intend to take, few people talked to their families about the matter.
About half of the individuals interviewed in the Nationalwide study referred to their spouses on the cost of continued care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to children on the same subject.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they're not having this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Framework.
That's how it starts.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of them if you don’t let them know your wishes with due advance.
Work with your consultant and your family, discussing where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
It involves its financial consultant: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay these expenses.
Your continuing care financing options may include a long-term long-term long-term long-term insurance policy, a hybridised policy with monetary value to help cover these costs or funding by using its own savings, since it has these available values.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.

Man hit multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was hit several times with an air pressure when he returned home after one night in the city.
The victim, at home for 40 years, was in the Oxford Grove area, in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was reached in the chest, in the abdomen and in the hand.
The agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "an random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries did not involve a risk of life and the police asked witnesses.
We were and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that reached the Indonesian city of Palu on Saturday, referring to the authorities, expecting the number of deaths to increase.
With the interrupted communications, the rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donghaa region, a region north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude symmetry 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Doghara, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donghara is a region that extends over 300 km from the coast, west of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with administrative status lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Sulawesi Central, particularly in the coastal region of Doghía.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Doghea have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Doghía.
A tsunami also reached the western part of Doha in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Sysmic Fire Anel, which is regularly reached by us.
Here are some of the main ones we've been and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December a strong seismo on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, created a tsunami that reached 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of those in Aceh.
2005: A series of strengths we have reached the west coast of Sumatra, in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along Sumatra.
2006: A symmetry of magnitude 6.8 reached the south of Java, the most popular island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude symmetry reached the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude symmetry 7.5 reached one of the Isles of Mentawai, along Sumatra, dispersing a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A little deep seismo reached the region of Pidie Jaya, in Aceh, spreading the destruction and panic among the people who remembered the destruction caused by the 2004 deadly seism and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died buried under the roofs of buildings.
2018: Big six reached the tourist island of Lombok Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The six destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of temporary isolated tourists.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of aggression.
Palin, a 29-year-old resident of Vasilla, Alaska, was detained by suspects of domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and detention resistance, according to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he pulled out his phone.
Palin found herself detained in the pre-trial detention centre of Mat-Su, subject to a $500 loan, informed KTUU.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously innocent," reported the station.
Palin faces charges for three Class A crimes, which means he can be sentenced to a fine of up to one year and sentenced to $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B crime, punishable with a prison day and a fine of $2,000.
It is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of arresting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is to be tried by the Alaska Veterans Tribunal.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the prosecution of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a gun under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.

Sism and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died following a seismo that reached the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday.
The magnitude symmetry 7.5 originated a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications networks were cut off, expecting the number of deaths to rise in the next few days.
The seismo reached the region of Sulawesi Central, northeastern of the Indonesian capital, Jacarta.
They circle videos on social networks by showing the time of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Ministry of Public Affairs has rarely asked for capital punishment for suspected terrorist attack in New York
The Ministry of Public Affairs of New York calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state by a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an attack in October, on a bicycle in the West Side Highway, in the Manhattan Valley, facing pain and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intensely" and affected "intensely" serious injuries, according to the notification requesting the death penalty, registered in South New York.
Both charges may be punished with the death penalty, in accordance with the judicial document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including eight charges of murder to the service of organized crime, usually used by the Ministry of Public Affairs in cases of organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required a "considerable planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed it as "atroz, cruel and abusive".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," refers to the notification.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago the South York area did not require the death penalty for a charge.
The river, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug traffickers, but the penalty was sentenced to eternal imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit spy acts in favour of the Soviet Union two years earlier, during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court's documentation, Saipov, of course of Uzbekistan, did not demonstrate any delays in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators to feel good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charge.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, he referred to the police.
It was declared innocent in relation to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defence attorneys, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty instead of accepting a conviction of guilt for eternal imprisonment, without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defence team had previously applied for prosecutors who did not apply for the death penalty.
Mr Conservative said that NIGEL FARGE should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today "moving the popular army" during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians should "feel the pressure" of the Eurocetics, while one of those Members of Theresa May suggested that he should lead negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Conservative Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would have gone out" if Farage was Minister of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile her deeply divided counterparts was highlighted by conservators who defended her stay, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has discussed maintaining its commitment plan, known as the Chechers Plan, in the face of attacks by Brexit's parties, the defenders of sustainability and the EU.
The allies insist that she will continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the protests, by forceing the Eurocetics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and the Caos.
Mr. Bone said at the beginning of the Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he intended to "complete the Plan".
Good suggested that Farage should have been entrusted with responsibilities in negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we'd have gone out already," he said.
Mr Wellingborough added: "I will continue to defend Brexit, but we should finish the Plan."
Strengthening its opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two World Wars to be subject to.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
Good rejected the claims that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed ideas and wants to stay is completely broken."
Brexit Conservative Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration, saying to journalists: "I just say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition won't approve it, it's unpopulated in our own party and with the soldiers who take the campaigns to the street and to whom we must choose.
Let the Chequers Plan fall and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "Only the prime ministers who know how to keep promises will keep their jobs."
Farage said in the demonstration that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they hesitate to bring the decision out of the 2016 referendum.
"This has become a matter of confidence between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"You're trying to bring Brexit and we're here today to tell them you won't know about it."
Turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to pressure our political class, which is at the edge of bringing Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become an independent, proud, and self-governing United Kingdom."
However, the defenders of the stay left in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour start in the city center.
A crowd of activists posted reports with the message "Conservatives against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
The representative of the Workers in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with an application of the party at the opening of the convention.
"These are the people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for 'More Canada', for the unattractive border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete façade.
There is no good Brexit," he concluded.
Warren planned to "seriously weigh" any candidate to the President
North American Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will "seriously vote for the President" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is invited to re-election in November against the Republican President Geoff Diehl, co-mandate of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that it will be able to face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with the voters in the form of a debate since the takeover of Trump's possession.
One of the participants asked him if he was planning to apply to the Presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for "women to go to Washington to fix the problems of our government and that includes a woman instead of top".
Arrest in the area of the murder of Wade Sims, of the LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge's police, Louisiana, announced Saturday the detention of a suspect in the case of the murder of the LSU Tigers basketball player, Wade Sims on Saturday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
The police had released a video of the shooting on Saturday morning, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the images.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot near the South University campus on Friday afternoon.
"Wayde Sims took a shot at his head, following which he had just died," said the chief of police, Murphy J. Paul, according to the 247sports on Saturday.
Wade defends a friend and has been targeted by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted his presence at the site, imploding a gun, acknowledging that he had attended the Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without presenting resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police team.
Sims, a junior of 1,98 meters created in Baton Rouge, had 32 games and was titled 10 times in the past, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recoverys per game.
Russia's Great Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel in the team's order sequence
It became clear from the time Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the team's orders at Mercedes played a central role in the race.
Out of the pool position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind to defend his position on the first two curves, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was first to the boxes and made Hamilton have to face the end of the plate, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes was at the boxes one time later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton crossed it after a refrigerant, after which Ferrari's pilot repeatedly left the inside of the free track, at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was in the seventh place at the end of the first time, on the day of his 21st anniversary.
He then led a large part of the race, switching too late of tires, which would allow him to be fast in the final part, in order to cross over Kimi Raikkonen to finish in a fourth place.
She just came to the boxes on the 44th time but couldn't improve her rhythm in the last eight times, which allowed Raikkonen to finish in a room.
"It's a hard day because Valtteri did a great job throughout the weekend and was a real knight, letting me cross over.
The team did an extraordinary job, which allowed us to finish the first two positions," Hamilton said.
Pessimism of body language
President Donald Trump ridiculousd Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday because of his insistentness that she would not have revealed a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to Ford's testimony in front of the Senate's Justice Commission, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "more, more malicious and false".
"Look at the beautiful thing that's happening in the Senate in the last days, see the anger, see how people are more, malicious and false," said Trump.
"When we see the escapes of information and communications and when they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, you run away from yourself?
They remember her answer... she published the document?
Oh, no.
The escape didn't leave me.'
Well, let's wait there.
The run away from us... no, it wasn't us," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape occurred in early September, but he assumed that the fugitive had left his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal her story," said Feinstein to the Commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected her request."
But his resignation did not convince the President, who commented during the beginning of the Saturday night: "You know that more, that was a bad body language.
Maybe it hasn't been her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the appointment to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would be using the charges in their favour.
"They are determined to regain power by resorting to all means.
We see evil, Malachiism, no interest in those who can reach, who must exert themselves to take power and control," said the President, according to the Mediaite.
First Division: Dundee Stars won by Belfast Giants by 5-3
Patrick Dwyer marked two holes by Giants against Dundee

The Giants gained an initial advantage of two goals with ends of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie hired the house team before Dwyer put the Giants in front again.
François Bouchard brought to Dundee before two of Lucas Lundvald's golls guarantee the team's victory.
It was the third victory of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had achieved a revolution on Saturday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee by 2-1.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, having won the Giants the three previous games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) following a assistance from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford helping Beauvillier increase the advantage four minutes later.
In a first franetic period, Sullivan once again put the team of the house in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquartt provided the empatial to Cownie at 15:16.

The house team reorganized and Bouchard returned with a strong gol at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined efforts to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, guaranteeing victory by marking the fifth goal of the team in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who lost four of the last five games, received Milton Keynes in the next game on Saturday.
Aerial controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape from traffic
An Indonesian aircraft controller has been called heroin after dying to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people died and many continued to disappear after a strong seismo had reached the island of Sulawesi on Saturday, originating in a tsunami.
Replicit powers continue to absorb the region, leaving many residents buried in the caves in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues had fled to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place while the control tower jumped violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained focused to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was then on the track, landed safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower in front of the huge collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman Johannes Sirait said that the decision could save hundreds of lives, announced the Australian television chain ABC News.
We sent a Balikapan helicopter to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"We were devastated with this news," he added.
However, the authorities believe that the number of deaths can reach the thousands, referring to the country's disaster management agency that access to the cities of Doghea, Sig and Butung is limited.
"The balance is increasing, as there are many bodies buried by the shoulders that we have not yet been able to save," said the spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency.
Waves of up to six meters destroyed Palu, where a collective funeral takes place on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and maintenance for the local.
Risa Kusumuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute there are ambulances with bodies.
There's no drinking water.
The minors are being shot all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, responsible for the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross Indonesia is in a race against time to help survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Vidodo came to Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the local military forces and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations. Are you ready?"
At the beginning of this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by six people who took over 550 lives.
Air Niugini reported now that there is a man missing after the landing of aircraft in the lagoon
The air carrier responsible for the aircraft which was deployed in a harbour in Micronesia, Pacific, reports now that there is a man missing after having reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued safely from the plane to land.
In a communiqué, Air Niugini stated that from Saturday evening he could not confirm the paradox of a male passenger.
The area company said it was working with hospitals, researchers and local authorities to locate man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local ships helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane had landed in the water while trying to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
Official entities said on Saturday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline progressed that six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all with a stable clinical framework.
You don't know what caused the fall or the exact sequence of events yet.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were united in claiming that the plane could not reach the track and landed in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane was off track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane came very low.
"That was the best thing that happened," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and other people had managed to pull himself up with the water by the belt and get to the emergency exits of the plane to drown.
He realized that the board assistants had gone into panic and began shouting, and that he had suffered a small stroke on his head.
According to the U.S. Navy, mariners who found themselves working on a work of improving a mollusc in the vicinity also helped rescue him by using an insulating boat to transport people to land before he sank 30 metres (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by Aviation Safety Network in the last two decades, 111 people died in accidents with registered PNG airlines, but no one involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the events of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The charge concluded its allegations on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of smoking a woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the phone records to reconstruct the movements of 20-year-old Argued Quintom Tellis, and of the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to the paper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several telephones that confirm that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had made earlier.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers at the time he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police were talking to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and claimed he had not been in the city that day.
When the charge asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in his car that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he had claimed that he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when he died.
The phone records indicated that they only met a week ago.
Rowlett stated that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis turned off the text messages, calls and contact information of Chambers on his phone.
"He caught her alive," said Hale.
The defence should begin to present its final claims on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would begin to be analysed by the jury at the end of that day.

Another black one?!
Love of New York marriage process by eviction through a text message "racista"
A love of New York is processing a marriage for discriminatory expulsion after she has been mistakenly received a text message from her mother to complain that "it was more black".
The marriage denied the charges of racism, claiming that the process was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, showed some concern when she discovered that the new love Giselle Maurice was black when this presented for her first working day in 2016.
"I CAN'T CREATE... BUT A PRETATE," wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending the message to the husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when he appeared out of his pocket, a "embarrassed" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Giselle Maurice by claiming the bad performance of the former African-American lover and who was waiting for a Filipino lover.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only day of work and sent to Uber's house.
Now, Giselle Maurice is processing the marriage and asking for a deposit compensation of USD 350/day for the six-month period for which she had been selected without contract.
"I want to show them that they can't be punished," said the Post on Saturday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The marriage rejected the allegations of racism, saying that dismissing Giselle was perfectly logical because they were not able to trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent you something that she didn't really mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racist people," Joel Plasco said to the Post.
"Would your children betray someone who had been treated badly?
Is your son born recently?
I don't believe it."
When calling the "extortion" process, Plasco said his wife had been mother only two months ago and had to deal with "a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to persecute anyone like that?
It's not very nice," added the investment banker.
While the legal process was under way, the court of public opinion was silent when condemning marriage on social networks, criticizing its behavior and reasoning.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's editors received that readers could not identify themselves with a talker
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book had been accepted, commented: "It's hard to get us into someone's skin that read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to know this now, after Paddington has been so successful."
He commented that his father, who worked as a camera operator of the BBC before being inspired by a little effort to play writing the book, would not have taken it to heart if the book had been rejected, and added that the 60-year-old anniversary of the publication had a agricultural taste given to his fascination last year.
About Paddington, who described as "a very important member of our family," said that his father was very proud of his success.
"He was a modest man and not a person given to gambling," he said.
"But as Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a successful son: we are proud even when the fact isn't ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to get off the phone.
Then after landing, the girl had been taken suddenly to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors were struggling to save her life.
"There was no help calling to say that the situation was so bad and that there were no chances of survival," said Mr. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and that she had to leave me.
That's what I did.
He said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medicines given to you by your doctor to keep your heart functioning were slowly stopping and getting out of your system.
I've been dead for a while and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to tell you."
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperouse, now struggling for the loss of his daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers willing to try what was going on.
"No one knew," he said.
"I'll always cry from my head down.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that felt a huge compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women of the same age are throwing cards on their chest to avoid suicide
Two women who lost loved ones who had committed suicide struggle to avoid others walking the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put cards on a galley bridge with motivation messages and phone numbers that people can use to get support.
Tyler, Sharon Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want no father to hear what I feel every day," he said.
Sharon Davis, 45 years old and resident in Lydney, said that the son was a promiscuous promiscuous chief with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
They all said they were lighting the room."
However, she quit her job before she died because she had been "drinking in the woods."
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I've always been worried about a possible impact."
Sharon Davis created the posters "to know that there are people who are available to help and who can talk to, even if they are a friend.
Don't close up on your own, you have to talk."
Kelly Humphreys, a long-term friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, shortly after the soda's death.
"I didn't say I was sad or depressed," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in your behavior.
On Christmas day, it was a trap. When the kids opened the show, he didn't even look at them."
He said his death had traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to go through: "Destruct a family.
No one is indifferent.
But we all have to keep living and fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is in play with the start of the FBI investigation
"I thought that in terms like what I asked for - a time research and a defined scope - we could be more united," said Jeff Flake on Saturday, and he was afraid that the commission would be "demoroning" in the face of an angry party approach.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Its relativity is only a matter of time.
The intermediate elections are only five weeks away. On 6 November, if the Republicans are expected to have bad results, they will see their attempts to choose their candidate to the frustrated Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators to force them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through whom she met Ashley, Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote on the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not true that Kavanaugh is able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to vote on the semester and confirm his position in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korea deserters decreased during the Kim regime
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean deserters for North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un's rise to power seven years ago.
In citing data from the Ministry of the South Korean Union, Park Byeong-seug indicated that 1127 deserts occurred last year compared with the 2706 of 2011.
Park stated that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that the smugglers asked for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang made no public statement.
General rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean deserters.
Only revealed that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them are by China, which has the longer border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China believes that deserters are illegal and non-refugee migrants, and it is common to repatriate them.
The relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still in war) have significantly improved in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that are at an impasse.
The discussions took place after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general, to collaborate in the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Ministers, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the United States for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and in these circumstances it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is historical and inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the minority in the Chamber, said that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, was hysterical and impatiently inadequate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I cannot stop thinking that if a woman had acted like this, she would soon be called a historian," Pelosi said about her reaction to the witness from Kavanaugh to the Senate's Court of Justice on Friday
Kavanaugh emotionally neglected all sexual abuse alliances with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made an emotional opening statement, sometimes in strict and soluble voice, when talking about his family and school years.
He also explicitly accused the Commission's Democrats, citing the allegations made against them of "grotess and conspiracy murder" organized by liberals sponsored by Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said to believe that the witness of Kavanaugh proves that he does not have conditions to serve in the Supreme Court given his preconceived behaviour against the Democrats.
"I think you have disqualified yourself with your statements and the way you attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
When he was asked if he would try to impose the effective appointment of Kavanaugh and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, it does not meet the conditions to be in the Supreme Court, nor even to serve in its current court," Pelosi said.
At present, Kavanaugh is a judge in the Court of Justice of the Circumscription Court of D.C.
Pelosi added that as Democrat, he received strong opinions from Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) or the case of Roe vs Wade, having enjoyed the reputation of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh asked questions about the possibility of withdrawing certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not a time to choose a historical and preconceived person for the Supreme Court and to expect us to be happy with the decision," Pelosi said.
Women need to know how to control their emotions.
It's a justified diet, months and years of emergency crossing, and it can't disappear without crying.
"We'll fight when we win," said Mr.a Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, don't you think?"
A woman with an executive role in a company helped me enormously. She told me that she also cried when she became pregnant, but she had created a technique. When she became pregnant and began to cry, she told the person she was talking to "I don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm tired."
And he kept going.
And I thought for myself... it's brilliant," continued Mr.a Steinem.
The tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are poorly interpreted.
I remember perfectly that, in an old job in a office dominated by men in which I was crying in unexpressable anger, being caught up by the neck by an older woman - a kind little friendly manager who terrorized me a little - and literally dragged to the stairs to hear me say
"You never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're gonna be satisfied that they're able to affect you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the Democratic Congressman's date in Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extraconjugal relationship on board a ship called Monkey Business and refused to apply, a extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder did not see why she could not apply for herself to the presidentials.
"It wasn't a very weighted decision," I said to laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and one was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who appealed to the situation of "The White of Snow and the Seven Years."
Given its late entry, the fund-raising was almost as desirable and he swore that he would only enter the race if he could reach $2 million.
A battle that was condemned to defeat.
He discovered that some of his sympathizers only gave him $250, although they had given him $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I'm entitled to a discount?" he asked.
When he announced that he would not go into a formal campaign, the emotions came up - thanks to the people who had supported him, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fund-raising and makes the message to the voters, instead of the delegates, and anger against sexism - and tears emerged.
"Even seemed depressed," recalled Patricia Schroeder when she spoke of the reaction of the media.
"I'd thought Kleineex was my business sponsor.
What would they write now in my epitaph?
"She's sick?"
How the trade war between the U.S. and China can be beneficial for Pequim
The first victory of the U.S. war and China was decisive, and although the end of the conflict is not in sight, from the perspective of the experts, the departure of the two countries can be beneficial for Pequim for a long time.
Donald Trump, President of the U.S.A., fired the first warning at the beginning of the year when important Chinese imports include solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week was marked by a significant increase in the situation with the new rates affecting goods worth $200 billion (EUR (EUR 150 billion) per year, which is half of all goods sent by China to the United States.
Pequim has always cut in the same currency, raising rates of 5 to 10 per cent for North American goods at $60 billion.
China has committed itself to following the steps of the U.S. and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will become vacant in the near future.
Making Washington return would mean meeting the requirements, but showing public service to the U.S. would be too burdensome for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Pequim makes good use of its trunks, the pressures imposed by the U.S. war can sustain China positively for a long time by reducing the interdependency of the two economies.
"In fact, the fact that a political decision of Washington or Pequim can result in an economic crisis in both countries is much more dangerous than observers could ever have predicted," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher dedicated to Asia's study at the Center for New American Security, a reflection group.
Minister for Foreign Affairs says Syria is ready for the return of refugees
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help in rebuilding a country destroyed by more than seven years of war.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam said that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that have left behind because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily life and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the countries since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who have stayed in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian regime would receive good assistance for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he noted that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries which sponsored the revolution.

It was all a team effort and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.

Involving statistical values of one of the biggest players of all times with 14 great winning titles and only beat by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-calibre performance throughout the tournament, the remaining elements of the U.S. Selection were discussed when they arrived at the fairway.
North American Captain Jim Furyk, spoke after his team's decadent performance. "I'm proud of them. They fought.
This morning, we were able to put some fear in Europe.
Let's fight.
My cousins are Thomas.
He's a big captain.
All 12 of his players were excellent.
We will reorganise ourselves and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to continue our work.
I like many of these 12 players and I'm proud to be your captain.
I've got to get my hat off the other team.
They were better."
