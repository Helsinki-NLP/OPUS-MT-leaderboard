Members of the Wales National Assembly are afraid that they look like Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly have agreed to amend their term of office to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament or member of the Wales Parliament).
The theme has begun with the plan to transform the name of the National Assembly into the Wales Parliament.
All representatives of political trends at the national meeting are concerned that this may lead to a laughing down.
One member of the National Assembly of Liborists said his group members are worried because this is contrary to the words “Twp and Pwp”.
For an explanation for readers outside Wales: a komikian word daft means kappak and pwp means kakat.
The board member said that the whole group was “not happy” and had given other names.
A member of the Wales Conservative Department said his group was “acceptable” but noted that the word “MWP” is very similar to the word “Muppet”.
For explanation: in the Kakur language there is a voice of vehe w similar to the English of Yorkshire.
The Commission of the National Assembly, which is preparing a legislative proposal for the current amendment, said: "The final decision on all names to which members of the National Assembly are invited shall, of course, be made by the members themselves."
The Law of the Wales Government in 2017 granted Wales the right to change its name to the National Assembly.
In June the Commission published the results of a public debate on proposals on behalf of the Assembly on behalf of Wales, which is based on the broad idea of appointing the Assembly as Parliament.
The Commission preferred the term ‘Members of Wales’, or ‘WMPs’, but in the public debate, participants also took part in the ‘MWP’ option.
The members of the Assembly are likely to provide other names, but the conclusion of the agreement may present a challenge to President Elin Jones, who should present amendments to the legislative proposal in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation also includes other changes in the working principles of the National Assembly, including the rules for the adoption of the rights of the members of the Assembly and the building of the Committee's system.
At the end of the vote on the appointment of members of the National Assembly, they shall remain in the legislative debate.
Macedonians organise a change in the name of the country of national vote
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to appoint their country as the "North-Macedonia Republic".
The vote is organised with the aim of resolving the ten-year-old dispute with Greece, which has its province of Macedonia.
Atheena has already claimed that its core name represents a requirement for this territory and has repeatedly submitted objections to the candidate for membership of the EU and NATO.
President Gjorge Ivanov of Macedonia, who is opposed to the referendum to be held, has said that he intends to abstain from the vote.
However, the sponsors of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, argue that the change of name is only a price that the country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Saint Martin's hours are changing because Harlem's churches are in trouble
"The older people I've talked to have said that there was one bar on each corner and one church," said Mr. Adams.
"There's no more."
He said that losing the bars is understandable.
"People are dealing differently today," he said.
"The bars are no longer life-cycles in the neighborhood where people stay every day."
As for the churches, however, he threatens that the money from the sale of the assets will not continue as long as the leaders wait, and “they are back in the beginning either later or later”.
Adams added that the churches can be replaced with the homes of the camps, which are full of people who do not extend help to the remaining saints in the neighborhood.
"The majority of those who buy houses in these buildings are white," he added, "which therefore speed up the arrival of the day when all these churches shut their doors, since it is unlikely that most of the people living here will become members of their churches."
Both churches built white congregations prior to Harlem’s arrival at the Black Sea Metro -- the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, the Church of Saint Martin ten years later.
The congregation of the original white methods departed in the 1930 ’ s.
The black - and - white congregation, which had previously worshiped God, oversaw the building’s rights.
The congregation of the Afro-Americans in St. Martin’s Church, in front of the Reverence John Howard Johnson, who also led the 125th Street Against Harlem’s main purchasers, was defeated when they refused to hire or promote blacksmiths.
In 1939 the damage to the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson’s congregation members planned to rebuild the building, they took into use a carillion, or watch game.
Father Johnson's son and officer at St. Martin's church, Rev. David Johnson named the cardinals with the title "for the benefit of the poor".
The Jewish cartoonist, however, gave it another name: "cultural value" and "non-replaced historical instrument".
The historian Tiffany Ng Michigan also noted that it was the first carillion in the world that played the black music Dionisio A. Lind, who continued 18 years ago to play the biggest carillion in the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather said the Church of Saint Martin didn't replace him.
The Church of St. Martin has been a history of architects and workers who have been involved with church air leaders, other parishioners in recent months.
The Presidium of the Church, i.e., the governing body of the congregation, consisting of air leaders, wrote in July that the Piss Council ‘will continue to provide costs’, although it was not even associated with the remuneration of the architects and employees of the Pisca.
Some of the members of the Community have overhauled the transparency of the activities of the fishing industry.
In California, a 13-year-old boy born after homewards was injured
According to the authorities, he attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who died in California after the homeowners on the open day.
The accident occurred just before 7:00 in the morning near Beacon's Beachi in Encinita.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that Saturday morning it was about half an hour's walk with friends when he heard the boy tappers and then went to another place to help the boy get out of the water.
In Hammel’s words, he initially felt that the boy had expressed his spirit over the arrival of the morning, but “you can see that the boy cried out, ‘ What was deceived!
I'm being mocked!"
The whole of her ring was very pressed," Hammel described the scene she saw when she came to the boy.
"I told everyone that they would come out of the water and say, 'The river is hot!'," added Hammel.
The dangerous situation of the boy was taken by a plane to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.
I don't know. I don't know.
The water rescuer and Captain Larry Giles said at the press conference that they had already been marked in the region a few weeks earlier, but then it was established that doing so is not a dangerous disease.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were located on the top of the street.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach, located in Ecinita, for 48 hours for research and safety purposes from Casablad to Swamin.
Giles added that there are more than 135 hospitals in the region, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury is planning to take power on the United Kingdom's beautiful product market
Sainsbury takes over Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams chains, creating supermarketable intermediates of beautiful products, where experts also work.
As part of an important contribution to the United Kingdom’s 2.7 billion-dollar market, which continues to rise in sales of molluscs and domestic products, large quantities of fine products are being tested throughout the country, taking them into account for the next year’s use in other fields.
As a result, supermarkets are invested in beautiful products because they seek a way to use the private space previously allocated to televisions, micro-navigation and household appliances.
Sainsbury said that it plans to double select its beautiful products up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw for the first time.
The existing product options from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Beis are also given more space in brandy areas, as is currently found in the Boots.
The Supermarket also brings back to the market a series of its products Boutique, where most of the products are suitable for vegetarians, as young buyers always require more.
In addition, the retailer Fragrance Shop will try to sell only two Sainsbury's son, the first one opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second one will be opened this year in Selly Oaks, Birmingham.
Buying and passing on the web from local food sources for the purchase of small quantities of food daily means that supermarkets must try more to convince people to visit them.
The director of Sainsbury has said that sales sites are becoming more and more like supermarkets, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight anti-sellers such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and industrial trade.
Sainsbury's has put Argosa's sales places in hundreds of shops. The same has been done with Habits's sales sites since Sainsbury bought both keys two years ago, which has reportedly supported food sales and changed purchases to be more profitable.
An earlier attempt by the Supermarket to update its taste and diet sectors with the end of failure.
Sainsbury tried to share the company with Boot in the early 2000s, but it ended up having enough over how to share the proceeds from the sale of patent goods in the supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of his 281-year-old medicine to his son in Sainsbury for 125 million laughs to Celesio, which belongs to the entire Lloyds Pharmacy marketing chain.
The strategy also plays its role in Lloyds, adding its four poe products to their product choices, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury's business leader Paul Mills-Hicks said: "We have changed the appearance and nature of our beautiful products to complement the environment around us for customers.
We have also spent money on those who have received special education, who are always ready to consult.
Our trade mark meets each other's needs, but the changing environment and pleasant places mean that we are now a competitive trading destination, which can change the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is a nightmare because Holly Willoughby created 11 million jokes.
Dragons Deni star Peter Jones went off "dangerous" when television director Holly Willoughby released 11 million yells from his lifestyle brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughbyl spends time with family members and relatives on Truly's brand.
A couple of businesses are compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The 37-year-old television director "This Morning" announced his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Deni angry with Peter Jones, putting them out of their luxury life-style trade mark in the last minute to focus on their new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources said that Jones was "morrowish" when a television star admitted at a press conference, which took place on the other day at Marlows Buckinghamshire’s headquarters, that his new contracts in the value of 1.5 million laughs meant that the woman no longer had enough time to devote herself to the brand of household goods and clothing.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and it was thought to double-detail Willoughby's estimated 11 million-dollar stock.
When 37-year-old Willoughby reported in Instagram that he was leaving Trulyn, Jones of the United Kingdom left one of his restrooms.
One source said: “Truly must have been Holly’s main priority.
This was supposed to guarantee her future further, so the woman thought she was doing it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave everything behind left him completely confused.
No one could believe what happened on the other day, because it was so close to the product chain.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse that is full of ready-to-store goods."
Experts believe that the departure of one single-charged audience from the "This Morning" television station can pay millions to businesses, as the choice of products ranging from divinists and royal clothing and household clothing is invested in the amount of money in the area and can also be accompanied by subsequent marketing of the product.
It can mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been with Jones and his wife Tara Cappi for nearly ten years.
Willoughby joined Truly with Cappiga in 2016. 52-year-old Jones joined the brand in March.
Couples travel together on holiday trips and Jones has 40% of the large share of Baldwin telecommunications companies.
Willoughbyt will become a M&S fireman and he will switch off Ant McPartlin's TV series "I'm A Celebrity".
One of Jones' close sources said last night: "I don't want to comment on his business."
Difficult Talk, "because of what we loved"
Trump was laughing at the criticism that had been directed at him in the news about his comment, which must be "valued by the President", and too positive for the North Korean government leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his part some "newistankru" voice:
"I haven't given up on anything."
He noted that Kim is after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a great step towards the release of North Korea's nuclear weapons, interested in the second meeting.
However, negotiations on nuclear discharge have ceased.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN summit on Saturday that North Korea does not see the US "responsible" response to the previous disarmament events in North Korea.
He pointed out that the United States will continue to be subject to burdensome restrictions.
The triumphal procession was much more exciting.
"We're going very well with North Korea," he said.
"The war started with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now it's all very good between us."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have produced good results: projects have been completed, projects have been helped to free the prison and the United States has been organized to bring the remains of American servants to their homes.
He also protected his inconsistencies with Kim.
"It is very easy to be presidential, but instead of letting 10,000 people wait for access to this crowded stadium, it is better than we have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing out to himself in front of the crowd.
Tsunami and soil are destroying Indonesia's island, killing hundreds of people
When the effects of the earthquake were eliminated, foreign government organisations were told that they did not need help.
Although more than ten percent of the Lomboki population was relocated, a national disaster was not announced, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have often expressed very clearly that they do not want international assistance, so that the creatures are a bit complex," said Mr. Sumbong.
At the same time as the organisation Save the Children joins a team that will go to Palus, it is still unclear whether foreign workers can work in the region.
The president of the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation in Paris, deciding whether international authorities would be allowed to help with the rescue.
In view of the frequency of soil in Indonesia, the country has been extremely poorly prepared to deal with natural forces.
Although the site has been built in Aceh for tsunamis, these have not been particularly widespread in other coastal areas.
Although the warning about Tsunami was given, there was a apparent lack of Tsunami treatment serum in Palus likely to decrease.
Traveling between the islands of Indonesia is also quite a challenge in the best time.
Natural disasters also make logistics even more complex.
In Limboki, the hospital staff who has stopped treating the victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has transformed Indonesia's cut-off industry into a central part of its electoral campaign and has distributed money on roads and roads.
The budget deficits, however, threaten Mr Joko's government, as soon as new elections are in progress next year.
Mr. Jokot, Indonesia, is also concerned about the tension between the gang members of the majority Muslim community, who have turned to the form of faith of an older man.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes because of the fighting between Christian and Muslim factions that took place in their homes, using massacres, vibes and rifles and other weapons of mass destruction.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge runs the game of gambling against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge survived the loss of Liverpool in Chelsea Premier League, dropping position at the 89th minute of the game in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge was fed by Jherdan Shaqirlt, who was about 27 metres away from Chelsea's colorful flight when his team led 1 :0.
He dropped his ball on his left before he dropped it in the far-set post.
The ball flew high above the penal area and lost the right side of the network over the corner.
It landed over the jumper with Kepa Arrizabal and crashed a network.
"I was just trying to get this position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq give the ball as much as possible, so I was just trying to win for me as much time as possible," said Sturridge on LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I made a mistake and gave him a lie no more."
At the end of the first half, Chelsea led 1 : 0 thanks to the 25th minute of the game, Belgian Star Eden Hazard was hit by a storm.
The Blues attacker ate this game back to Matthew Kovacici before he turned around on his way to Liverpool.
Kovacic gave the average fast food.
Then he dropped a beautiful airship leading to Hazard’s throne.
Hazard got through protection and hit the ball with his left leg of Liverpool player Alison Becker through a far-set post on the network.
Liverpool plays with Naples Masters at 3 p.m. Studio San Paolo Napolis in Italy.
Chelsea stands in sight with Videoton with UEFA Euroli on Thursday at 15.00 a.m. in London.
The number of injuries in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of earthquakes in Indonesia and tsunamis increased to 832, the state's disaster agency said on Sunday morning.

The image of Parliament Cromwell is the last reminder that is the reason why the "resign of history" button
This removal would be a positive justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious elements of England in the style of the Taliban, which the followers of the man from the second century C.E. did.
But Cromwell's association described Mr Crick's recommendation as a wise and attempt to re-write history.
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Association, said: “In the meantime, the debate on eradicating images was impossible for Oliver Cromwell Westminster to be left out of memory.
Cromwell did not take pictures in English civil war himself nor did he command others to do so.
Maybe false Cromwell was sacrificed for the actions of Thomas of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent presentation of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century's opinion and part of its historical description of the person who should continue to be respected in the opinion of people."
Mr. Goldsmith said to the newspaper The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people viewed the state of Cromwell’s Parliament as more severe in the late 19th century than today and, of course, for the power of the kingdom.
Whether doing so is an accurate reflection is an endless historical dispute.
It is certain that by the middle of the 17th century, the bridge has been made up of our people's future development, and Cromwell clearly represents one side of this gap.
His achievements as the Lord of Protection are also false to the praise and remembrance."
Killed by a killer killed by a Chinese farmer
According to local media surveys, Edela-Hinas attacked on the market at the plant with the guy who killed him.
A man who was introduced only with the family name Yuan was found dead and killed by the injured artery near the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, reported the newspaper “Morning Post” on Sunday in South China.
The shipper's preparation on 30 May 2005 in Xiningis Qinghai Province of China in its turn to vaccination.
Apparently on the third day he had come from the nearby province of Greece to sell 15 coins on the market.
The next morning a man found her dead, and he discovered that this strange passage had been opened.
He said that the condition was in the mouth of a large blood vessel.
According to the report, 249.47 kilograms per kilogram had been killed by a farmer.
"My legs were too bloody and damaged," reported the newspaper "Guyang Evening News" of the victim's "Wu word.
The security camera records showed that Yuan entered the market four o'clock in the morning at 4:40 a.m. to feed his brother.
His body was found about an hour later.
The dead animal did not belong to Yuan or to him.
The market leader told Eveing News that he wanted to be read so that he could not be attacked by anyone else until the evidence was collected at the police station.
The Yuan family and market leaders argue that a man's death is a compensation for his death.
However, it has been observed that these attacks on people are rare.
In 2016 he attacked a woman and her husband at their home in Massachusetts. A man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, she had laughed a hundred pounds [294.83 kg] of lead on the Wales house tractor until the woman was afraid of leaving the animal.
When one of the Oregones took off his own equipment in 2012, one of the men in Manitoba told CBC News that they usually didn't attack them, but because of the smell of blood, they might go crazy.
“They’re just toys.
They're very curious maracrites that don't want to hurt.
They just have to be quite a story," said the man.
Orcaan Rosa’s findings produce large quantities of ice cream in the United States
According to the forecasts, Rosa is weakened by a drought, moving across the north coast of Mexico in the direction of the iced water.
However, in the near future, Rosa will be brought to North Mexico and the United States of America.
On Sunday morning at 05:00 p.m., the classification of Rosa 136.78 kilometers per hour of wind as the first category Orcacanian, located 619.59 kilometres further towards Punta Eugenia from Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the Pacific Ocean will form a low-tank zone that moves east towards the western United States. When Rosa approaches the tropical storm on the first day towards the Baja California peninsula, it begins to move from deep tropical forests to the ahead of the United States.
On the first day, Rosa arrives in Mexico, where she gets up to five inches [25.4 cm] of winter.
Then there will be a tropical drought that is responding to the approaching low-carbon climate in the country’s future.
The location is caused by the risk of droughts, droughts and possible earthquakes of the winter from 2,54 to 10,16 cm.
The severe tropical drought results in an increase of between five and a half inches per hour, particularly in South-Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected to be between 5,08 and 10,16 cm in the hundreds in certain regions of the United States, particularly Arizona.
Excipients are possible due to rapid deterioration of tropical rain conditions.
Of course, it should not be possible to move your feet at the risk of tropical storms.
Strong winds can cause cannons to become fast-paced rivers and wind turbines and flying waves.
The approaching low-carbon region will bring the hottest winters along the coastal areas of South California.
It is possible to have a total of hundreds which extends over three inches [1.27 cm] and may cause smaller flooding and libetosis.
In the winter period, the first disease in the region would occur.
Troopilised winters will be closer to Arizona on Sunday afternoons and on Monday mornings, ice cream will become major on Monday evenings and on Tuesdays.
Strong winds arrive at Four Corner on the second day and stay until three days.
In October, large temperatures are predicted in the United States, which is due to Arctic warming, while temperatures remain still high in tropical areas.
Sometimes this includes major temperature changes in small areas.
In the United States of America, the sun is a great example of important temperature fluctuations.
The temperature fluctuations between Cansa City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebrasia), as well as St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) range from 20 degrees.
In the next few days, she tries to gather herself together again for long periods of solitude.
A large part of the United States of America is expected to start in October with temperatures around 80 °C, from the southern part to the eastern part of the country.
New York is expected on Tuesday 26.6 °C, which is about 10 °C.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that in the early half of October the United States is likely to show high average temperatures.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial took a look at over 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched, on Thursday, six telecoms, the top-level candidate Brett Kavanaugh and his alleged sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford, who was convicted of sexual assault in the 1980s.
At the same time, political ambiguity continued where the broadcasting organisations interrupted the series of regular broadcasts to reflect the last minute's rounds: Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona concluded an agreement with the FBI to conduct a uniform investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Legal Commission that he was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had cleaned him up and tried to tear his clothes off at the end of high school.
Kavanaugh said in his church service that he was absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the transmission of Nielsen's report showed more than 20.4 million people on the lines.
The company calculated the average of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC TV.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels showing this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has a common problem with the calculation of persons who see transfers in the authorities.
In comparison, it can be said that doing is about the same size as doing football in the final tournament games or sharing Oscars.
Fox News Channel opinion leaders who have strongly supported the appointment of the Kavanaugh office led all networks on average by 5.69 million viewers all day long, Nielsen said.
ABC 3.26 million went to another location.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
The interest was also increased after the trial.
Flake was the central actor of the rare drama.
After a statement by Kavanaugh by a moderate government office, the CNN and CBS cameras met in the morning when he was under the driver's driver's license, trying to take a lift to the Commission's seat.
He was standing in the country for a few minutes when he was charged with this CNN right over there.
"I'm standing here, before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the State the truth?"
She was told: "I have power, while so many women have been completely raped."
Fleke said that his department issued a statement and added before closing the elevator that he had more to say at the sitting of the Legal Commission.
A number of hours later, the cable and circuit networks reflected the direct message when the Legal Committee had to vote in order to send the appointment of the office of Kavanaugh to the Senate to vote.
But Flake said he was only doing this in the sense that the FBI was investigating the charges against the candidate the following week, which were required by the minority Democrats.
In the vein of Flake, a friend of Democrats spoke with Senator Chris Coon.
After a later conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
The decision of Flake had an impact because it was evident that the Republicans could not vote without the confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump initiated the FBI approach to Kavanaugh's crimes.
British Prime Minister May blames Brexit's critics in the political game
The Prime Minister accused the newspaper of interviewing those who consider his plan to leave the European Union, the "political game" of the future of Britain and the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend a conference of the Conservative Mission in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Theresa May, a former prime minister, stressed his attack on May in the direction of the Brexit Cabeplan, saying that the proposal on which the United Kingdom and the EU should meet a single tariff is "completely severe".
Wyde Simsi shooting: Police arrested Dytheon Simpson as a suspected LSU player in the murder
The police arrested a man who was suspected of shooting at 20-year-old LSU Corps by Wade Sims.
The 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was arrested and placed in prison with a second degree murder warrant, said Baton Rouge's police department.
The authorities published video between Sims and Simpson.
The police found samples from the incident site and said they were found by Simpson's DNA, informing CBS of the WAFB TV.
After Simpson was questioned, the police told him that the man had confessed to the murder of Wade.
The lawyer reported that a man's kidnapping was set at $350,000 (EUR 308,600,30).
The Coroner of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report on the reason for the death of hearings in the coal area.
The Division today supports the assistance provided by the police of the State of Louisiana, the State police station, the Southern University police and the people living in the region, which led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU sports leader Joe Alleva today for the region's legal protection bodies for “setting on the foot of poverty and justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
A 1,98-foot man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played the LSU basketball.
The average of his previous player's games was 5.6 points and 2.6 board.
On Friday morning, LSU CorvPalleer Will Wade said that the entire team is "lost" and "shocked" because of Wade's death.
"It's something you worry about all the time," said Wade.
Vulcan powder powder in Mexico City
The devastating destruction of Popocatepetl from the so-called volcanic eruption has reached the southernmost parts of Mexico as capital of Mexico.
The national disaster prevention centre warned the Mexicans on Saturday, ordering them to keep out of the volcano, as the crater resumed its activity, which resulted in 183 gas incidents and destruction.
The center is followed by several shades and colors.
The images shared in the social media represented thousands of cars covered in different parts of Mexico City, for example Xochimilcos.
The geologists observed an increase in the activity of the volcano in the main area of 72 km after the 7.1 magnitude of the earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The Don Goyo volcano has been active since 1994.
The police have contacted the Catalonian separatists before the day of their own vote
On Saturday, six persons were arrested in Barcelona after the sponsors of the motion for a resolution with six persons. The gods joined the opposition's motions for a resolution to celebrate the opposition of Catalonia.
The group of masked combatants who kept back from the police attacked the last eggs and powders, causing their fats to drop down on the roofs, which are usually full of tourists.
The riots would also occur later when the police were to use knives to control the bells.
Several hours ago, "I don't forget, I'm not sorry," the self-esteem supporters filed a complaint with the state's cohesive thinkers who shouted "Livue Spain!".
According to the local press, 14 mental - health professionals were helped by a doctor.
The tension continues to rise in the area of self-sustainment, even after Madrid declared it illegal on 1 October, but which the Catholics on the apartheid noted.
The voters decided that it was extremely beneficial to exercise self-determination, although the electoral activity was low, as the opposition oilers voted extensively against the expulsion.
According to the Catalan authorities, some 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to block the vote in front of the voting groups throughout the region, which led to violent clashes.
The parties to self-determination had slept in front of the voting groups at night in order to avoid any mood swings supported by the national police.
However, the statements were made, but they had to take a different course.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, who participated in a segregating opinion with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of seeing the Catholic himself.
“In the past year, one of the best moments of our life has been found.
I saw how my parents used to enjoy the opportunity to vote, but now we're confused," he said.
In spite of the important but small-scale regional elections in December last year, it has been difficult for the categories supporting Catalan ownership to maintain this year's record, since some known leaders have either gone to pay or have been held and are expected to have their part in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who records his cell phone to support the police, said that the ball was being pushed back by both sides of the politicians.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of the Catholics who have been in the review prison since last year, announced that he is participating in the European Parliament's elections next year.
"Candidacy in the European Parliament's elections is the best way to understand the failure of the restoration of democratic values and the sovereign powers of the Government of Spain," he said.
Londonderry: The man was arrested because the car framed the house
Three men were arrested at the age of 33, 34 and 39 after repeated house arrests in Londonderry.
The case found the location of Ballynagard Crescentis on Thursday at 19:30 a.m. place after the British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said damage was done to thieves and buildings.
He was also able to get a vibull at any moment.
I'm gonna hit Livingston 1 to 0 to win the Rangers.
Dolly I'm the first one to win for Livingstone.
Given Livingston's treatment of Rangers to bring Steven Gerard to his second death during the 18th game when he was the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's strike would be determined when Gary Holt grew up with a second level of Hibernian.
Gerard will be defeated in the first too far north during this period and will stand for answers on the next holy day to the Hearts of eight points from the country.
Before that, Rangers Rapid Vienna will be celebrated in the euro area on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston expanded his unconquered attack to seven games, while the captain Holt still felt the loss of taste since Kenny Miller's exchange last month.
Livingston loses the opportunity for visitors to the nerves
The team would often have had to run a bomb before the shooting took place, as if their immediate game style caused Ranger any problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts were focused on the paint, where Alan Lithgow made efforts to cover Craig Halkett's paint over the paint.
The contestants gladly allowed Ranger to play before themselves, knowing that they could cause problems when they met with visitors.
And it's also a way to figure out how to solve the problem.
Rangers created a free club and Livingston created an opportunity to play the Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga scheme, which took a ball and made it a success.
By this time the Rangers were mainly in the ball, but could not pass through protection, so the guard Liam Kelly was very calm.
The same pattern continued on the other side, although Alfredo Morelos tried to protect Kelly once more.
The Rangers, the former director of Allan McGregor, pulled Scott Pittman's spear and litgow was particularly involved in the team's follow-up to Livingstone.
The soldiers continued to arrive in Livingstone's penal area, and they managed to leave there on a continuous basis. Two of them were also directed to go for the trial of Halketti Glenn Middleton's replacement test and the other ball.
Phenomenal achievement from Livingstone – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni Station
Phenomenal radiation and result from Livingstone.
Each player was great, exceeding the total expectations of the top row.
Their game styles and players have changed since the top level, but Holt has had to be respected for how he has been beaten since his arrival.
He had so many wings.
Captain Halkett was proud to organize excellently organized protection while Menga maintained Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the game.
But the Rangers got an injection.
Despite their moderate well-being under the leadership of Gerard, this has proved to be less than the examples here.
The administration of their last ball is weak: access to the home area was only an act that could serve as an obstacle to the Rangers located in the centre of the table.
Erdogan's counter-attack in Kolnis
On Saturday (September 29th) there were both laughter and anxiety, as did the leaders of Turkey and Germany at breakfast.
President Erdogan is the last day of the anti-German visit aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have been left aside on issues relating to human rights, freedom of the press and the accession of Turkey to the EU.
Then Erdogan Kolni was directed to open a new magnificent museum.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.
The police referred to security by prohibiting the gathering of 25,000 members of the people before the mosque, but some supporters appeared close to it to see their president.
The centuries against Erdogan, of whom most of them are deaf, also made their voice heard, did not mean either Erdogan's policy or the decision of the German Government to expel the President of Turkey in his own country.
The ruling statements show that the situation in the neighborhood has been calm: some of the inhabitants of Germany welcome him as a hero, while others owe him honor as a man of self - control.
Traffic accident on the Deptford Road: The bike broke down by car as a result of a collision
In London, the car broke down a broken leg.
The event took place at Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street near the intersection of Deptford, in the vicinity of the city about 10:15 next to the British summer.
The car driver stopped and helped to give the ambulances, but the man died at the time of his birth.
It occurred a few months after the second train broke off the train about two miles [2 km] from the day after the incident at Children's Street, where the driver who drove off the train fled from the scene.
The London police said that the authorities are dealing with a man's identification and his close contact.
At the place of birth, traffic is closed and buses are turned around, driving drivers are advised to avoid the region.
Long Lartini prison: In peace, six prison officers were injured
The prison authorities reported that six prison officers were able to commit suicide in the peace of the very safe men in prison.
The peace rested on his Majesty's Long Lartine prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at 09:30 a.m. place after the British winter and has not ended yet.
One band of peace-related eight prisoners has been involved in the conduct of police officers from the authorities.
Prison officials were treated with easier appearances at birth.
The president of the Prison Service said: “The special trainees have been invited to resolve the ongoing case in the HMP Long Latin prison.
Five team members received medical help because of injuries.
We do not want any violence in our prisons, those responsible for it are given over to the police and their imprisonment can be extended."
HMP Long Lartinis is over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, he was informed that he had been taken to the hospital after he was arrested.
In October last year, however, the police were invited to prison for serious relief during which prisoners were attacked by Billions of Prisoners.
Orcaan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (can be useful in the northern regions)
Troopilic low blood pressure does not often kill Arizona, but it is likely to occur at the beginning of next week, when a bright orange Rose moves over the front shoulder of the United States, with the threat of outbreaks.
National air services have already been organised on the first and second days of emergency monitoring in West Arizona, in the southern and eastern parts of California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the offer, Rosa is heading directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the region on the first day of the winter.
The Phoenix National Weather Service ensured that “from 1950 onwards, only ten tropical cycles have been preserved from Phoenix 321.86 miles [321.86 km] of the tropical storm or low-power level!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane crossing the Arizona border of 64.37 kilometers."
The most advanced models of the national Orcanian centre predict an altitude of 5,08 to 10,16 cm, which can be extended in areas limited by the Arizona Mogollon Rim to 15,24 cm.
In other parts of the United States, including the Middle East and the Great Sea, the percentage of percentages is likely to be between 2,54 and 5,08 cm, within restricted areas up to 10,16 cm.
Rosa’s seeds can be a blessing to the coastal areas, as the region is hard to reach.
Although overcrowding is very stressful, such ice cream is likely to be beneficial as the Edela-America is governed by soil.
The U.S. root monitor says at least 40% of Arizona's equivalent may be of the second category, reported weather.com.
First of all, Rosa Baja California is over the Gulf of Mexico.
Rosa, who was still at the peak of 6.43 miles per hour [6.43 km / hr] on Sunday morning, is now 619.95 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving at a speed of 19.31 km per hour north.
The storm is related to the cooling water of the Pacific Ocean and is therefore a bit slow.
It is therefore expected that Rosa will arrive at the country of Mexico with the strength of the tropical storm on Monday or in the evening.
Some of the seeds in certain regions of Mexico may be large, with significant risks of overcrowding.
"The range from California to Sonora’s natural part can be expected for winter temperatures of between 7.62 and 15.24 cm, reaching up to 25.4 cm," reported weather.com.
Then Rosa goes over the tropical storm north of Mexico, arriving on the other side of the Arizona border on the spring of the second day as a tropical low climate that passes over Arizona and reaches the southern part of Utah on the second day.
"The main threat to Rosa or her descendants is the very strong heath in Baja California, the natural part of Sonora and the former part of the United States," said the National Orcanian Centre.
These winter conditions may cause life threatening toxic and toxic crops in the grasslands and soiled areas.
Midsomer Norton virus: four homicides
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested with a suspected murder after being found in Somerset with a 16-year-old boy.
A young boy was found guilty in the region of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 04:00 Brittany.
Ohver refers to "stabilized" in the hospital.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old man was arrested on the night of Radstock in the Avon and Somerset district, the police said.
Officials are requested to contact any person who may have a mobile phone record.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "supported" the democratic party "under the "brother and Anger"
"The support of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unbridled and unauthorized tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in his encouragement in Wheelingus West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "supported" during the process of appointing his office as a democratic party under "brother and wrath".
Kavanaugh gave his testimony before the Congress on the fourth day, breaking down Christine Blasey Ford's charges that he had been attacked several decades ago when they were legal.
He also gave his testimony to Ford at the meeting.
The President said on Saturday that "America saw the coolness, quality and comfort of Kavanaugh this day."
Judge Kavanaugh has been appointed by a vote to appoint one of our most valued legislators in public service," he told the people of West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the appointment of the office of Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of electoral activity in the Republic.
“Five weeks have left one of my most important choices in life.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm actually a candidate," she said.
"So I am at all to fight on behalf of the great candidates."
The trumpet claimed that the Democrats are on a mission whose aim is "to resist and stop".
The first main vote on the motion for a motion for a resolution by the Senate is expected to take place at a later date, according to CNN of the Heads of the Party of the Republican Party.
Thousands have been killed in Indonesia by the earthquake and tsunami, and the number of failures increases.
At least 384 people lost their lives and many were threatened when the glaciers felt at sea after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had arrived on the streets together at the beach festival in Palu, when six metres of law fell on the beach, killing a lot of people and destroying everything that remained on the road.
Tsunami next to 7.5 Magnitude of soil.
"When a tsunami occurred yesterday, people still took their actions on the coast, not running away immediately, leaving such victims," said the Indonesian disaster relief agency at the press conference of BNPB President Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Jakartas.
“Tsunami didn’t come alone, but she took cars, wages and houses with her, cleaning everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that Tsunami moved at an altitude of 800 km an hour before reaching the shore.
Some people ran out of wood to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to the center of Palu 24.
The photos published by the disaster relief agency showed several damaged buildings and floors, collapsed and collapsed walls and museums surrounded by water.
The remaining materials in the coastal area continued on Saturday.
With 2.4 million inhabitants in the region, there were hundreds of millions of farmers.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) stated in its statement that energy released after a severe earthquake was about 200 times greater than its own nuclear bomb hit in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city located along a long and narrow layer could increase the strength of Tsunami, said BPPT.
Nugroho described the damages as "industrial" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels have fallen apart.
He said that some bodies of victims were found buried under the ruins of buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 lost.
Nugroho said that the number of injuries and injuries could be greater than 300 km north of Palu, with the name Doghara, which was closer to the center of the earth.
The information received from Donghar “is completely incomplete and does not contain any information”, Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 residents in the region," said Red Cross in his statement, adding that its team and volunteers are inclined to suffer in places.
"Doing is already a tragedy that can go even worse," he said.
The authorities were criticised widely on Saturday because it did not notify the tsunami in Palu, although the authorities said that the laws reached the coast at the same time as the warning was issued.
In social media, amateur artists have seen a man on the roof of a building, warning of a tsunami approaching people who are slowly moving below today.
A few minutes later, the sailor gets to the beach, taking the house and the cars with him.
The Reuters failed to verify the correctness of the material immediately.
The Earth's and Tsunami caused a massive electrical test that prevented the link in the Palu region and made it difficult for the authorities to organize rescue work.
The military has begun sending aid flights from Jakarta and other cities, said the authorities said, but evacuaters still desperately need food and other basic work.
The airport in the city was reopened for rescue work, leaving another part closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation centres on Sunday.
Due to Indonesia's tsunami, the number of outbreaks increased by over 800.
It's very bad.
Although the World Vision workers safely arrived in the city of Palu, where there was a secret in their office in front of the showrooms, they saw funny images on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They said you saw a lot of lost houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Although the aid aid has begun in the wake of a massive disaster relief operation, it is clear from the fact that workers from foreign aid organisations have been prevented from traveling to Palu.
In accordance with the Indonesian rules, funds, equipment and aid may be sent abroad only if the place of disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“To do is still at the provincial level with disaster,” said Aulia Ariani, president of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "Okay, doing is a national disaster," we can accept international aid, but this situation has not yet been declared."
When they arrived the second night after the earthquake and tsunami, friends and families were still full of hope that their close associates would be these wonderful events that relieve the suffering of natural disasters.
On Saturday, there was an increase in channelling capacity in a small boy.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who was two days away from her mother’s corpse.
In the train of Gendon Subbandon, a team of Indonesian national airships trainers for two missing air racers in Asia, which took place in Indonesia early this month.
The others who are at the Roa Roa hotel are her students, in addition to Mr Manji.
"I have a personal burden from the señor as a crossword puzzle," he said.
Mr. Gendon spoke about how after the new expansion of the Roa Roa Hotel in the community of transangerated crossword puzzles, he gladly sent whatsAppi messages to the competitors Palu who were at the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked only by one male bird instead of two blue birds.
"I think it means that the messages didn't get there," he said.
The old took EUR 23,585,88 during the execution of the bank automation at Newport on the Levies
On Friday morning, Newport was stolen from the Levees banker's car of €23,585.88 from Brinki's employer, who was charged with the newport police department.
The car driver emptied a bank auto and prepared to bring more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press.
When a man acted, "the second man ran to the back of the Brink worker" and stole the house that was meant to be full of money.
The Witnesses saw several suspects from the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
All those who have information about the property are invited to contact the Newport police by telephone (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper takes its new name Ye
Caller Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, on Twitter, a man wrote: "Another Kanye West."
From the age of 41, West has been invited by Y for some time and a man also used the name as a signature of the eight-year-old album published in his June.
The change will find a position before her presentation by sending Saturday Night Live, where a man will probably publish his new Yandhi album.
He replaces the song by Ariana Grandet, who canceled his concert "at the time of your feelings," said the author.
In addition to the fact that doing is the shortest of the present man's performances, West has previously said that doing is of religious importance to him.
"I think "ye" is one of the most common uses of the word in the Bible, which means "jin," said West earlier, when discussing the name of his album with radio director Big Boy.
“Therefore I am you, I am ours, these are ours.
I changed my name from Kanye, meaning "this one", to Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion and everything else.
The album is more reflective than who we are."
Kanye West is not the only rapper who plays with his name.
Sean Combsi is primarily known by the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year music announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
In the past, JAY-Z has also used its name with intelligence and without it, large and small.
Mexico's AMLO policy allows us not to use civil war
During the 50th year of the blood attacks directed against scientists, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico has promised that he will never use war against civilians.
On Sunday, Lopez Obrador promised Tlatelolco Plazas that "no military service to control Mexicans will never be used".
The military attacked a peaceful declaration on 2 October 1968, killing 300 people throughout Latin America when left science movements were confirmed.
Lopez Obrador has agreed to support young people in Mexico, to pay any benefits to students and to open up more free to national universities.
He has said that lack of employment and educational opportunities leads to young people's criminal forces.
The United States should double the financing of the manufacturing agency.
"As China has become increasingly active in the field of manufacturing logistics, the United States should double the amount allocated to research in this area," said the financer and manufacturer Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after the various parts of the US government made statements concerning the manufacturing chain, although the United States does not have a general official strategy under the manufacturing chain.
At the same time, China was informed last year of its plan to be the manufacturer for the renewal of the manufacturing chain by 2030.
"The two-fold revision of the research budget of the Industrial Service Agency would be a good start, taking into account that other countries are so far behind the United States and we are acting on behalf of the next Industrial Service Agency," Lee said.
The double funding would double the probability of achieving the next major industrial utility in the United States, said Lee CNBC in this week's interview.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the manager of the company Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of the most obvious industrial suppliers of China's Face+.
In the 1980s he worked with Carnegie Mellon at the University of Technology, which won the top American Othello player. Later he was a man at the Microsoft Research Board and president of the China branch of Google.
Lee recognized the US government's previous technology competition, such as the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked what the next competition would be to help identify the following dreamers.
"The U.S. scientists must work hard to get government funding," Lee said.
"China is not the one who takes over the cartels, they are mostly businesses," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hired by coal scientists from universities in recent years to work on the manufacturing chain.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to support the efforts of the manufacturing agency.
"I think that people who have received a doctoral degree under the manufacturing license should be automatically offered a green card," said the man.
In July 2017, the Chinese National Council published a plan for the development of the following generation.
"The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China grants funding to people working in academic institutions similar to how national research funds and other government agencies give money to scientists in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," said Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established an industrial service centre, which aims to involve partners from both industry and educational institutions.
Last month, DARPA announced that it was going to fund the AI Next initiative with two million dollars.
However, the National Research Fund is currently funding over $100 million a year in research research related to manufacturing alloys.
At the same time, there was no amendment to the United States legislation aimed at creating a national safety committee for the manufacturing chain.
Macedonians vote on the change in the name of the country in their national vote
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the name of the country into the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would also be a step towards resolving the ten-stage dispute with Greece which has prevented the confirmation of statements of accession to Macedonia as a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which is the province of Macedonia, claims that its core name constitutes a requirement for this territory and has prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments of the two countries made a new name for Macedonia in June, but opponents of the people claim that it would harm the name of the Macedonian slave population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he did not intend to participate in the referendum and that the Irish campaign had raised doubts as to whether electoral activity would achieve the 50% participation required for the people's vote.
The vote asks: "Do you support Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU, in agreement with Greece?"
Supporters for the change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is a price worth paying for Macedonia, which is one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to ensure accession with organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come here today to vote for the future of our country and for young Macedonians so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said that they are following the result of the vote to make it final.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is required to be nominated.
The National Electoral Commission said that at 1300 hours there were reports of irregularities.
However, the electoral activity was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent of previous parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I have come to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted for Macedonia in Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko gave their vote on Strumica on 30 September 2018 on the change in the name of the country, which would allow them to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Assembly Hall in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared for a small table and raised a table for those who vote against the people.
"We want to belong to NATO and the EU, but we want to join our head, not through the door of the servants," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we are still wrong.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, for example China and Russia and get European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would produce more than 20 per cent of its employment investments in Macedonia.
"I believe that the majority support the change in the name, as more than 80 per cent of the citizens support membership in the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said "yes" would be "the confirmation of our future".
The results of the debate published on the first day of the Macedonian Institute of Policy Studies revealed that 30–43% of voters in the referendum are planning to take part in the election activities that are required below.
Macedonia Telma TV interviewed public that 57% of the respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them 70 percent said they would answer yes.
For the benefit of the vote, 50 percent plus one vote.
The decline in the vote would be a serious blow to the Western Government's policy after the government took over the management of May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes on a color name throughout Brighton's protection
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling felt the protection of Brighton, ensuring the victory of Manchester City 2–0 on Saturday at Etihadi Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero left his memory as if his 65th minute of play was a bit of a joke.
The Argentinian attacker passed through the Middle East at the beginning of the organisation.
He pushed through three Brighton's guards before he got out.
After that, Aguero was surrounded by four green beads.
He crossed another guard before running through a number of players at the Brighton court.
Then he threw his ball on the left where Sterling was.
The English attacker used the first shot to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his left leg to hit Brighton's locker Matthew Ryan on the right side of the network.
"Aguerol has problems with legs," said the Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
"We said he's playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We realized that he was in a hurry at the moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the first promotion in the Premier League.
That's 29 minutes ago.
Aguero got a ball in this game in Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice ball of air to Leroy Sane on the left.
You know, I got a ball hit a few times before I drove to Sterling's distance.
Sky Blues hit the ball right before it came out of Libya.
Manchester City plays at the Master's Highway with Hopeneheim on Tuesday at 12:55 Rhein-Neckari Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play happily against Rockie
When the Nationals left out of the final tournament games, there was no new reason to start.
But the fighter Scherzer hopes to do his country Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only when Rockie, who is leading NL West with one game with Los Angeles Doggers, is still hoping to win the final.
In Rockies, the Nationals won at least 5–2 games last night, but the team still wants to secure the status of its first division.
"Although we don't play anything on our behalf, we can at least try, knowing that playing in the public and with the other team in the area of Denver is probably higher than any other game I can expect this year.
Why shouldn't I want to fight here?"
The nations have not yet named the open-ended agenda since the holiday, but they are alleged to be referring to Scherzer's food in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it was to eat on the fourth day, made a heating stand and would normally be eaten on the holy day.
This best player in Washington leads 18-7, his ERA is 2,53, the number of exits 300 and the best options at this time 220 2/3.
Trump has a boost in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh at the same time, speaking about the importance of electoral activity in the Republic.
“All we have done is on a scale in November.
Five weeks before our place of residence, one of the most important choices.
It's a big deal I don't apply for, but I'm actually a candidate, so I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, extremely terrible group of democracies, and you see it taking place in front of your own eyes.
And they've decided to take back power using any means.
They don't care who hurt them, who have to drive over them in the name of power and control. The only thing they want is power and control over everything, and we don't give them it."
Democrats are in his statement that the aim is "to resist and stop".
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "hatred, jealous, arrogant and lying."
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate's Legal Commission for Democracy, who was severely beaten in public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you play this document?
So, uh, what?
No, no, no, wait – it was one of the worst examples of body language, right by the worst body I've ever seen."
The librarian party is no longer a large community.
It's not allowed for those who express their opinion
If the activists of my local party Momentum voted to understand my frustration, it wasn't surprising.
Finally, I am the last on the list of Liberal Members of Parliament to be told that you have not arrived, and this is all about expressing your opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, became part of the same treatment because he stood firm for the Jewish opposition.
In my case, I was mistakenly counted on by my understandings because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corby.
Responsive economic policy, national security and European issues that are somewhat similar to those of the leaders of the past.
In a report by the Department of Laborists of the East, Nottingham wrote that "we would like the meetings to be shared and created."
In most cases, my eight-year-old local liborist experience with the meetings of the General Assembly is exactly like that.
Today's attitude has not affected this unfortunately for most meetings, and the promise of being politically “lower and better” has been forgotten if it has never been remembered at all.
It is even more apparent that different views are not accepted in the Leiboristian Party and that any opinion which is acceptable to the Party's board is assessed.
This began immediately after Jeremy was appointed. A colleague I thought of sharing previously similar political views was now waiting for me to change my mind and take my positions which I would never have agreed otherwise, whether doing so is with national security or with the single market in the EU.
Every time I publicly stand up, regardless of what I'm actually saying, follows this scandalous social media, exaggerating my resignation, breaking the party's policy and saying I shouldn't belong to the Leiborist party.
And doing it isn't just my personal experience.
In fact, I know that I've had more than a few of my colleagues because my comments are mostly political.
I admire the competence and decision-making powers of these employees who stand up every day with sexual or racist abuse of eyes, but I never swear.
One of the most misleading views of this policy area is how levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Leiborist Party should promote a tolerance culture.
However, the fact is that we are no longer so large a community, and any change in the "untrusted" initiative or electoral rules will make the party more persistent.
I've been given a lot of advice in the last two years to keep my head in the country, talk less, and "that would be all right."
But I didn't have to do it in politics.
Since then, when I have joined the Liberian Party for 32 years, motivated by the Government's care for Thatcher, which has left my great school classroom in the face of direct harmonisation, I have tried to talk about better public services for those who need it most, acting both as members of the local authority and as ministers of the government.
I've never hidden my policy, including the last elections.
It is not possible in any case that no Nottingham East has been attacked by anyone in my political position or by the local government in the areas of non-conformity.
To all those who have promoted the movement on the lines, I would like to say that when a country is moving towards Brexit, which is damaging to housing, business and our public services, I do not understand my desire to spend my time and energy, being loyal to the leader of the Liberian mission.
But in fact, I am not the only message I have to think about Nottingham Momentum, but for my supporters, whether they belong to the Leiboristian Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not one threat of return or political consideration will not stop me from acting on behalf of what I think is in all your best interests.

Air 38–17 Melrose: Unconquered Air moves tip
Two recent events could have led to some conclusions, but there is no doubt that Ayr is worth it in this wonderful fun of Tennt's first game.
They're now alone as a team of ten in the table.
Finally, it was the team's high-level protection and better risk taking, which was the way the team won and coach Peter Murchiel's full right to be at peace.
"We've been through the game all the time and we're still winning, so of course I'm happy," he said.
Of Robin Christie Melrose, he said: "I'm thinking about Ayr's story, they used their options better than ours."
Grant Anderson's 14th game trial, which took over Frazier Climo, gave Ayry an advantage, but the Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who created the game Warriors, gave Melros a golden card that gave him the chance to pass the test that Jason Baggot had failed.
Climo increased the progress of Ayri immediately before the end of the semi-pollution, finally reaching a single-stationed half-life for Ayri between 17 and 5 years.
But Melrose was successful with the second half and Patrick Anderson's test, which took over Baggot, reduced the gap by five points.
A long delay followed by Ruarhyh Knotti due to serious injury followed by the man on the canderaam. As the game continued, Ayr progressed further thanks to Stafford McDowall's experience with Climo.
The Air Force Captain Blair Macpherson was then with a gold card, but once again, Melrose's player, Bruce Colvine, took a strong lead in his attempt to pass the test.
However, the team playing outside came back to power, and when Straan Hutchinson got a gold card to stop Climo without throwing the penalty line on the line, he put MacPherson's ball behind the advancing Ayres.
Climo gave the ball forward, as he did almost immediately after the game ended, when Kyle Rowe tried David Armstrong's castle and sent a sidewalker Gregor Henry to go out on the fifth floor of the team playing outside.
Still Game star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to be ready to establish the field of ironing services after it has been found that a man has been appointed director of the approved restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis's famous BBC television set, which he writes and shows with long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
A couple have announced that in the previous nine years, there will be a final line and that Kierna will make a new plan after Craigsang.
According to official records, he is the Director of the Apositor's Limitations of his company.
The exhibitor refused to comment on the story, but Scottish Suni started by saying that Kiernan wanted to sit in Glasgow "in the leading restaurant".
"The sea is ours": the border of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen them beyond the Black Sea
The seamen patrol the main harbor in La Paz.
The buildings of the Agency are covered by ocean ceilings.
From the Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, there is a saying: “The sea is our right.
It's our duty to restore it."
In Bolivia, there is a reminder of the coastal zone lost to Chile in the 19th century in the bloody conflict of resources. The same life is still alive.
These hopes are among the highest in recent decades, as Bolivia is waiting for five years for the decision of the International Court of Justice to be settled on 1 October.
"Bolivia has a high spirit of unity and peace, and the country looks forward to the outcome of its natural distribution," said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
A number of Bolivians across the country look at the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens, hoping that the Hague Court will benefit Bolivia, following which Chile has been obliged to hold negotiations with Bolivia for the last several decades to give its own way to the sea.
Bolivia's charismatic former President Evo Morales, who is awaiting the next year's counter-attack to re-election of the office, is very much in line with the first day's decision.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific," he complained at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that Bolivia’s case is unlikely to benefit from the vote, or if it would turn out to be very small.
The United Nations Office in the Netherlands is unable to clear the territory of Chile and has provided that it does not determine the outcome of the negotiations possible.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice is reduced only six months after the hearing of the final statements indicates that the action was not a "problem case", said international law expert Paz Zárate.
And in the long run, further reasons for Bolivia may have improved the situation for the last four years.
"The problem of access to the sea has been addressed by the current authorities of Bolivia," Zárate said.
The moral war has lost the rest of Chile's charity, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their negotiations at some point, but after all this is extremely difficult.
Two countries have not exchanged their assets since 1962.
The only President, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, who is the representative of the Bolivian Haagis, came back to the view that the decision-making process was inappropriately rapid.
The first day gives Bolivia "the opportunity to start a new era of relations with the state of Chile" and the opportunity "to end 139-year-long divorces with mutual use," he said.
Calzadilla also rejected the fact that Morales, who is still one of the famous presidents of Latin America, uses the sea issue to express political conclusions.
"Bolivia never promises to access the Pacific near its right," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to get through the past."
North Korea said that nuclear release will not take place until the United States can trust the United States
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his people would never give up nuclear weapons at the first time if Washington could not be trusted.
This Saturday at the UN General Meeting.
He called on the United States to look at the promises given by the competitors' heads of State at Singapore's summit.
He will comment on the case when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears almost to be re-initiating nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Uni.
Ri says that the US continues its restrictions and the refusal to stop the war with Korea will put North Korea under control.
Washington is aware of such a statement when Pyongyang doesn't get the first important in the direction of the same weaponization.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there has been widespread scepticism, according to which Pyongyang plans to seriously release a weapon that the State is likely to have the only chance to secure its own security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree to a second Kim and Trump summit.
The Paris Mosquitos bring to the viewer a series of massive chapters that will bring to the buyers of their neighborhoods
If you want to increase your copper collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you no longer need to search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought in their 2019 summer summer season a series of four-year-old masterpieces that covered the Paris monuments.
The high and unprofessional cubes are this summer’s mouse through Instagram and these designers have sent their legged creatures to the molluscs.
Valentino's tiptée was an oversized beeze cube covered by models, which was decorated with a wide range.
Some of the other superior clothing items included jewellery, cotton bars, and overall pineapple pineapples, but their purpose should not be to warm up.
Tom Browne also showed the choice of both masks, doing it right in time before Halloween.
Most of the colorful masks were assembled so that they remembered more Hannibal Lecter than high-end.
One part of the creature was mentioned with airtight and spring, while the other mentioned frozen ice cream.
And if you're going to keep up with superstar molluscs, you're lucky.
The poor predict that too many obstacles can reach those who are near you.
The huge cubes are coming right up to La Bomba, which is a 60-centimetre-wide ogrebar, which has been seen in all the hearings from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A large cultural brand created by a largely unprofessional cyberspace created by the social media sent to the molluscs another great work — a wave of waves, which is almost as large as this heavy bike model.
Tumeoranž raffiakokt, which has a ruffy nose and white skin, was at the peak of the 2019 rivers collection in Jacquemuse La Riviera in Paris.
Listen-style Luke Armitage told the FCC: "I look forward to seeing large cubes and sunglasses the next summer. Since the designer has published so much impact, it would be difficult to avoid the demand for excessive clothing items."
John Edward: Language centre is important to the world’s citizens
The special schools of the Shoto have been held in academia at the presentation of academia and continued in 2018 with the following eye-opening examinations, which strengthens personal and joint success in sports, art, music and other community enterprises.
These schools, which total over 30,000 students throughout Scotland and represent the Scottish Special Schools Council (SCIS), are trying to provide their students and their parents with the best services.
The aim of private schools is to prepare your students for further and higher education, their chosen lives and their place as citizens of the world.
As a education sector that can create and implement a climate-adjusted learning programme, we see that modern languages are constantly known and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “When you talk to a person in a language he can understand, it’s good for him.
When you talk to her in her mother tongue, it'll reach her heart."
Doing so is a strong reminder that we can only support English if we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's fresh results show that there are languages at the table table where there is the highest rate of examination in private schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who learned sign language had a high result A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received the same price in Mandarin A, 72% in German, 69% in French and 63% in Spanish.
This shows that Shoto's private schools support the network as an essential skills that children and young people need in the future without any doubt.
The languages now contained in the choice of teaching materials are as well as those of STEM (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in private schools and other schools.
A study carried out in 2014 by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills showed that for reasons why workers find it difficult to find free workers, 17% responded to the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language will become increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for future work.
While the expected job offers require language skills, such skills are essential in a global world.
In spite of the choice of careers, learning another language gives people a real advantage in the future, since language diversity is vital.
The ability to communicate directly with nationals of foreign countries gives a wide range of people a sense of competition.
In 2013, more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom were interviewed by YouGoi, according to which 75% of the respondents were not responding online enough to keep the conversation on track. The only language that the participants had been bilingual was 15% in French.
Therefore, funding for language learning is now important for children today.
In many languages, especially in the languages of developing countries, learning gives children a better chance of finding a good job.
Every school in Scotland is taught different languages.
Many schools focus longer on classical contemporary languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered the most important in the United Kingdom in the year 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Despite the child’s interests, private schools have always had the opportunity to choose between several languages taught by experts in their field.
Special schools are dedicated to offering such a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve success regardless of what the future will bring them.
It can no longer be said that in a global business environment, languages are extremely important for the future of the country, so it must also be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should truly be considered "an international centre of communication".
Private schools continue to offer young Scottishs the choice, diversity and diligence.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Shot Special Schools Council.
LeBron does his Lakers Debt on San Diego's Christmas Day
The natives don't have to wait to see LeBron James making his debut in Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton reported that James is playing in the open-air game against the San Diegos on Sunday.
But the number of minutes of his game is still to be determined.
"It's over one and less than 48," said the official website of Walton Lakers.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell security that James is probably playing the number of minutes he's probably reading.
The trainer who took place last week asked James about his plans for the sixth premier of Lakers.
"I don't need my career at the current stage of the pre-school game to warm myself up," he said.
The event of the North-West Virginia election campaign, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching his election campaign event series tonight in Wheelingus West Virginia.
The first five campaign events planned for the next week, including stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
At the same time as the confirmation vote is pending until Trump, who is appointed to the Office for Freedom of the Court of Justice, tries to increase his support for the prior intermediate options, as the Republican class threatens to lose control of the Congress following the vote in November.
What time is it that is taking place in West Virginia today and how is it viewed on the Internet?
The trumpet event in Wheelingus West Virginia will take place on Saturday night, 29 September 2018 at 19:00 p.m. by noon.
Trumpe-Virgina campaign event can be viewed on the Internet via YouTube via flight.
It is likely that Trump will talk about the week's sessions of President Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court, which turned into a very serious case of sexual misconduct. At the same time, the Senate's confirmation vote has been suspended for a week until the FBI is investigating the matter.
However, the main objective of the campaign is to help new growth to gather in the republics, which are facing difficult choices in November.
Thus, President Trump said that the next five weeks' event is aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters when the republics are trying to protect and extend them to the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"The control of the Congress is so important for the president's day-to-day order that Trump rides into the chaos of the electoral campaigns in many countries as soon as possible," said the President of the Trump campaign, who did not want to mention his name.
Today's campaign tour, which is planned to take place at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheelingus, can bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and also get feedback from Pittsburgh's media," reports West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday is the second time that Trump visits West Virginia. This is the country where he received more than 40 percent of the votes of the voters in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Western Virginia Republican syndicated Patrick Morriseyd, who is responsible for leading the elite on the basis of the issues.
"For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the President has come to encourage his results," said political scientist Simon Haeder of the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team participates in the race of nerves, keeping hopes ahead of Sunday alone
After the three-part session, the games that took place on Saturday afternoon were just what Ryder Cup needed.
The turning point on the stage is completely out of sight in the game, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this here.
So where would they think is the turning point now?
"They led with six points, which have now received four, so I think I can think of it as a little turning point," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has a good advantage, this is clear because it is guided by four points and the game is still 12 points.
Spieth says Americans know they don't have enough wind in the wind, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each got three points in four.
Spieth has been both walking and walking as far as Green and showing examples.
These coming rounds were always turned into rounds, hiding a certain point that would have led to the fourth round of the machine after he and Thomas were in two countries.
His fighter, who won the match on the 15th, sent a similar message that showed him that the Americans are not out of the race yet.
"You just have to play with the focus and worry about your machine," said Spieth.
It's the only thing players can do.
18 doors to keep track.
The only players who have more points after the last two days than Spiethl and Thomas are Ryder Cup's outstanding stars in Francesco Molina and Tommy Fleetwood
Europe's funny, but a couple of loved ones are four and nothing can be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't miss Saturday after Saturday at Bogey, avoiding bogeys also on Saturday morning, Friday at Friday and back at nine in the morning.
This game and the way in which their energy flows into so many peoples, from there back there, strengthens the view that players with whom they will fight on Christmas Day and that when the sun rises over Le Golf National, Europe is not possible to confirm the victory of the most famous players such as Fleetwood or Molinari.
Both are preferable for different doors at the same time.
However, some of Europe's prosperity is predictable.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did Sergio Garcia, a four-and-a-half-a-half-year-old, quick work when a man joined a couple with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two times in the first nine years of his life had been so deeply moved by the Spanish and Russian that they had no hope of getting out of it.
But on Saturday, there's no one who can help you out of August.
Four-pale and pairs are extremely likely to look closely at just the relationship between couples, the advice given to each other, without getting any advice and because of how the way can be changed with time.
Europe has played a better role as a team so far and has lived with strong progress for the last few days, but this four-session showed that the United States team is engaged in fighting nerves, with some, especially Americans, having doubts.
European residents of Ryder Cup on the last day 10-6
In the last day of Ryder Cup, Europe will be able to move between 10 and 6 ahead of the United States of America after the four-day football and pair games.
A great Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led two hits in front of Tiger Woods to raise their old score in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorni, the European side who contributed two years ago to the maintenance of the lost car in Haseltine, ruled after the fall of the American side in the morning at four-pillar, won a series of 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the match game, winning two games, but they couldn't compensate for the lack of pay.
Jim Furyki's side needs eight points on Sunday for the 12 single games to keep the ball.
Fleetwood is the first European starter who won four points. Along with Molinari, who is called Molinari after this tragic exchange into Moldova, they are the second couple who have won in Ryder Cup in their fourth opening game four points.
Having destroyed the four-pillars Woods and Patrick Reed, they continued with the same spirit, fighting Woods and the American beginning Bryson Dechambeauveelg determined: 5-4.
Woods, who fired himself on Saturday through two games, showed an accidental show, but now lost his 29-ball and pairing game 19, getting seven losses.
Justin Rose, who had been speaking for four days in the morning, went back with partner Henrik Stanson, winning 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who is in the world's first and third locations.
In Europe this has not been successful, although the competition has been viewed as a pleasant and winding moment in the south of Paris.
The three-time superintendents Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set two points for the American Saturday.
They won a four-ball firm victory 2-1 over Spain Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, later back and won the match with Paulter and Rory McIllroyd 4-3, losing two openings.
Only two times in Ryder Cup's history, the team has come back from a four-point shortage, going into single games, although the owner needs only a week to keep the Foryk prison.
Although it seems that two days better than another place, after the holiday, it seems like they will not succeed.
North Korea says "no case" they don't make themselves a weapon because of lack of confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the UN on Saturday that the continued restrictions increased their distrust of the United States and that the State is not going to release its nuclear arsenals on the one hand under such conditions.
At an annual meeting of the World Organisation, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has taken "significant good practices" over the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear and projectiles, the detonation of nuclear testing sites and the non-proliferation of nuclear technology.
"But we don't see that the United States would have responded," he said.
"Untrusted outside the United States there is no security in our country, and in any way we do not agree to make ourselves the first weapon on the one hand."
While Ri has repeatedly heard complaints about the “progressive” approach to Washington’s approach to nuclear war, which is based on the fact that North Korea is being helped when it comes to taking steps, it seemed important in his statement that it did not fall back on one side of the counter-terrorism, as it has done in the past in Pjongjang.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Uni and Donald Trump on 12 June for the first time by the US President and the North Korean leader at a summit in Singapore, when Kim agreed to move towards "resisting the Korean side of nuclear resistance" and Trump agreed to security assurances for North Korea.
North Korea has wanted to officially end the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also faced challenges to mitigate the severe international restrictions imposed on North Korea.
"The US requires "the first nuclear discharge" and increases the burden of restrictions in order to achieve their objective strictly, even in response to the declaration of end-of-war," said Ri.
“I understand that the restrictions on our birth are a dream to people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that the continued restrictions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention Kim and Trump's second summit plan, which the U.S. leader stressed this week.
Instead, the Minister raised a meeting between three Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae in the last five months and added: "If South Korea had one party to the issue of nuclear resistance, not the United States, it would not have reached such a compromise."
On the other hand, Ri’s words were different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that the return to the US country of rockets was inappropriate after Mr. Paha President Trump called Kim’s suicide mission a ‘racetmaker’.
Today, thanks to North Korea last year to completely destroy the threated Trump of the UN's Kim sky for its encouragement to stand in the same direction, but in addition that there is still much more to be done and that restrictions must remain in force until the end of North Korea's nuclear age.
On the third day, Trump said that he lacked time to do so, saying: "Will it take two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should support the measures taken by Pyongyang.
At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The entry into force of the Security Council's restrictions must continue in force and without delay until we can fully and definitively confirm nuclear discharge."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased its restrictions on North Korea in order to prevent the financing of Pongyong nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
The trial was held in Riga by the United Nations General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip wasn't going very well.
After meeting with the Jewish Pyongyang, he said that our progress had been made after what he understood in North Korea only within a few hours of the "guangster requirements" being exhausted.
North Korea agreed this month to launch rockets and nuclear-computer when the United States would implement "responsive measures".
He said Kim had told him that under the "responsive measures" he had seen security guarantees approved in Singapore and the normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to clean up enough
This year, Harvard University offers a new course where students have to sleep more to fight a growing aggressive culture, which is taught in the caffeineic nighttime lessons.
Students who love the best university academics in the world are often helped when doing so is based on the principles of self - care.
Professor Charles Czeisler of this course, Harvard Medical School, and Brighami and Professor of Women's Hospital, believe this to be the first real estate in the United States.
He was excited about the creation of a course when he spoke about how sleep disorders affect learning.
“At the end of the day, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I still talking about it, at my last year of school?’
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of dreaming - it was my fault," he explained to the Telegraph.
The course that was first planned this year will explain to students how good dreams will help academics and sports outcomes and will also help improve their overall well-being.
The professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Director of Health at the University said Paul Barreira decided to take the course after it was found that students were in serious sleepiness during the week.
The hourly course covers a number of tasks to be carried out.
In part, the image is presented from the community. There students can click on coffeeboards, cardboards, sports stars and books and explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sleeplessness affects sports results and the normal importance of sleep.
The second part explains to participants how long-term sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, amnesia and smallpox.
The Charter of the University of olive trees, along with the corresponding symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this does not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just like you have the right to know how smoking cigarettes affects health," added Professor Czeisler.
In his statement, there is still a threat of night learning marathons, adding that modern technology and growing stress students are more likely to mean that sleeplessness is a growing problem.
"Ensuring a good enough quality dreamer should be a student's "secretary" that combats stress, fatigue and anxiety," he added. "It even helps against rising body weight, as sleep makes the brain's hunger system, but it makes people always hungry."
From California, 19-year-old professor of chemical and physical biology Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler create a course, taking part in one of his classes last year, his first Harvard year.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and moved him to help create a university course.
Next, he would like all graduates to pass through a similar training programme before joining a competitive authority.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up their home language for both sleep and escape, and be aware of the harmful effects of electronic screens and LED lighting, as this may damage their daily routine and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mega stores Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered a series of bad game results when Dolly Menga, who sent by Steven Gerard, won 1-0 wins in Livingstone.
Ibrox's side hoped to get his first visit from the February 4-1 St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerard's second losses as leader in 18 games, leaving eight points with Ladbrokes Premiership's head of Hearts.
Mega cut her money seven minutes before the pool and the strong preparation of Rangers was unable to recover from it.
The Rangers therefore descends to six, Livingston rises to three, leaving only one line below Hibernia.
The problem for Rangers is not yet over, because their attacker Calum Spence needed a major treatment after he got infected with a apparently detached object.
Gerard made eight changes, which led to the passing of Air and Beth Fred Cupi's semifinal.
At the same time, however, Livi 11 went on to the same time that took the point of Heardsilt last week and he would have been happy to see how well-trained boys did not give up on their opponents every step.
Rangers might have been more powerful, but Livingston did a lot more with his ball.
They'd have had to break the money by the second opening, when Menga's first exchange sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregori's wallet, but the semi-defencer didn't use his option.
The great Keaghan Jacob's release was then found Captain Craig Halketti, but his protector Alan Lithgow was able to do only a large-scale strike post in the back of the post.
Yes, the Rangers gained control, but they have more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt that he should have received a sentence when he was in jail with Steven Lawles at the 15th minute of the game, Judge Steven Thomson was not satisfied with the charges of the Columbian player.
Rangers managed to make only two shots on the first half of the day, but the former Ibroxist Liam Kelly didn't feel any concern about Lassana Coulibary or Ovie Ejaria's incident.
Although Liv could break the game rules for 34 minutes, no one can blame them for doing so because of their prejudices.
Still, Rangers couldn't handle Jacobs' deep-fashioned presentation.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher threw a ball into Scott Robinson, who kept peace and chose Menga who just took the plan to the end.
Gerard worked in the middle of the exchange of Coulibaly Ryan Kent. This exchange almost stopped when the superintendent stopped Morelos, but rememberable Kelly started to stop him from his place.
But Livingston continued to entertain visitors to play exactly the kind of game that suits them where Lithgow and Halkett fixed up a long ball.
At the end of the day, it might have been possible to promote its leadership, but McGregor stood firm, blocking Jacobs before Lithgow broke his neck with a big knife.
Mr. Ranger's deputy, Glenn Middleton, once again asked for a prison sentence when he and Jacob got up, which Thomson didn't like again.
Almanah: The inventor of the Geiger list
And now on our Sunday Morning Almanahhis: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago and LOENDADES ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The operation was with an invention that finally produced five devices known as Geiger's logger.
Based on this knowledge, Geiger also started pop culture as in the 1950 film "Coronado Times", where they were among the most unlikely of the scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What else is this?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger accountant used for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
It is possible to hear the sound of different atoms separated from the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans said, "Don't tell me, it's only going to happen now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his name is still alive.
The new small vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the pettur gland
New small vaccines can teach the immune system to "see" pettur pills and kill them
The vaccine teaches that the immune system is aware of petturic cancer as part of treatment
The method includes the taking of immune cells from the patient and changing their cells in the laboratory
Then they can be seen for many active substances with joint white and are injected back
The vaccine is shown to be multiplicity in patients with different active substances.
In one woman who was treated with a vaccine to teach contact the immune system with pettur cells, her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immune cells from the patient. These cells are modified in the laboratory to allow them to "see" white, which has spread to different HER2 molluscs and then re-inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Institute of Minorities in Bethesdas Maryland, U.S.A., explained: "Our results show that we have a very complex vaccine."
HER2 "leads the growth of many minor types", including breast, thigh, hip and colorectal glands, Professor Berzofsky explained.
Similar approaches have been used in certain types of leukaemia treatment.
Kanye West started with Trumpi's support, carrying the SNL directly MAGA shirt.
It didn't go very well.
You will be able to study Saturday Night Live at the Kanye West, after which he gave a resounding speech, which he thanked President Donald Trump of the United States and announced his candidacy to the same office in 2020.
After that night his third song, named Ghost Town, and where he played the song with the book Make America Great, he launched a campaign against democracies and repeated his support for Trump.
"I've talked so much to white people who ask me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racer?"
"If I were so worried about racism, I'd already been out of America," he said.
The SNL started the device with Matt Damon, where Hollywood heard jokes about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Committee of Judges on the alleged sexual violence of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this part of the facility did not go into ethics, West education courses were loaded into Chris Rock's social media.
It's not clear whether Rock tried to look at West Post.
He also complained to the West public that he was behind the scenes in connection with his music.
“They shot me behind the desk.
They said I wouldn't go there.
They shot me!
And then they say I'm upset," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the ground? I'm going to put my Superman's helmet on, because it means that you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love."
At least two times, his comments revealed the evil of viewers, and it seemed that the SNL team was suffering. According to the variety, one person said: "The whole studio became a mortal."
The West had been released at the last moment to replace Ariana Grande, because as an ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
The West surprised many with the song “I Love It” that he appeared as a Perrier bottle during the presentation.
The West received support from the conservative group TPUSA led by Candace Turner, who said: "One of the guarantees to the soul: DO NOT SHOULD YOU SHOULD SHOULD SHOULD SHOULD SHOULD SHOULD SHOULD SHOULD SHOULD SHOULD."
But Chief Karen Hunter said that West was just "the one who he is, and it's completely amazing."
"When I decided to assist MITTE (by buying my music or clothing or by supporting his "art") someone who believes in and spreads a harmful world view to my society.
He's free.
Like us," he added.
Before you were sent, a rapper on Twitter reported that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the end of Kanye West."
He's not the first singer to change his performance, following Diddy, who's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also, rapper Snoop Dog has named Snoop Lion and, of course, modern-day musical Prince who has changed his name into a symbol.

The sound of the troon game Kit Harrington does not approve of the fun of masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his remarkable role in the violent role of Jon Snowin HBO in the central fantasy series of Troones.
But an indicator (31) throws down an aggressive angle stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be karma.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that "something's gone wrong" and raised the question of how to solve the problem of fun masculinity during #MeToo.
The guy who recently married his throne game with Rose Leslie (31) admitted that he feels "highly awake" that this problem needs attention.
“I now feel quite personally that we have gone wrong with men wherever we go,” he said.
"What have we taught men when they grow up with regard to the problem we now see?"
Kit believes that the rise in mass masculinity of the whale is partly the crime of television as it shows global trends.
He continued: “What have you been taught?
What is taught on television and on the Internet gives young boys the feeling that they must be just like they want to be men.
I think it's really one of the biggest questions of our time - how to change it?
'Cause obviously something's gone wrong for young people."
He also acknowledged that after the end of the series the following summer, he never participated in any Troonies game, saying he is “one-sided with his warriors and horses”.
Since November, Kit Sam Shepardi has been involved in restoring True West, which speaks of creating a filmmaker and his vicious brother.
The speaker recently announced that he must meet with his wife Rose for the best thing about the Troon game.
“I met my wife at this meeting, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” she said.
Rose played with Emmy in the fantasy series Ygritte, the other actor loved Jon Snow.
A couple of marriages in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS by 14%.
According to healthcare professionals, more than 820,000 people suffer from this disease.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have occurred since sex, in the past.
In general, HIV spread some of China’s contaminated blood circulation .
However, in this way, the number of people infected with HIV has declined almost zero, while health officials in China confirmed the conference held in the province of Yunnan.
Annually, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT names is likely to be high.
However, because of the values of the state, studies show that 70-90% of men who are sexually active are eventually married to women.
Many transmissions of diseases are related to insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has agreed to use general access to HIV medicines to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to broadcast the data of the GOP Senator, saying that doing is "hazardous lies" and "water claims"
On Saturday, U.S. representative Maxine Waters came to the understanding that his employer had posted personal data from three U.S. senators' websites to Wikipedia.
Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims spread ultra-peripheral trolleys and their websites.
"The choices, lies and even more burning lies," Waters said in his Twitter release.
The information published was alleged to contain the addresses and telephone numbers of United States senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both from Uthana).
Information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. It had been posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate panel regarding allegations of sexual harassment by the State Court of Justice against Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was released shortly after three senators had interviewed Kavanaugh.
Old websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the mail, was linked to the Waters Office and issued information from the employee under Waters, reported Hill.
"This unfounded claim is complete and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My employees whose personality, personal data and safety are threatened by their fraudulent and false claims are not in any way responsible for this information.
This unreasonably false claim is complete and irreversibly false."
Water's release was quickly calculated on the Internet, including one of the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleisher.
"This pursuit comes from anger," Fleisher wrote.
“This means that he has feelings that are not appropriate for Congress members.
If someone is accused of something they haven't done, they can't get angry.
They mustn't be trots.
They must not question the motive of the offender.
They must remain calm."
Fleisher showed a similar reaction to the criticism of the Waters Democrats, Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused of being too angry during the four-day hearing.
The candidate for religious classes, Omar Navarro, who is candidate for the mid-term elections at Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true," he replied.
In its statement, Waters said that his office had warned "the relevant authorities of the Agency and the law enforcement authorities in connection with their fraudulent claims."
"Let's do everything to explain the perpetrators," he continued, "and that they would rightly be responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Film Johnny English Strikes Review Again - reserved Rowan Atkinson spy parody
It is now common to look for Brexit's meanings in all new British films, and it seems to be particularly appropriate in the early years of the Johnny English Code, which started with Johnny English and was followed by the renewal of Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Is smiling on the subject when we are clearly stupid in the new export option of the country?
In any case, an uncompliant Johnny English has allowed him to do things again in his own way - and that this widespread co-foundation is intended for film-producing non-English.
Of course, it is with a secret agent who, despite his visual pretension-glamour, is almost mentioned by Clouseau'd, by Mr. Bean and by some fact, who gave the award of Chariots of Fire to London for the opening of the 2012 Olympics.
It is also based on the fact that it is on a journey and an international secret at the Atkinson, which has been played once in the forgotten Barclaycard television, which leaves only behind the scenes.
This last JE movie has only one or two nice moments.
I liked the approach of Johnny English to the helicopter when he threw off the central rails and the helicopters, and then he turned his back on his bike.
It shows Atkinson's ability to make physical comedy, but humour seems to be less subtle and strangely superior, especially when "true" spy movies such as 007 and Mission Impossible offer their own comedy.
It seems that this tumor is more thought-out to children than to adults, and for me, there are no steps taken by Johnny English to be both apparent and focused on Atkinson's dark movies in Beanina.
Now there is an ongoing assumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyberspace has become a web site for British over-secret spies, revealing all British secret police personnel, making it a major fraud to the local agent - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last challenge for the Prime Minister, who is persistent and difficult to deal with under the burden of political non-raciality: Emma Thompson does this excellently for Teresa-May, but the manuscript does not have much to do with it.
Her mentors recommend that since all active spies are at risk, she should call back someone who has retired.
And it means Johnny English who now works as a schoolmaster in one of the most famous institutions, teaching secrets how to be a secretist: here are some good things about where English offers the School of Rock type spy school.
English will be aired in an extraordinary way back to Whitehall and he will be reunited with his former long-term partner Bough, who will play Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, where Vicki Pepperdine's gifts are seriously damaged.
So Batman and Robin, the shames of his Majesty's secret service are again on the move, meeting Olga Kuralenko's beautiful wife, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is risking falling under the arm of a charismatic technical billionaire. The product claims that it can solve all the British computers: lucky Jason Volta, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start with their summer vacations: hiding themselves as promoters, they come straight to the French restaurant; they create chaos, they shut down Volta's luxury management board; and English runs away when she tries to use the virtual reality complex to get to know Volta's inside.
In this last section, there is no use of any pillars, but both in love and in turquoise and it is, in all respects, the children's TV mouse.
Over the middle class.
And as for other Johnny English films, I used to wonder: isn't the British film industry really giving Rowan Atkinson a role that would be fair for his talent?
The working party does not prepare a plan where the British work four days a week, but they are paid for five days
Jeremy Corby's Working Party has considered a reverse plan that provides for the British to work four days a week, but they will be paid for five days.
The party would like the company's transfers to the rescued workers through the artistic noise revolution (AI), giving them one additional day free of charge.
This would be a three-day shift for workers, but they'd get the same pay.
According to the source, this idea would be compatible with the economic plan of the party and therefore the State is planning to call for the benefit of workers.
The fourth working week has been approved at the Union Congress on Trade in order to prevent workers from using a changing economy.
The working party’s source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a preliminary review will be made known before the end of the year.
"This is not going to take place at work, but on the fourth working week there is an effort which is appropriate to bring the party closer to economic balance for the benefit of both the workers and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support such ideas because the Red Party also agreed during its 2017 election campaign on Thursday.
However, efforts are not currently supported as a whole by the Labour Party.
The Labour Party's president said: "Fourth working week there is no party's policy and the party does not discuss it."
Agent John McDonnell used a conference last week to clarify his view of a socialist turn in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to take the power back from the community companies 'pretty management' and 'profit service providers'.
The plans of the shareholders also mean that current shareholders of water companies should not be able to recover from their full share, as the Labour Party could make “major” estimates in relation to the value that is recognised.
He confirmed his plan to put employees in the management of companies and to create own funds to pay 10% of private-sector employees their own capital rather than to provide annual contributions up to EUR 561,65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about "60 Minutes" whether the FBI study can change their mind
The investigation of the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI has led to at least one week's final vote in the Court of Justice and raises the question whether the findings of the Bureau may affect the termination of the support of the senators from the Republic.
In the debate on Sunday you will be asked "60 Minutes" by Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, co-founder Scott Pelley of the republics.
Kennedy seemed open as his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“I said I was going to the hearing, and I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were filed and asked, "Did you do this?"
He was decisive, sure and consistent."
The sound of the graham appears to be on the rocks.
"I am confident in my decision with regard to Brett Kavanaugh and could only change it in a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know how this happened, but I know that Brett went so powerful," said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all whom he named were unable to confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see anything new coming."
What is the global citizen festival Global Citizen Festival, and has it helped to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, the annual music event will be held at the New York Global Citizen Festival, which has a very memorable audience and the same memorable goal: to lose poverty from the world.
Now, seven times, the Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Lawn area not only enjoying such songs as Janet Jackson, Card B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the real purpose of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the global poverty project Global Poverty Project. It is being done with an international legal group that hopes to end poverty by continuously increasing the number of people fighting it.
In order to get an event-free ticket (if you do not want to pay for the VIP ticket), concerters had to perform several tasks or voluntary activities, send an e-mail to some world leader, call or do something else important to help raise awareness of their objective in terms of poverty eradication.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when it is 12 years old to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert is a real way to convince them to do what they want or is it just a series of clicks where people feel they're doing something important by signing a statement on the Internet or by security?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered its supporters with more than 19 million "activities" in an effort to achieve several different objectives.
In line with this, these measures have helped world leaders to inform more than $37 billion of their commitments and policies, which affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group referred to 390 obligations and notifications resulting from their activities, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds guaranteed have been directly affected by around 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the partnership of investors and developers living in the United Kingdom The Power of Nutrition, which has been committed to "helping children to make full use of all their capabilities", allowing Rwanda to grant $35 million to help the country end its deficit after having received more than 4700 guarantees from Global Citizen.
"The Government of the United Kingdom, the donors, the national governments and global citizens, like you, are supported by a historical comment on social injustice," said The Power of Nutrition, President Tracy Ullman, during the London concert in April 2018.
The group also informed that after more than 5,000 activities called for improvement in the diet of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced the funding project The Power of Nutrition, which will reach up to 5 million women and children in the area of nutrition.
In response to one KKK on its website, which asks, "What makes you think we can end the poverty of exclusion?"
Global Citizen replied: “It’s a long and hard way - sometimes we fall and fail.
But as there are great civil rights and divisive movements ahead of us, we are confident of our success because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Card B, Janelle Monée are only a few actors who sit on this year's event in New York, leading Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the sea “acts” to prevent Russia’s Ministry of Energy exports
According to Washington Examiner, Washington may, if necessary, use its own seabed to avoid the detection of the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East, has been published by US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that Russia's participation in Syria, particularly when it acts at the request of the legitimate government, is the future of the new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to exchange energy as they do in Eastern Europe, South Europe," he said.
And the officer says there's a way and the means to solve it.
"The United States of America has this opportunity to ensure that maritime lines are open and, where necessary, blocked so as to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he added.
The Zinke statement was addressed to the participants in the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, which is a non-profit company that represents the USA's "energy consumer" vote.
He went to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice between Iran and Russia is more or less, capacity-building and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "one-trip pole", whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements will come when, as a result of the Government of Trump, there is still an increase in exports of land to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much easier option for European consumers.
To that end, the officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany itself to remove the "immortal" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, in Trump's words, transformed Berlin Moscow into "prison".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar North Stream 2 pipelines twice as much as 110 billion cubic metres of existing pipeline power are purely an economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington’s direct response to the project has been given only for economic reasons and is examples of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a difficult means of advertising and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," said Minister of Energy of Russia Aleksandr Novak in September of Moscow at a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry.
The U.S. has received back work from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Organisation, the German Industrial Union (BDI), called on the United States to withdraw from EU energy policy and Berlin and from Moscow bilateral agreements.
"I have a big problem when a third country is involved in our energy equipment," said the President of the German Union (BDI), Dieter Kempf, after the recent meeting of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considered to be the president's candidate in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that he considered the mid-election to be a serious candidate.
At Hollyoke's headquarters in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed his candidature.
"The women have time to go to Washington and improve our corrupt government and this also includes the first issue," he said in The Hill.
"After a serious vote on 6 November, I consider myself a presidential candidate."
Warren also commended President Donald Trumpi for his actions, saying that it would “take the country in the wrong direction.
"I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," he said.
Warren has published a criticism from Trump and its top candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In line, Warren said: "Of course we need to vote before the FBI's investigation."
However, the fourth-day questionnaire showed that most Warren did not think that he should apply for his election in 2020.
According to the Suffolki University Political Research Centre/Boston Globe, 58% of Moscow's "probably" voters considered that the senator should not be candidateised.
32% supported such candidacy.
The questionnaire showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidate, 38% supported possible candidacy and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in connection with the possible candidacy of 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Bident and Senator Bernie Sanderst.
Biden said he's officially decided to be a janitor, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin participates in the collection of Donald Trump Track Palini PTSD
Track Palin (26) was awarded for the year's recruitment from September to September.
He was arrested on Monday night for a domestic violence case and was charged with the crime.
"What my son lives through, what he's going through when he comes back, I can join other families who are aware of the consequences of PTSD and the damage our soldiers are suffering," he told the public at the gathering of Donald Trump in future October.
I called on my son to be arrested "in an emergency room" and said with regard to his son and other military veterans that "they will come back in a different way, they will come back as cartoons, they will come back to think whether there is sufficient respect for what the soldiers and the planes and all the other combatants have given to the country."
He was arrested on the first day of his arrest in Wasila Alaska and Wasilla, the president of the police department, Dan Bennett, said he was accused of female violence in the home country, of interference with the report of the Home Affairs Department, and of armed violence in his own face.
18 countries and Colombia are fighting new asylum policies
Eight countries and Colombia support legal challenges to a new US policy that prohibits victims of asylum who flee from power or domestic violence.
The representatives of 18 countries and the region presented a brief statement by the Court of Justice in Washington to support the policy of challenger-related asylum seekers, reported NBC News.
The applicant’s full name was Grace v. Session, which the American Civil Liberties Union submitted in August did not appear.
The woman said that her associate "and the sons of her violent gangs" abused her, but U.S. officials did not accept her asylum application on 20 July.
He was arrested by Texas.
Grace's national lawyers described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as a country that produces a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, with a major problem of power and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy was reworded by the 2014 Appeals Council for Refugees, which allowed non-documented immigrants to run away from their home country to submit asylum applications.
Mr. Karl Racine, Chief Prosecutor of the Colombian Region, stated in a recent statement that the new policy "existes ten years of national, Union and international law".
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be resolved in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application and this requirement violates the principle," said the Court’s brief statement.
Lawyers also argued in short notice that the ban on entry into the United States is detrimental to the economy by saying that they are likely to become businesses and "provide the necessary labour force".
In June, the Chief Prosecutor of the Jeff Session ordered immigration judges to no longer provide shelter for victims of domestic abuse and violence.
"The asylum application is available to those who leave their home country because of fear of racial, religious, national or certain social group or political opinion," said the Session in its communication of 11 June.
The aim of the safe haven was never to solve all the problems - even all the serious problems that people face every day.
Reluctant rescue operations in Palus, where the deaths have been doubled in the fight against finding survivors
For the rest of our lives, the situation was even more dangerous.
“The situation is very difficult,” said 35-year-old Rosa Kusuma, whose mother comforted her daughter - in-law at the Palu city evacuation centre.
“In every minute, new people will be reached with the ambulance.
Clean water isn't enough."
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed homes, sorting things out and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were infected and diseases that had damaged 7,5-magnetic soil color were inexhaustible.
Some injured individuals, including injured limbs and an oil spill in the hand of Dwi Haris, rested outside the Palu military ward where patients were treated under urgent conditions because of persistent persistent follow-up.
Her eyes were filled with tears when she remembered how a strong earthquake took her fifth round hotel room, which she shared with her husband and daughter.
"It's time to save yourself.
I think I've been killed in the walls against the wall," Haris Associated Press said, adding that his family had come from the dust.
"I heard my wife crying, but then it worked.
I don't know what happened to him and my kid.
I hope they're not safe."
U.S. High Commissioner accused China of "suspending on advertising"
A week after the official newspaper of China published four newspaper advertisements under the U.S. daily for the mutual benefit of US-China trade, U.S. President Pekingit accused the use of the US press of propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to an addendum paid by China Daily on the third day in the register of De Moines - the most tragic newspaper in Iowa - after China was accused of taking part in the United States Congress on 6 November, which China refuses.
The trumpet accused Beijing of trying to interfere with the US elections, noted what U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new stage in the Washington-wide campaign to expose China's stress.
While it is common for foreign governments to make advertising promotions, Beijing and Washington are currently in the growing trade war, where one import tariff is adjusted.
In the beginning of the Chinese tariff war, the anti-dumping measures were designed to kill such countries as Iowa exporters, as they supported the parties of the Republical Republic of Trump, China and the US experts have explained.
U.S. President of China and former Iowa Governor, as well as China's largest exporter of agricultural products Terry Branstad, said Beijing was damaging American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in the Des Moines Register on Sunday: "The Chinese have now doubled their temptation by publishing a hard work commercial in our free journalism."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American government’s expensive freedom of expression and the habit of free journalism, Des Moines added its level of advertising to the Register,” Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, there is only a limited voice in Beijing today and does not really see the different opinions that the people of China may be concerned about the economic direction of China, considering that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he added.
He added that one of China's most striking stories refused to publish his article.
Analysts warn that the Republicans will recruit female voters before the mid-elections with Kavanaugh
While many republics are waiting and protecting Supreme candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been charged with several sexual assaults, analysts have warned that they will see an early retirement during the interim elections, especially for women.
The circumstances surrounding the situation have been low and most of the republics have already shown that they want to proceed with the vote.
These things can't be taken back," said Professor Grant Reeher of the University of Syracuse, Maxwell, professor of political sciences at the school.
Reeher expressed doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last minute's effort with regard to the FBI's investigation is sufficient to calm angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday – they don’t forget it either tomorrow or November,” said a number of progressive group of parents and national representative Karine Jean-Pierre Washington DC.
On Friday morning, the memorialist "November is coming!" in his Senate corrigendum, because the Republicans who control the judicial committees decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Fordi's confession, told Mic.
"Democratic input and internalization is about to disappear from the graph," said unofficial political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the press.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But this may be higher, especially in women's voters and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who do not like the President and are often left without a vote."
Even before Fordi’s public testimony, which described his allegations of sexual assault against the candidate for the Court of Justice, the analysts predicted the withdrawal if the ruling classes continued.
"It has become very confusing for GOP," said former President Michael Steele NBC News.
"This is not only about the Commission's vote, its final vote or whether Kavanaugh is put into office, it also concerns how the republics have dealt with it and how they have dealt with it," Head of Priorities USA (a group that helps to select Democrats), head of the press channel Guy Cecil.
However, it seems that the Americans are a little divided by those who believe in Fordi and who Kavanaugh after the evidence, but there is a little more support for the first.
YouGoo’s new question showed that 41% of the respondents were either sure or likely for Ford’s testimony, whereas 35% said they were either sure or likely to believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh had probably lied during his testimony, while only 30% thought about Fordi.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other charge of Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford recognized the Senate's trial committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the candidate for the State Court showed him his relatives when they participated in the 1980s during the study in Yale.
The World Wide Web browser is planning to launch a new Internet that will take a look at Google and Facebook
World Wide Web browser Tim Berners-Lee launched an idu company that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest Inrupt project of the Technology Legend is a company that builds out the Berners-Lee open source code platform Solid.
Solids allow users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to information.
In a special debate with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s objective was to “control the world”.
"We have to do it now," he said about the former company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their "private online data collection" or POD.
It may include contact points, task list, calendar, music collection and other personal and competent tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which is all available in one browser and at the same time.
This personal online data collection only makes it possible for the user to choose who can access this information.
The company refers to it as "by data for the granting of personal authorisations".
According to company leader John Bruce, Inrupt is the idea that the company will produce sources, processes and appropriate skills to help all of Solid to make available.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM's purchased security platform, some of the developers who have been hired to work on the project under the contract, and a community of free coders.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using Inrupt website tools.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google, whether to bring about a complete change if all of their business models are fully supported.
"We don't ask for their permission."
On Saturday, in a post published in Media, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt aims to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he was in Massachusetts at the World Wide Web Consortium.
Over the last few months, Berners-Lee has been talking about the network's privacy in a voice.
At the start of the Inrupt even Berners-Lee World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute will become the founder and director.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next period of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The opening of the Memorial of Christ’s Spirit in the First World War
Only during the first world war did the church of England celebrate its 100th anniversary.
Colonel Bernard Vann won his title on September 29, 1918 in the Bellenglish and Lehacourt attacks.
But four days later, he disappeared from the gunman's ear. He didn't know he had won the highest British military record.
He and his two sons opened the memorial record on Saturday at Rushdenis Northamptonshire.
One of his sons, Michael Vann, said it would be “geneally symbolic” if the stone would open exactly 100 years after the old man's prized struggle.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his patrol over Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "too much of a lot of noise in the ears of the deaf and the deaf."
Later, he rushed into the attack zone and carried it forward with “the greatest disaster” before he went alone to one of the trainers and three against him.
Colonel Vanni killed a German sniper on October 4, 1918, when the war ended a few months later.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather's work was "something I know I can never repeat, but for which I am always grateful."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set up after a parade led by the king of Brentwood.
Michael Vann said he had a "very great opportunity to share in this paradise" and added that "so many people's location and support show that real interest is being paid."
The MMA fans were Bellator 206 to watch all night over, but you only saw Peppat
Imagine that you've been through the night to see Bellator 206, but you can't see this basic event.
San Jose Mass contained 13 fights, including six key cards, and this was shown on channel 5 of the United Kingdom in direct traffic all night.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Moses and Rory MacDonald were preparing to cross the border with each other, the United Kingdom's spectators left their mouths ammo because the screen appeared in Pärsas Peppa.
Many have not been inspired by this, especially those who have remained awake to their old age to see just this struggle.
One enemy described the transition in Twitter to children’s comics as “a bit of a joke”.
"This is the government regulation that at 6 p.m. the content was no longer appropriate and they had to object to the children's programme," explained Dave Schwartz, former vice-president of Bellatori on marketing and communication issues when asked about transport.
"The Peppa," yes.
Bellator President Scott Cooker said that they are planning to work on their timetable in order to take more account of the United Kingdom observers in the future.
"When I think about the restoration now, I think we can solve this problem in the future," said Cooker.
"Even if there are about 6 Sundays in the morning, we can't do this before our birthday, which is their first day.
But we're working on it.
Trust me when the program was modified, there was a lot of background text and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical disorder.
But it wasn't. It was government rule.
I can let you know that next time it doesn't happen.
We're showing six instead of fighting -- as we usually do -- we're trying to offer the fans more and we're just going over time.
It's a tabbar situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley knew himself about sex as “low value”
Tom Daley, who was involved with Olympics, says that he grew up believing that he was more valuable to others because of his sexuality - but it gave him motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old boy said he didn't understand until he went to high school that "no one's like him."
Sharing Lauren Laverne's Radio 4 sent desert Island Discs, she said she was talking about homo rights to give hope to others.
Even becoming a child changed his attitude toward winning Olympic games, making him feel that it is no longer so important.
You can get the usual long-term ambassador Kirsty Young had to take a few months off because of his illness.
On Laverne's first visit, Daley said he felt less valuable than others because it was not socially acceptable if you liked boys and girls.
He said: “Even to this day these feelings are that I am not worthy and that I am not worthy of being different, gave me power and power to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was "nothing" worth, and he didn't let others cheat when they finally got to know him about sex.
The two-fold pronks Olympic winner has become highly rated LGBT champion by using his appearance to the National Community Games in Australia this year in order to turn to stronger countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he was talking about it because he was convinced that he could live openly without any consequences and also want to give others hope.
Three times the world's mayor said that love for a man - American film artist Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "was a surprise."
Daley married 20 years ago with his old Oscar winner, but he said that age was never a problem.
"If you're so young," he went to his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died about three years later -- it was difficult to find someone who had experienced similar rise and fall.
A couple were born in June, and they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "all appearance" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything would have been related to winning the gold medal," he said.
“You know, there are a lot more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011, after an adult diagnosis.
Daley said his father didn't agree to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets in London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in a private room.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Father, you can’t sit in prison, because for this time you are no longer’,” he said.
"I held her hand when she stopped breathing, and only after she really stopped breathing and died I finally confessed that she was not victorious," she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a prox.
“I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life – going home with the people in front of the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling than that,” he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Heather Small's Proud - which helped him prepare Olympics and still makes him a canal.
Desert Island Discs is BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST on Sunday.
Mickelson was removed from Ryder Cup's game on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson makes a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th day Ryder Cup game, but he needs to improve his form to avoid a successful write-off.
Mickelson, who plays 12 times a record event every two years, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for a Saturday match and a four-year-old.
Instead of being in the middle of the activity, as he has often been for the United States, the winner divided his day into two days, being an uplifter and working on his game, hoping to improve it.
Never the most direct shooter, not even at his career tops, is not suitable for 48-year-olds to play especially on the hot Le Golf National golf course, where the long karma race continues to punish the wrong shots.
And if it's not scary enough out there, there's Michaelson on Sunday, his nine-year-old British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who's joined forces with powerful starter Tommy Fleetwood to win all his four competitions this week.
If the Americans, who are 12 at the beginning of the 12th single game with four points, start fire, it may be very important for Mickelson's competition.
Furyk expressed his trust in her husband, but he did not have much to add.
"He fully understood his part today, pushed me to the floor, put his hand around my arm and said he was ready tomorrow," added Furyk.
“He’s very confident.
He's been listening and he's given our teams so much last week and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I saw you get stronger, but it went like this, and we had to choose a course like that.
He wants to be out like everybody else."
Mickelson spends Nick Faldo's record on Sunday only as a player in Ryder Cup games.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never responded to his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 winnings, 20 losings and seven weeks, but Furyk said his place has given his team an additional spiritual contribution.
"He's funny, looky, excited, he likes to have fun with people and he's just great in the team room," he explained.
“I think that this week the young players were going against him for fun and it was great to see.
He offers more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that big progress can soon be lost
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his own experience that the great leadership position at the beginning of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily become an unpleasant experience.
Denmark's public presence in Valderama's 1997 competition, where with Captain Seve Ballesterose was held in front of the American five-point elite, but over the finish season it was dramatically reduced, only with a result of 1411⁄2 : 1311⁄2.
“You remember even that we had a great leadership position in Valderama; we also had great success in Brooklyn, where we lost and Valderama where we won, it became a great win,” said Bjorn, who was in the picture after Class of 2018, 5 :3 on the lines and 10 :6 Le Golf Nationalis.
So history shows me and the entire team that it can repeat.
You're going to give your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right thing.
It's not over before you have points in your book.
We have the goal of fighting cancer and therefore we are focusing on it.
I've been saying all the time, I've been focusing on 12 players who are on our side, but we're very aware of who's our opponents -- the world's best players."
Satisfied with how his players have played in this difficult golf field, Bjorn added: “I’m not going to rush things.
It's a whole new obstacle tomorrow.
Tomorrow they're reading personal stories and so it's more than anything else.
It's good to be with the opponent when things go well, but if you're there personally, you're being tested to the full extent as a golfman.
It's a message you have to send to players - give yourself the best tomorrow.
Now, if you leave your partner, he must go and get himself."
Unlike Bjornis, Jim Furyk expects his players to act personally better than with opponents, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received from four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both during these last days, being part of the Brooklyn team that won the victory before being part of the defeat when Europe fought the "Michael of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw urged his players to put all their game on the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you have to start with fire, like Brooklyn and like Medina.
If the mountain goes one direction, it will cause great stress to the central competitions.
We set up our team according to our team and put the boys out in the way we know that this can happen tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to run the competition and he is the best in line with Rory McIllroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmi, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as well as the best Europeans in other competitions.
"I put my sons in such order, because I think we are properly covered," Bjorn said of his choice of solo games.
Germany's new warship resurfaced
Germany’s newest railways should have been used in 2014, replacing the age of the cold war times, but this did not happen years ago, due to the damage to the damaged systems and the costs of the Lumepallin, local media reported.
The use of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class speedboat "Rheinland-Pfalzi" is currently underway for the first half of 2019 according to the military press published in the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship would have been expected to join the sea in 2014, but the subsequent problems of transfer did not make this ambitious project easy.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships, which were commissioned by the sea in 2007, replace the old Bremen class speedboats.
It is understandable that they have the power of noise, including anti-aircraft and ships, and some mysterious technologies, such as reducing radar, infrared and listening signals.
Other important options include longer periods of care - the most recent fast - paced travel should be possible from home for up to two years.
However, the continued delays mean that at the peak of the war zones - which allow Germany to strengthen foreign power - are already becoming an adult during the service period.
The F125 failure occurred in the news last year when Germany officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the port of Hamburg Bloom & Voss.
This was the first time the ship had been sent back to the shipbuilder after it was obtained.
There was little knowledge about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited several important "software and hardware deficiencies", which turned into an obstacle to military use if they were used on the fighting mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg class ship manages about 120 crews of seamen - only half of the working force of the Bremen class.
It also made it clear that the ship is significantly superior, which reduces its force and limits its ability to add future developments.
7000 tonnes of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ are likely two times more difficult than the same class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the damage to the waste, the whole project's cost, including training, is also a problem.
It has been said that this amounts to EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared with the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the new rapids become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that undermine Germany's maritime power.
At the beginning of the year, President Hans-Peter Bartels of the German Parliament's Defence Commission acknowledged that the sea has actually "outboarded out of ships".
The officer said that this topic has grown in time because the old ships were removed, but the replacement ship did not come.
He expressed his regret that no one from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could connect to the sea.
National Trust Examines the Secret of Health
The purpose of a new study carried out in the country of the forest is to reveal how the skinbirds use land to search for their food.
It is expected that the results will give new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will help guide future protection measures.
A study by the National Trust scientists in Scotland, based on Inverwe's age, is followed by the traditional and sopranipipel, as well as by the deep roots and Daubenton leather.
Special registries shall be placed in the main locations of the area in order to monitor the activities of the whole area.
NHS staff and volunteers shall also carry out interlocutory investigations using handles.
The competent assessment of all stocks shall determine the frequency and type of activity of leprosy outbreaks.
Then there will be a map of the habitats and your report to create a detailed map of their behaviour.
NTS naturalist Rob Dewar hopes that the results will show which habitats are the most important for leprosy and how different species use them.
This information will help to determine the usefulness of the management of habitats, such as the creation of habitats and how best to maintain forests for wildlife and other species associated with them.
In Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, the number of cases of leprosy has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect their place of residence and their loss.
Air turbines and lighting can also pose a threat to themselves, as well as the chemical treatment of certain construction materials, as well as attacks on petals.
The skin rash isn't really dark.
But because of their nightly hunting, they are more useful than their eyes when trying to reach their destination.
They use complex land-based techniques to identify the bottlenecks and obstacles on their flight plan.
Over 270 historical buildings, 38 important lakes and 76,000 hectares of land are seriously affected by NTSs.
They have ten trained experts who conduct regular research, review and sometimes save.
The organisation has even created the first and only special reserve in the territory of Thrave in Dumfrie and Galloway, where there are eight of the ten skin species of Scotland.
Chief Minister David Thompson says this area is an ideal territory for them.
"Threave has a large area for sheepskins," he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a great place to live.
But there is much more to discover about the sheepfolds, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need."
It stresses the importance of controlling skin rashes prior to the start of care activities in the closet, since the destruction of one pregnancy and birth site may kill up to 400 mothers and young people, and even destroy the entire local population.
Dogs have been protected and their killing, arresting or destruction is illegal.
Mr. Shot, Chief of the Health Protection Union, Elisabeth Ferrell has urged the public to help.
He said: "We still have so much to learn about our sheep, and we just don't know how many of our species and how their populations feed."
Ronaldo makes violent accusations back while the lawyers are planning to appeal to the German newspaper
Christian Ronaldo has rejected the allegations of violence against him as “a fraud, ” saying that people “make themselves advert” using his name.
Her lawyers are planning to file charges published by German journalist Der Spiegel.
The attackers of Portugal and Juvenice have been accused of violence against the American community of Kathryn Mayor at the Las Vegas Hotel in 2009.
He claimed to have paid 330 643,10 euros for the woman's salary so that the difference would not be talked about, reported Der Spiegel on the lines.
Turned directly to the 142 million of his followers after hearing the charges, Ronaldo (33) was reported to be "inflicted".
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today's talk is false," said the winner of the Ballon d'Or five times.
They want to advertise for my name.
It's normal.
They want my name to be heard, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player laughing.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a complaint before the Der Spiegel trial regarding "the fact that there is no doubt about the lack of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player seeks a reward "for causing moral damage which corresponds to the difficulty of breaking, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years."
In June 2009, the case was found in the village of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After the meeting at the club, Ronaldo and Mayor reportedly returned to the hotel room where he claimed, according to the local court of Clarke, they were raped on the basis of the documents submitted by Nevada.
In Mayor, he claims that Ronaldo was born after the alleged incident and told him that he is "99% good man", of whom "one percent will die".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed a couple of sexual relations, but that wasn't the same.
Mayor also claims that he went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but he later agreed with an extrajudicial solution because he was afraid "after payment" and was concerned about "on public ground".
Now the 34-year-old woman says she's trying to reverse the solution now because the alleged case continues to traumatize her.
Ronaldo was supposed to have left Manchester United during the attack and joined Real Madrid and this summer he won 100 million euros of the Great Juve in respect of Italy.
Brexit: The UN can start to regret the departure of car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom "to regret it forever" if it lost its position as leader of the world's car industry after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that Toyota's UN had told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop in the production industry located near Derby in Burnaston.
"Let's break the deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of cross-border position without Brexit's agreement could be paid at work.
Burnastone made up of Toyota Auris and Avenis vehicles, produced about 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that when Britain starts leaving the EU at the end of March, we see the end of its production process in progress," said Director Marvin Cooke, Acting Director of Burnaston Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers have also feared leaving the EU without agreement, feeling concern about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it closes the Mini factory in Oxford after Brexit for one month.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the supply chain risks in the absence of Brexit agreement.
The Toyota production line shall work as necessary where the spare parts arrive from both the United Kingdom and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without the agreement concluded on 29 March, there may be problems which, according to the industry, may cause delays and lack of components.
Toyota would not be able to keep its Derbyshire factory more than one day's stock, so production must be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May Checkers' plan with regard to future EU relations is "really calibrated to avoid such controls at the border."
"We agree. We want the best solution that will enable us to do what we want, and not just use the current success, but take away all the opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4 shipments Today.
"The evidence not only of Toyota but also of other producers shows that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain complex."
Toyota could not say how long the production was stopped, but in a longer perspective he warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the industry and eventually pay for work.
Peter Tsouvallar, a representative of the United Nations Agency for 24 years in Burnaston, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “We know from our experience that when jobs fail, they don’t come back.
The president of the government said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan on our future relations with the EU."
The trumpet meeting with Rosenstein can be resumed, says the White House
Donald Trump's meeting with the great contributions of Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can continue another week, as the struggle continues against the highest-level candidate Brett Kavanaugh, stated on the White House's Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Specialist Robert Mueller, who is investigating the intervention of Russia's elections, the relationship between the help of the Trump and Russia and the possible ban on the rule of law by the President.
Whether Trump is a major prosecutor's agent and thereby threatens Mueller's identity, Washington has been incinerated for several months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed with Trump the use of surveillance devices and the possibility of removing the President through Amendment 25.
Rosenstein didn't confirm it.
But earlier on the first day, he went to the White House and announced he was going to sit back.
Instead, it was reported on the fourth day of the meeting with Trump, which was then at the time in New York to the UN.
Trump said he didn't want to leave Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid contact with the Senate's hearing of the judge, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, gave both confessions.
In the course of the proceedings, Trump informed the FBI of the charges against Kavanaugh against one-week investigation by the Senate in favour of a vote.
The trumpeter's president Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday on the news channel Fox News.
When she was asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It may be this week, but it can be another week, taking into account all that is going on with regard to the summit.
But let's look at it and keep it in the press, as always."
Some journalists would argue that Sanders has not been holding the White House press conference since 10 September.
Agent Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the information hours button did not allow TV reporters to be maliciously accused of fraud, although he added: "I do not object to the fact that they have been deceived."
Then he recommended direct contact between Trump and the press.
The President will do more questions and answers than any president before him," he said, without adding evidence: "We have looked at these numbers."
Info hours continue, Sanders confirmed, but “if the press has an opportunity to ask questions directly from the United States President, it is much better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do it a lot and you've seen how we've done it in the last few weeks, so it happens during the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions from the White House when leaving or participating in open meetings or press conferences with visitors.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated perhaps why, having gathered before the press for free time and sometimes with a strange appearance .
The Ministry of Health wrote to EU workers NHS Scotland about Brexit’s fears
The Ministry of Health has written to EU workers working in Scotland NHS to express their gratitude and wish to apply them according to Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent his letter when I was released from the United Kingdom from the EU for less than six months.
The Government of Sweden has already committed itself to cover the costs incurred by EU citizens working in its public-law services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “Suve has continued negotiations on the return of the United Kingdom to the EU, focusing on its expected decisions.
However, the Government of the United Kingdom has also made preparations for possible non-agreement scenarios.
I know it's a very disturbing time for you.
So I wanted to repeat now how much I value each employee's contribution regardless of his nation.
Officials from all over the EU and others will bring valuable experience and skills that will strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit our patients and communities.
Shotima is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie passed after a head trauma
Tennessee State Tigers Supporter Christion Abercrombie passed after a special section of the day's main assault and arrest at 31 : 27 Vanderbilt Commodores, published by Tennessee Mike Organ.
Tennessee State's chief coach Rod Reed told reporters that the accident occurred just before the end of the year.
"He fell apart and just broke up together," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie a glass of oxygen before he was assigned to the canderam for further review.
Tennessee State official Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) said Abercrombie operation Vanderbilt Medical Centeris has been completed.
Harris added that there is no details about the type/debt type of infection yet and Tennessee State is trying to explain where the infection occurred.
Abercrombie's second year's knowledge of the Red Cross was in its first season in Tennessee State after an Illinoian overcrowding.
He had five fights on Saturday before leaving the game, which took up to 18 races this summer.
Foreigners must pay higher temple fees in the UK
Foreigners have to pay higher temple fees if they buy stock in the United Kingdom using this extra money to assist households under the new Tory plans
This step is damaging to the young voters of Corby's attempt to win
Temple tax shall be paid to those who do not pay in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects it to create up to 120 million laughs per year to help households
Foreigners have to pay a higher amount of temple tax if they buy a fixed asset in the United Kingdom using it to help households, Theresa May said today.
The movement is to be tried to bring harm to Jeremy Corby's attempt to entice young voters with the permission to offer them a decent life and to target people with high income.
The temple tax shall be paid by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom with a view to combating the desire of the additional government to combat housing.
The addition - which is in addition to this temple tax, including higher levels established two years ago for the second house and for the purchases related to the future - may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects this movement to create up to 120 million laughs a year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's purchased non-United Kingdom residents are entitled to increase prices and make it difficult for first-time buyers to get under foot while fighting for their lives.
Many powerful regions of the country, especially in the capital, have become "citizens" thanks to a large number of foreign buyers who carry most of their time out of the country.
A new policy will only be possible within a few weeks of Boris Johnson's invitation to lower the temple tax to help young people fight their first home.
He accused large construction companies of high maintenance of fixed-rate prices when they bought countries but did not use them, and invited Mayd to exempt the quota of affordable homes to improve Britain's 'life-related shame'.
Corbyn has been informed of the reform of the viable housing economy, including rent control and the end of the kidnapping of working people.
He also wants to give the authorities greater powers to build new houses.
May said: “I promised last year that I would dedicate my life to the restoration of the dream of the British prime minister that every new generation would be better.
And that means improving our broken housing system.
Britain is always open to people who want to live, work and build their own life here.
At the same time, it is true that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as businesses who live abroad, are as easy to buy homes as those who work hard in the UK.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away, and harsh conditions of sleep are normal reality."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderlan's leader, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to get a leader in Scotland at some point.
Shotlane (42) welcomes the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, which is currently in the third place in League One, with only 3 points behind it.
He flew that summer to the stadium Stadium of Light after he had brought St. Mirren back to the House of Masters.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got a B-class and this thing off," Ross BBC told Scotland to get a Sportsound.
"As I grew up with my father in Hampden and it's always something that's got me back.
But this opportunity will only come when I am successful in leading the club."
Rossi's predecessors in Sunderland have been Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he did not feel such great and famous fear in front of such names, having previously held back both in Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"It is now a success for me to be able to bring this club to the Masters' League."
Because of its structure and buildings it belongs to the Masters' League without a doubt," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I can see myself as successful only if I can get the club back there."
Ross has only worked as a leader for three years, with former Deputy Director of Dumbarton and a 15-month-old Heartsman.
Then he helped Allo to regain his third degree and transformed St. Mirren's lowest position into the next master's winner.
And Ross says he feels comfortable now when he was in his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirrenis and Hamilton Academy.
"To do was with true Christians," he recalled taking Allo.
“I really believe that management is more appropriate for me than playing.
It seems weird, because I got started, I got a reasonable income, and I enjoyed some tips.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things to do every week.
I still experience this pain and stress in my work, but the management just seems right.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I'm doing it. I feel more comfortable now than I used to be in my old age."

According to the study, the best time for the surface is on Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
The capacity has improved British emergency pubs, but more stress has resulted in restaurant tickets.
The figures showed that pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
These figures were prepared by CGA representative Peter Martin: “The continued increase in the expectations of the sun and of England meant that Christmas was similar to that of June when the pubs were growing by 2.8 percent, except that it was even more difficult for restaurants.
In June, trade in restaurants decreased by 1.8% in poor July.
Drive-based pubs and bars were the most successful businesses and the most efficient restaurants are to enjoy.
Food-based pubs also suffered from the sun, although not both dramatic and restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to get out.
The volume of food sold between managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, while the sales of food decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, an analysis of free time travel and hospitality, said: “These results continue to be the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The effects of climate and major social or sports events will be greater if the sale is outside the domestic market.
It is not surprising that restaurant tickets continue to fight, although sales decrease by 4.8% compared to last year is particularly high in addition to the current price prices.
Long and hot juice would not have been able to come at a better time and only time shows whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August provide some emergency relief."
The increase in the total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown of the trade mark-related authorities.

One child has five secret social media accounts that they hide for their parents
The study concluded that one child of five, part of them 11 years of age, is a secret social media account they hide for their parents and teachers
A study of 20 000 grams showed a rise in “false Insta” leaves
The news raised the fear of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had the "primary account" they wanted to show to their parents.
The study concluded that one child of five, part of them only 11 years of age, creates a secret social media account that they hide for adults.
In the 20 000 summaries reported in the study, there was a marked increase in the “false Insta” account (for the five image-sharing page).
The news raised the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said that they were both meant to show their parents as well as to receive a "primary account".
One of her 13 - year - old daughter's secret paper found out that she had been invited to rape others.
The Digital Avareness UK and the private organization Headmasters" and Headmystresses" Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of the 11-18 years of age owned two profiles and half of them acknowledged the existence of personal accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: "It's a shock to see so many other people get rid of animal accounts online where parents and teachers don't find them."
Second Doyle will be a Scottish Athletics sports team leader
Yesterday, Doyle was elected the Executive Director at the annual meeting of the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Doyle has the greatest appreciation for Scotland's short-term strength, and Ian Beattie, President, described it as an opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his extensive international experience in the last decade.
"Eilids are respected in all communities in Scotland, the United Nations and other sports communities and we are convinced that the Shoto sportsmen are benefiting from its leadership," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be a sports speaker and I hope that I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland and help this development."

Side pump advertising, similar to women's smiles, shares the Internet with two
The coastal pump company has shared the Internet with two readers advertising that compares amazing smiles of her mother.
According to the case, in order to mark the “world’s first hard-to-fashioned flag bomb” presentation, Elvie, a technology company directed to consumers, published a similar commercial similar to the ironic music video, in order to present the freedom that this new bomb gives to mothers who want to live.
The four real moms dance with their hands full of smiles and sing: "Yes, I love myself, but you don't see me Saturday" and "If you didn't notice, they're not weird, they're my walls."
The song repeats: "The pump, the pump, I feed the child, the pump, the pump, I milk my ladies."
However, the advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has produced similar opinions online.
The video viewers with 77,000 times viewed and thousands of comments are in a different opinion. Many of them say it highlights the logic of the dairy industry.
‘The use of leaves for advertising this product was a very difficult decision.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and born to produce milk, but the difference is that children are stolen from them in the days after birth," wrote one.
Elvie breast pump does not dry the eyes of the nursing nurse (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: “A mother and a child can be traumatized.
But why not use these children only to advertise the mother's breast pump?"
Someone's added: A totally unfashioned commercial."
One woman thought the story was over.
"I think doing is a genius idea.
I'd buy myself something if I was still eating with the cheese.
The milk pump made me feel totally bad.
The commercial's a little round, but we're taking things as it is.
It's a genius product," wrote one.
Another commented: “It’s fun for advertising (often at work or at home) to pumping pumps and self - conscious mothers.
This ad doesn't support or understand much of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they've all danced with non-smokered pumps.
The campaign's idea is based on the fact that many breast-feeding women feel bad.
But Elvie Pump is completely active, no leads and no towers and no eyes from the admirer, allowed women to move freely, keep the children and even walk in the air during the bombing.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such a innovative product that it is wrong to arouse and arouse curiosity.
Compared to the opportunities for women to express themselves and the dairy industry, we wanted to raise the breast pump and all its challenges, at the same time presenting them in a pleasant and familiar manner, taking into account the extraordinary amount of freedom that the new pump is creating.
This isn't the first time that the news has reflected Elvie's pump.
In the north of London, the designer Marta Jakubowski presented the product of two children's mother.
The children of God - fearing migrants went to the border of Texas with telecommunications
The number of children of displaced migrants has increased steadily, although all restrictions have remained quite the same. In part, due to the fact that the difficult rhetoric and policy of the authorities of Trump has changed with the help of the sponsors of the establishment of children.
In general, most sponsors are immigrants with documents and they are afraid of violating their country's ability to continue, which requires the child's right to care.
In June, when national powers announced that potential sponsors and other households could submit a cross-label and data are shared with the immigration authorities.
In the past week, immigration and customs officer Matthew Albence admitted to Congress that the agency arrested a real person who had asked for financial support from non-participating sub-nationals.
The Agency later confirmed that there was no criminal past of 70 per cent of the arrested.
"About 80 percent of sponsors or residents of sponsors live illegally in the country, and a large number of them are under criminal control.
So let's keep track of them," Mr. Albence said.
In order to deal more quickly with the children, officials made new rules requiring parts of them to appear within a month of detention.
Many defend their legal content by means of a video conference, here to come.
A person who is not eligible to be released shall be sent out of the country immediately.
On the basis of the reports of the system published in the last months by the staff of the shelter, the longer the child is suffering, the more likely they become nervous or depressed, which may cause violent moods or escape tests.
Lawyers say these concerns are more current in large detention institutions such as Tornillo, where children’s difficulties may remain between two eyes due to size.
They added that children’s arrival in the telephone area without having enough time to exercise or to stay well with friends can lead to trauma that many already face.
Syria requires the departure of the United States, France and Turkey from the occupation forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam invited Syrian refugees to come home at the UN General Assembly, even though the country has been in the war for 20 years.
Mojalem, also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces had illegally planned and acted against terrorist equipment on the Syrian surface.
“They must leave immediately and under conditions,” he said in the assembly.
Moulalem claimed that Syria’s “war against terrorism is almost over.” Since 2011, more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have left their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "to fight in this holy war until we have cleansed all Syria's territory" from terrorist groups as well as "any extraterrestrial force that is illegally present."
The United States of America has about 2000 forces in Syria, mainly training and consulting both Kurdish entities and Syrian Arab opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 forces from war in the country.
Speaking on the subject of refugees, Moulalem said that the conditions for their return are appropriate and he accused the incomprehensible fears that prevent the arrival of refugees in spreading part of the Western world.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to assist in their recovery," he said.
"They're policyging something that's a terrible humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be helped to recover until the end of the war between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which will lead to the last mass support point in the Idlib area, has created an opportunity to continue with political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has preserved three million people living in the province of Russia's long-standing Syrian forces.
But Moulalem stressed that the contract is "expressive times" and expressed the hope that military action would meet the guerrillas, including Al-Qaeda, the Nursra Front soldiers who are "to be destroyed".
The UN's successor, Staffan de Mistura, will soon convince new government and opposition members of the first meetings of the United Nations to plan for the post-Syria military constitution and take steps to choose.
The panel presented requests for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, saying that the work of the panel could be limited to the review of the articles of the present Constitution and warned of interference.
Why is Trump also selected as the second official?
According to this logic, Trump could win the following elections in 2020 if it had not already ended its presidential diameter, as liberal observers would likely wish.
What should undoubtedly be "the most exciting end of the presidency!"
At present, viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, top-hour ratings have doubled by over 1.05 million CNN and nearly 1.6 million by way of MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers. Compared to 1.7 million viewers of four-year-old members, MSNBC has increased their number. Through the "The Rachel Maddow Show" 3.5 million viewers have kept this rating high during the first night news.
"This is the effort we are involved in because we don't understand it," said the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" on the Head of Government Secretary, who will become the President when the storm destroys the House of Parliament.
Nell Scovell, who has experienced comedy writer and book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," author, is another theory.
He recalls the 2016 elections in Boston before.
The leader told him he was voting for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He said he'd give me a laugh," said Mr. Scovell to me.
All this box has a pleasant value.
Of course not as much as any other TV shows, Washington can be sent to the future of Roe v. Wade and reunify the immigrant families and the global economy.
Avoiding the subject is only a precedent for viewers.
However, six-hour expert stories about Bob Woodard's "substantial background research" for his book "Fear" and Paul Manafort 13 225.73€ of the taxable January tax on Bomber (Washington Post said about it "extreme self-defense") and Stormy Daniels' security principles regarding Mr. Trump’s anatomism may be described by the viewer as more than a trained citizen.
For example, I don't look at Super Mariod anymore with the same feeling.
“One of his activities that may seem to be serious is that he shares something every night,” said the company Wheelhouse Entertainment operator and the series “Pandkuns” created by Brent Montgomery Trump with the points of the day-to-day plan for the performance of the performance of the performances and day-to-day events (with NFL, with Kim Jong-un’s appreciation).
You must not leave between two eyes any part or other time you are in the country.

Other movements of money into the most accurate selection of the White House
It is not surprising that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, money supply is being reorganised through the reorganization of the convention area by sending two market-led entrepreneurs to the same place.
Thanks to this authority, it is again the president of the Pittsburgh region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Lamb, who won last morning's special elections in the second region.
Lambi's opponent is the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently represented by the 12th region of Pennsylvania, which is covered by a new 17th.
The cards were amended following the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January, so the old areas were divided into areas of electoral opposition, according to the Federal Republic of Germany.
New 17 elections have been launched by the campaign, which is bringing money to the financial sectors of the major departments - the Congress Committee of the Democrats (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republical Campaign (NCRC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after the hit in March at the special elections in the 18th Congress district of Pennsylvania.
This has been the case for several decades, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the region.
Politicians have given the democracies a small advantage.
USA El Salvador was punished for supporting China and then returned
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Peking, a small return to Washington.
Mr. Trump met in June 2017 in a friendly air in Panama with President Juan Carlos Varere and his partners until the Panama Hotel was dismissed by the company's management team.
The Foreign Ministry officials decided to call back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama the leaders of a diplomatic mission from the US, as Prime Minister Heather Nauert said earlier this month that they were no longer supported by Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including for the monitoring, development and economic impact of drugs.
The recommended penalties, which included financial aid reduction and visa restrictions, would have been harmful to the Central American country and its high employment and the number of killings.
During the internal meetings, officials from North America and Central America continued to make a high-level commitment aimed at ensuring security and economic security in order to keep up with the similar meeting that took place last year, which was seen in developing efforts to prevent the movement of environments into the United States.
But in mid-September, high officials explained that they wanted to continue the investigation and to conclude any discussion about El Salvador’s punishments.
In the words of diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pence, speaking in the middle of October, will now be counted to discuss the positions of the government.
And three Americans returned their secretes to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new reports or punishments from Washington.
The President of the White House, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss national debates on the need to remain anonymous.
Their discussions confirmed the government’s close analysis of the need for an anonymous stay.
Study Edition
Next, it may be that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller publishes a report on the possible jurisdiction of Trump on which there are many cases in the state archives.
Mueller is also allegedly investigating whether the Trump campaign is related to Russia's attack on our elections.
If Congress should change from party to party, Trump should be given an understanding in this institution as if he were going to speak again to voters and perhaps even to his fellow judges.
There are a lot of concerns here and I do not want to point out that although Trumpy's backing of his European officials is inevitable.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that affects the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officials were preparing for Hitler’s coups if only Freedom had prevented him and supported the Czechoslovak in Münichi.
We woke up and had no opportunity to avoid the following years' killings.
History moves around such turning points and the love of democracy is getting closer or moving forward.
The Americans are now faced with a number of turning points.
What do we do when Trump, vice-president of the prosecutor, Rod Rosenstein, is the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in heavy water since it was reported that he had made a proposal to keep the president's secret last year and speculated about the inadmissibility of that office.
Rosenstein says The Times' statement is incorrect.
‘How to respond if the recent investigation of the newly requested FBI by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if it is confirmed by reliable allegations of sexual assault and false testimony by the State Court, despite the State Court’s view?
And in particular, do we vote by the Congress on the averages when Trump should be responsible?
If these tests fail, democracy will go to a long winter vacation.
But I believe we're not going to succeed because we've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was kidnapped by Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever taken over and used our headquarters.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later I was sent on a table with the light of the Sabbath.

Rangers' Graham Dorrrans is optimistic before the war of Rapid Vienna
Rangers organises Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that you will win Australia, which followed this month's memorable victory against Villarreal in Spain this month, will put them in a strong position to reach the Group of the European Union G.
The birth control did not allow middleman Graham Dorrrans to first appear before 2:2 a week against the game against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a jumper to get better results.
"That was a good point for us because Villarreal is a strong opponent," said a 31-year-old player.
“We went to the game, believing that we could achieve something and left the game with the point.
We may have been able to achieve more, but in general it was a fair result.
They were better at the first half of the game and at the second half of our second half.
There will be another big and important European night tomorrow.
Hopefully we get three points, but it can be a hard game because they got a good outcome in their last game, but since people support us, I'm sure we can get together and get a good outcome.
The last year was hard, thanks to this, I was injured and the club changed, but now we all have a good sense of humor.
Teams are good and boys really enjoy it; training is good.
Hopefully we can move on now, leave the past behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep due to fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that the participants in the discussion had a clear view of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide study said they were talking to their spouses about long-term maintenance costs.
Only 10 percent said she'd talked to her children about it.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't talk about it at the same time," explained Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Wide Life Insurance.
But it should be started.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare for your family if they don’t know what you want before.
Work with your consultant and family, discussing where and how to get care, because these choices may be extremely important in connection with expenditure.
Keep advice with your financial adviser: Your consultant may have a good plan to pay for their expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care can include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance policy, hybrid financial security policy to help cover these costs, or early self-insurance - as long as you have the necessary funds.
Prepare your legal documents: Forget all possible legal conflicts already.
Take care of yourself in the form of a health service document to identify a trusted person who will follow your doctor’s help and ensure that experts will follow your wishes if you cannot contact yourself.
Also consider the person who is trusted with regard to your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person who would make financial decisions for you and ensure that your money is paid even if you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your mother has a medical emergency and she is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write these things up so you can be ready for it.
"Doing is not only a financial aspect, but it is also important for those who are doctors?" explained Martin.
“What medicines are needed?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Put it all down."

Land colours and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have fallen into a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the walls of Palu city of Indonesia, reporting officials, adding that the number of deaths continues to increase.
Since the link has been broken, the rescuers have not been able to get any information from the Doghera Regensil, located on the north side of the Palu, which remains close to the 7.5-magnetic earth color epicenter.
The request was evacuated after a disaster of more than 16,000 people.
Following are some important facts about Palu and Doghara on the island of Sulawes:
The town is the capital of the Province of Central Sulawes, located on the western coast of the island of Sulawes, where the population was estimated at 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrated on its 40th anniversary when it suddenly fell apart from the earth and tsunami.
The Doha Regent is a region that extends over 300 km (180 miles) from the island of Sulawes.
In 2017, the Regency, which is the administrative area located at the base of the province, was estimated at 299,200 inhabitants.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic activities in the Province of Central Sulawes, in particular in the coastal area of Doghara.
In the province it is also important to acquire a nikki, which has mainly been collected to the Morowal, Sulawesi’s opponent.
In the data of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, the tsunamis have killed Palu and Doghía several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, Tsunami killed more than 200 people in Dodhraa and destroyed hundreds of houses.
In 1996, Tsunami died in the western part of Dodhra, killing nine.
Indonesia is firmly situated on the Pacific Ocean in the spring, and it is regularly covered by soil colours.
Next, we will bring some of the greatest colors of soil and tsunami in recent years:
On 26 December 2004, a massive earthquake struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In March and early April, a number of strong agricultural varieties were found in Sumatra.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8-kradish land color lost Indonesia most of its inhabitants on the southern side of Java, creating a tsunami that killed about 700 people.
2009: The area near Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra, has a 7.6-kraadic landscape.
He's lost over 1100 people.
2010: 7.5-kradish land color lost one of the Sumatra Islands - Mentawai Island, landing up to 10 meters high, which destroyed ten visitors and killed about 300 people.
2016: A severe earthquake struck Pidie Jaya Regentsi Acehis, causing destruction and panic, reminding people of the deaths in 2004 and the destruction of Tsunami.
Tsunamis did not occur at the time, but more than 100 people perished in the complexed buildings.
2018: Larger landscapes met Indonesia's tourist base Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly north of the island.
The earth destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily in exile.
Sarah Palini's oldest son was arrested for crimes of domestic violence
Track Palin, former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's oldest son has been detained in connection with the attack.
According to a report published on August State Troopers, Palin (29) was arrested in the Netherlands of Wasil in connection with the intervention and detention of domestic violence in the case of domestic violence.
According to a police report, when a woman tried to inform the police about alleged crimes, Palin took her phone.
The palinite is kept in the Mat-Su budgetary institution and is kept at an unsecured rate of $500, KTUU said.
He appeared on Saturday at a meeting where he announced that he was "no crime in any case", reported the news network
The ball stands with three A-class values, which means that it can be expected for up to a year's imprisonment and a drop of $250,000.
He is also charged with the value of Class B, which is punishable by one-day imprisonment and a fine of $2000.
This is not the first time a criminal charge has been filed to Palin.
In December 2017 he was convicted by his father, Todd Palini.
In connection with the alleged attack, his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police.
The case is currently being discussed by the Alaska Veterinary Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, domestic violence and possession of a weapon, all of which was in existence.
His friend claimed that the man saw him.
The Veterans groups criticized Sarah Palinit in 2016 when she associated her son with PTSD for violent behavior, resulting from her service in Iraq.
Indoneness following Tsunami:
After a series of earthquakes on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia has lost at least 384 people.
The 7.5-cratic earth-coloured tsunami struck and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks are not working and in the near future there is expected to be an increase in the number of failures.
The Earth was killed by Sulawes in the middle of the border between Indonesia and the capital of Jakarta.
The social media publishes videos showing the moment when the earthquake occurs.
During Tsunami, hundreds of people had gathered to the festival at Palu on the coast of town.
NYC requires federal prosecutors for a rare death from a suspected terrorist attack
The New York federal prosecutors are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, which is suspected of being a terrorist attack on New York by eight people. This rare punishment has not been effective since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used Home Depot's rental cars to attack the railways through the land of the West Side in Alam-Manhattan, both on its way in October and on its way.
In accordance with the request for a death penalty in the South New York region, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed eight victims voluntarily and also caused serious physical injuries voluntarily.
In both cases, it is possible to commit a death penalty on the basis of judicial documents.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal authorities filed a 22-point charge against all Saipov, which included eight homicides with the expressive pressure that federal prosecutors generally use in organised criminal proceedings, and the charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The complaint suggested that "slow planning and prevention should be planned," the prosecutors said, describing the Saip's activity as "slower, bold and bold."
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries and injuries to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci family and friends," states the survey.
Five victims were tourists in Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the last death penalty proceedings in the South-South part of New York.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but as a result, he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last reference was made to the death penalty in New York in 1953 in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, where a married couple broke up after the offence was committed for a period of two years for the approval of the Councils during the Second War.
Both Rosenbergs were destroyed by the electric power plant on June 19, 1953.
In the days and months following the attack, the court documents showed that there was no suspicion.
According to the police, he had told the investigators that he had been treated well.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he was being inspired by the attack to take over the ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also wanted an ISIS tape release at his hospital.
In a 22-point case, he has not committed a crime.
David Patton, a Saip's national defence officer, said they were in the process decision "explicitly deceived".
"In our view, the decision to apply for the death penalty prolongs the trauma of all those involved," said Patton.
Previously, Saipov's defence team asked the prosecutors not to apply for a death penalty.
As a member of the Tory Parliament, NIGEL FARGE should be appointed to conduct Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage agreed during today's Tory conference protest "to mobilize the people's army".
The next head of the UKIP said that politicians had to "know the warmth of the euro-sceptics", as one of the members of Parliament theresa May recommended that they conduct negotiations with the EU.
Conservative subcontractor Peter Bone said in March Birmingham that the UK would "be out now" if Mr Farage would be Secretary Brexit.
But Mrs May is faced with the problem of his deep-deterred rowing, which stressed the left side of the conservatives, joining his protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is faced with the task of keeping his Chechers at the border between Brexit supporters, residents and EU attacks.
The Union requested that it continue to work with Brussels in spite of its opposition and to select Eurosceptics and Liberals on Sunday between its package and "kaose".
Bone said when Leave Means Leave met Solihulis that he wanted to "reject the Chechers' plan".
He recommended taking Farage as a partner and giving him responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'In his responsibility we'd be out now,' he said.
A member of the Wellingborough Parliament added: "I stand out for Brexit, but we have to break up with the Chechers plan."
Reflecting on his answer, he said: “We have not fought in the wars of the world to be victorious.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the recommendations that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The view that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is not true."
Tory Brexit’s support was also in March and told the reporters: “I hope only one: Prime Minister, listen to people.
"The Czecher's plan is unpopular in the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our territory and in our activists who actually go through today and choose us at all.
Please continue the Chequer's plan and start listening."
With a message addressed to May, he said: "Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises."
Farage said that the politicians who had gathered should be ‘inspired’ if they plan to reverse the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a question of mutual confidence – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to train Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that "we won't let this happen."
In his letter to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to introduce our political class, which is on the brink of Brexit’s rebirth.
"We mobilize this nation's national army that gave us victory over Brexit, and we don't rest until we have reached a self-contained, sovereign, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, the remains crossed Birmingham before the city's average of two hours.
In the case of activists, "Tourid Brexit against" was published after the group was created during this week's exchange.
The Liberals Lord Adonis looked at conservatives for security issues that were part of their team's implementation at the opening of a conference.
"These are people who say that they can bring IT systems locally and all technology to Canada, and more often, to cross-border trade in Ireland," he added.
‘Doing is a complete farce.
There's no such thing as good Brexit," he added.
Warren is seriously concerned about candidateing as president.
According to USA Elizabeth Warren, he is seriously considering the elections that took place after November to be a president.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday at the West Massachusetts headquarters.
Warren, President Donald Trump, often criticises the following elections in November to the national representative of GOP, Geoff Diehl, who was chairman of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is speculated that in 2020 it can be displayed against Trump.
The Sunday afternoon event in Hollyoke was his 36th meeting with the voters in the camp after the assembly took place at the Trump office.
The deputy asked whether he was planning to candidate as president.
Warren replied that "The women have time to go to Washington and improve our corrupt government, which means you're in the mood too".
Detention of LSU Simsi in shooting
On Saturday at LA Police Baton Rouge reported that the suspect of the murder of the LSU Corps by Wayde Sims has been arrested.
Baton Rouge's police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson at 11 a.m. at the ET news conference.
They released videos of the shooting order, asking for help to identify the man who appeared in the cameras.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and killed at the city of Southern University in the spring.
"Wayde Sims got deaf and died after that," said police officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday, through 247 sports.
Wade stood up to protect his friend and got heard from Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and he recognized the presence, the possession of a gun and the shooting of Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without interference and was taken to East Baton Rouge's police station.
About two-foot young Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, 10 of them initially, on average 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points and took 2.9 board games.
Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the World Heritage site after his military account gave him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
From this point on, it was made clear that Valtteri Bottas qualified in the field day before Lewis Hamilton, that the Mercedes team's organization played a major role in the battle.
Bottas got a good start and left Hamilton almost unaugural when he twice defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Wettel first went to the boxers and left the Hamilton team behind in a tight drive that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxhead later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went after the crash when Ferrari's leader left the front door to pass away after the third time trying to protect this double move.
Max Verstappen started a fight on the back of the wheel and was at the end of the first round for his 21-year-old birthday.
He then led the competition for most of the time, drove the bullets to the edge of the finish and passed from Kim Räikkönen, taking a fourth place.
He finally drove to the 44th round, but he failed to increase the speed of the last eight rounds, which led to the fourth place for the Räikkönen.
Today is a hard day because Valtter has been doing a good job all week and was a real gentleman when I was a kid.
"The team has done a great job to have one of them," Hamilton said.
It was very heavy on the body.
President Donald Trump, when Senator Diane Feinstein gathered on Saturday, insisted that she had not played Christine Blasey Ford, where she was charged with sexual harassment by the so-called Supreme Britt Kavanaugh.
At the meeting in West Virginia, President Ford did not address the statement directly before the Legal Committee of the Senate, but instead commented on what was happening in the Senate at the moment, which shows that people are "baby, opposite and false".
"The only thing that can happen and is now the beautiful thing that has happened during the Senate for a few days is that you see anger and anger, jealousy, hatred and lying people," he said.
“When you look at the posters and the tapes to which it is said: “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you play?
Do you remember his answer to the question “Did you play the document?” – “Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't move."
Wait a minute.
Did we play... no, we didn't play," added the senator.
Ford sent to Feinstein a letter from Kavanaugh about the crimes that occurred early in September, but Fenstein refused to give up his job.
The Hill reported: “I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations or spread his story,” said the Finnish Committee.
"He asked me to keep my confidentiality and I did so in accordance with his prayer."
However, his decision was not appropriate for the president who commented during the Saturday meeting: “You know what it was very soft on the body.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's one of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing the protection of a high-level candidate accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President said that the Democrats used these charges on their own.
"They have decided to take back the funds without choosing them.
You see this jealousy and hatred. They don't care about those who suffer who need to drive over to get power and leadership," said the President of the Media.
Number of students: Dundee Stars 5 : 3 Belfast Giants
Giantsi Patrick Dwyer broke two devastating Dundee.
Dundee Stars won a series of rounds on Saturday when he returned to Belfast Giantsi, who lost Dundele 5: 3.
Giantes lived early in the game with two rivals, Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the family home for a week before Dwyer took Giants again.
Francois Bouchard compared Dundee's situation before Lucas Lundvald Nielsen won their victory.
It was the third loss for Adam Keefe's men on the elite.
The event was the fourth meeting of the party with Giantes winning the three previous game.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 Kendall McFault and David Rutherford's help, when Beauvillier doubled four minutes later.
Sullivan brought home team on the first round at 13:10 back to the game before Matt Marquartt helped Cownie write the weekend money in 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer assured that Ginants would lead before the first break, at the end of the first third of his night's course.
Outside the home players gathered again, and Bouchard put them back at level, dropping a number of overruns at 27:37 a minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundele the first lead position at the end of the second game, guaranteeing the final third win in their contest area.
Giants who have now lost the last five of the four games will meet at the next game at Milton Keyne's home.
The pilot dies to save hundreds of people from earthquakes
One Indonesian airliner was declared proud of the fact that he gave his life to ensure that hundreds of people were airborne.
The island of Reedel Sulawes was killed by a large earthquake caused by tsunami, resulting in death for more than 800 people, many of whom have remained unknown.
The region's strong consequences and many people are under siege in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agungi's colleagues fled from the Sutira Sis Al Jufri airport, he refused to leave.
He stayed with the apostle to ensure that Batik Air was at the same time a secure aircraft no. 6321.
Then he jumped out of the plane, thinking it'd be different.
He died in the hospital later.
Air Navigation Indonesia, President Johannes Sirait, confirmed that his decision could save hundreds of people, reports Australia ABC News.
We set up a helicopter to transport Kalimantan Balikpanis to the second largest hospital in the city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We were really sorry to hear about it." The press release added.
At the same time, authorities are afraid that the number of deaths may increase to thousands. According to the National Disaster Relief Agency, access to the city of Dothria, Sig and Botong was restricted.
The president of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said: "The number of deaths may increase, as many victims are still under shelters and have not survived."
The 6-metre leases were completed in Palu City, where there is a masculinization on the holy day.
Warships and passenger planes offer assistance and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “The fast-pains bring every one of me new victims.
Pure water is rare.
There's a small market for everyone."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesia Red Cross is quick to help the survivors, but we cannot tell what they can find there.
It's already being done with tragedy, but the situation can still get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and said to the national soldier: “Please work night and day to fulfill all the evangelization duties.
Are you ready for it?" said CNN.
At the beginning of this year, the city of Lomboki, Indonesia, died of earthquakes, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesia Airport: Air Niugin Airport claimed one man lost after the crash
Although it had previously been said that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the airport, the airline now operating in Micronesia has claimed that one man has lost.
Air Niugin said in his statement that since Saturday after sunset they have not been able to find one of the men.
The airline said they work with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find a man.
The operator did not immediately respond to the passenger's details, such as questions about his age and nationality.
Local ships helped to save other passengers and crew after a flight to Chuuki Island flight to land.
The officers told me seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The facts of the accident and the precise events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the United States of America said that the plane landed from the airport.
Some of the witnesses thought that the plane was flying over the airport.
American traveler Bill Jaynes said that the plane was going very low on land.
"It's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers were able to hide on the open plane in the water from the emergency exit.
He mentioned that the room staff was panicked and angry and that he got a little headache.
U.S. sailors and seamen who had been working at a nearby port also helped save their lives by using boats that were full of people before the plane needed some 30 meters below water.
The flight safety network data show that 111 people have died over the last two decades from air accidents related to PNG registered airlines, but none of them were related to Air Niugin.
Analytics are made up of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the Prosecutor closed the case against a man who was charged with burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, an analyst of the United States Department of Justice, spent several hours as an expert in the analysis of the findings.
He brought out to the Water Court how he used cell phones to reopen the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movements on the night they died.
Journalist The Clarion Ledger said Rowlett had received a number of cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chamber on the night when they died, which was contrary to the previous claims of the young man.
When the data showed that he had been with Chamber, the young man himself claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, so he went to talk to the police.
Sanford met on Saturday at the courthouse and admitted he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car, Sanford said that Tellis "was wrong because my car was in Nashville".
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before their death.
The phone records showed that they knew each other only for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped them out of his life," said Hale.
The security plan is to do its own destiny on the holy day.
The judge said he thought that your trial would be going to discuss with the Water Court on the last half of the same day.
The High Width: What is known hypnop?
Hiphop trio wants to fight with a negative gender definition, adding positive messages to music.
The High Broad claims that hypnotism has been eliminated since the beginning of its political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to the hippies and make a familiar hippie again popular.
Bands such as The Fugees and Commons have recently regrouped in Britain thanks to bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Next time you're black?
New York Childcarer complains of racist news after a couple of hearings
The nurse in New York complains that she is a "series of black".
The couple don't think they're racist compared to the pressure.
Two children's mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her regret when she learned that their new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work the first day in 2016.
Mr. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband that he said: "Thirty-III, JERJEKORD MUSTANAHALINE."
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
The New York Post claimed that Plasco-Flaxman, who was unaware of his professional understanding of Mrs. Maurice, claimed that their sociological childcare provider, who was an African American, had done a bad job and had been waiting for him in the Philippines.
Miss Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Maurice now complains to the court to receive compensation for the discharge she wants to receive every day in the amount of $350 in the next six months, and the same work she first hired but without contract.
"I want to show it to them, so to do," he said to the newspaper The Post, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
A few have come back to claim that they are racists, saying that it was reasonable to stop working with Maurice because they feared they could no longer trust her after their rape.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t think about.
He's not racial.
"We are not racist," said his wife, Joel Plasco, in The Post.
"But would you let your children take care of the people you have been unfaithful to, even if it was unwanted?
Your answer?
Come on."
Commenting on the comparison with the expression, Plasco said that his wife was born two months later and was “very difficult”.
“Will you go against someone like that?
It's not very nice now," the investment bank added.
Although the case is still under way, the public opinion has quickly come to the conclusion that some of the social media have failed to understand where they are seriously considered because of their conduct and thinking.
The new book shows that Paddington's writers feared that readers would not be associated with the class talking about it.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving a copy of the Bible, wrote: “It’s difficult to put herself in the hands of someone who read it for the first time.
It's very fun to know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He said that his father, being inspired to write a book about a little playbook, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic after his work had ended, and added that the 60th day of the publication of the book was with his father because of his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, which he described as “very important too important in our family” he added that his father was nevertheless proud of his ultimate success.
"He was certainly a weak man and was not a mean man," he said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like feeling when your child gets something: you're proud of them, although it's not exactly your achievement.
I believe he looked at Paddington in such a way.
Although it was with his creation and imagination, he always recognized Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to leave her on the phone.
On the ground, she brought her daughter to Nice's hospital, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked about saving her life.
"They called regularly to say that the girl's condition was very bad and that they don't believe she's alive," said Mr. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nadi, who said my daughter died within two minutes, and I have to leave her well.
And I did.
I said: “Tashi, dear, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The medicines that doctors gave him to break his heart had begun to lose and leave his body.
He was out of luck before he died and now he started to stop the work of all systems.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing what's going on.
I couldn't stand, cry or drink because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together."
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperouse, who now had his daughter, went to the airport with other passengers who didn't know anything about his escape.
"No one knew that," he said.
“I kept my heads in the ground and the pears flew all this time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible shock on this plane against Nadi.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Leinova’s mailbox cards prevent suicide on her own
Two women who lost their loved ones in death worked together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey have stuck to Walley's cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mr. Davis' son Tyler was 13, when he was suffering from depression, and 18 when he killed himself.
“I don’t want anyone older to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
45-year-old Mr. Davis, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a very exciting cook who had a lot of fun.
"Everyone knew him because of his laugh.
They always said that his smile would put the whole room to sleep."
Despite this, he ended before his death because he was “with those who were very bad.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he had taken his life.
Mr. Davis said, "I'm constantly concerned that it has a domino effect."
Mr. Davis wrote these cards “to let people know that there are people to turn to and talk to, even to their friends.
Don't be silly. You have to talk."
Mr. Humphrey, who has been a friend to Mr. Davis for years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say that he would feel bad or be depressed or anything," he said.
“We noticed a change in her behavior a few days before she arrived.
He was at his lowest point during the first Christmas celebration – if the children opened their nests, he had neither eyes nor eyes with them."
Dr. Humphrey said that the death of a man had a terrible trauma for them, but they had to do so: “This is a rebuff to the entire family.
It's gonna turn us into pieces.
But we must go on and on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on the haircut, while the FBI starts the investigation
"I believe that if we could actually get something that he wanted – limited time and research – we could perhaps achieve unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the Committee would "come together" would be a permanent cause of ambiguity among the parties.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate this?
Their resistance was due to time.
The difference is five weeks later, on 6 November. If the Republican classes do not arrive in a waiting time, they are usually weakened by their plans to get the man they want to be in the highest court in the world.
George W. Bush has received a phone call to call the senators, doing lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush's White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bushi's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI submits its report?
The vote will take place in a Senate of 51 republics and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to vote at least 50 votes in senate, which will enable Vice-President Mike Pence to vote in favour of the decision-making vote and the Supreme Court of Kavanaugh.
The number of people in North Korea is "injurious" under the Kimi government
South Korea's law has said that the number of North Korea's population in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong arrived seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing the data from the Ministry of South Korea's Coordination, said that their number had fallen in comparison with the 2011 population (2706) last year (1127).
Mr. Park said that the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and more than one person dealer.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
A large number of North-Easters have been offered citizenship in South Korea.
According to the newspaper Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized area between two Koreas.
China adopts foreign nationals longer than refugees and often sends them back to their homes.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still in war, have apparently improved with the last six months.
At the beginning of this month, two countries must meet in Pyongyang to hold negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between US Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work in the nuclear-weapon-free South-East of Korea.
On Saturday, however, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of lack of progress in sanctions.
"Untrusted United States of America, our country lacks security and in any way we have no agreement to make ourselves the first weapon," said Mr. Ri in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelos named Brett Kavanaugh'd "instinctive" and said that the man is an impenetrable judge of the Supreme Court.
The opposition leader, Nancy Pelos, named Judge Brett Kavanaugh's "instinctive" and said that he is a man who is temporarily unable to work as Judge of the Supreme Court.
Pelos published an opinion during a Saturday interview in Texas Austin at the Texas Tribune Festival.
"I have noted without a hint that if a woman had appeared in such a way, she would have been treated as hysterical," Pelos said about his reaction, which had not been reported before the Senate's Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotionally accusing that he had been sexually assaulted by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were court-martials.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his open statement, his family and high school students describing him for a time almost tense and became a speaker.
He also clearly understood that there were members of the Democratic Party in the Committee, calling the charges against him Hillary Clinton for the loss of the presidential elections in 2016 organised by the angry liberals "great and co-ordinated".
In Pelos he believes that Kavanaugh's confession proved that a man is not fit to be a judge of the Supreme Court because it showed that he was denied democracy.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with their ideas and ways of attacking Clinton and Democrats," he said.
The game became a retrospective when she was asked if she was trying to get Kavanaugh back from her office if the Democrats should get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I say so much – if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he does not fit not only as Judge of the Supreme Court, but he does not fit at the trial where he is currently working,” said Pelos.
Kavanaugh is now the judge of the District Court of Columbia.
He was afraid that he was concerned about the decisions that he had adopted in Kavanaugh's possible Affordable Care Act (notice of the translator) or Roe v. Wade's (notice of the President of the Court of Justice of the Court) because he was considered a conservative judge.
In his statement of assurance, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would annul some of the decisions of the Court.
“It is not the time for a person called a hysterical person to become a judge and wait for us to say whether it is not a good one,” Pelos said.
And women have to wear it.
It's a fair word, six-and-a-year-old anger, and it doesn't get used to it.
"We'll wake up when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
He continued: “I got help from a woman who was in charge; she said that she would also cry when she got angry, but she developed a method that was in order to get angry and start shouting at someone she would say to him: “You can think that I’m upset because I’m hurt.
I'm angry."
And she just kept going.
And I thought it was genius."
Pisars are partially accepted as poison because they are basically understood as false.
One of my greatest memories is that of one former office with most men at work, where I once found myself in a state of unconsciousness as one older woman – a hard leader who I had always been a little scared – I was in the middle of a coma and in the water of a stairwell.
"Never show them a hug," he said to me.
“They don’t know you’re a nightmare.
They think you're sad and it gives them satisfaction."
Patricia Schroeder, a distinguished member of the Democratic Party Congress of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart for presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart left Monkey Business on a boat with an extramarital affair and ended the campaign, he was deeply impressed by the fact that there was no reason why he should not think of himself as a presidential candidate.
"This was not a well thought-out decision," he said to me, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates and the last thing they needed was another union."
Someone said it's like "The White and the Seven Tablets."
Since the campaign was over, he was late in collecting money and he made sure that he didn't apply for two million dollars.
The act was an unexpected battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who gave him 1,000 dollars gave him the most 250 dollars.
"Do they think I'm getting a favor?" he thought.
When he kept talking where he announced that he was not going to launch an official campaign, he felt — thanks to the people who supported him, the shock of the system that made it difficult for him to return to the election instead of the money and the delegates, and the anger against sexism — he was so overcome that he had a broken neck.
"You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Schroeder's press reaction to him.
‘I could have thought Kleinex was my sponsorship.
I remember thinking about what they're writing to my locker.
"He's gone?"
How the US-China Trade War can be useful to Beijing
The U.S. and China's trade wars were brutal, and although the war is not far over, the national divide between Beijing may be beneficial in a long-term perspective.
The US President Donald Trump made the first warning this year by establishing important taxes on Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important scaling took place this week with new tariffs relating to the value of 200 billion dollars (150 billion yen) in the value of goods, setting in-depth taxes on goods arriving in China from the United States.
Beijing has consistently responded by spending 60 billion dollars on US goods with prices of up to five to ten percent.
China has been forced to leave the United States to respond to the challenge, and the world's second largest economy is probably not so visible.
Getting back to Washington would mean complying with the requirements, but publicly, public worship before the US would be too painful for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that when Beijing leaves its cards correctly, trade war with the US can support China in a long-term perspective, reducing the mutual dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing may create conditions which may lead to the loss of control of the economy in another country is indeed much more dangerous than the authorities have previously acknowledged," said the report Abigail Grace, focusing on Asia's research centre for New American Security.
The Foreign Minister said Syria is ready for the return of refugees
In Syria, the State is prepared to return refugees voluntarily and asks for more than seven years after the war to rebuild the country.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam said that the situation in the country would improve.
"The situation in the territory of the country is now more stable and safer thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government will continue to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions that refugees who have left the country may voluntarily return to the country because of terrorism and the economic and social consequences of the day-to-day action.
According to the UN forecast, 5.5 million refugees have fled from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moulam said that the Syrian regime would take good care of the construction of a restored country.
At the same time, he stressed that the State would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries which supported the resumption.
Europe's Haara in Paris overcomes Ryder's military attacks
In 2018 the European team won the fight against Ryder in France near Le Golf National in the Gulf of Paris with the US team's final score of 16.5 vs 10.5.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on Europe's surface and has not won Ryder's caricature in Europe since 1993.
Europe received the crown again when Captain Thomas Bjorn's team received 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
During the entire tournament, the U.S. star Phil Mickelson won a prize at the Par-3 border 16 waters, creating a victory for Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfman Molinari watched in all his events by sending one of the four players who have won the tournament in 1979 a format that was released at 5:0 :0 .
The American Jordan Spiejät was the result of a 5'4" Tatlane Thorbjorn Olesen, which is at the bottom of the European team.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, presented with 2 and 1 English Ian Poulter, who was able to stay with Ryder for the last time.
Of the eight Ryder's vetting veteran, the Spanish Sergio Garcia received the most winning Europlan with 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t sleep, but today I can’t keep myself back.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got it back.
It is a matter of teamwork and I am glad to be able to help," said emotional Garcia after Europe won.
He's giving the lead to his fellow Jon Rahm, who won the only game in the United States golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
"I feel the extraordinary honour of winning Tiger Woods – I grew up looking at him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four races in France and now he's got a career on Ryder's career as a result of the fighting attacks. 13:21 :3 .
A random statistics for one of the best players of all time, who has won the title of 14 great matches, leaving only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was in the middle of a whole week's fairway encounter; except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the top golf course during the whole tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk, who prepared a report after the team’s misbehavior, said: “I’m proud of the dogs, they were heartbroken.
There was a moment in the morning when we published a lot of stress on Europeans.
We fought them.
There must be Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players did a really good job.
We're going to get together, I'm going to work with the American PGA and our Ryder's Cracking Committee, and we're going on.
I love them 12 guys and I feel proud to be their captain.
We need to get up.
We played better."
New information on water pollution: concentration decreased in Pinellas, Manatees and Sarasotas
The most recent report from the Florida Fisheries and Life-Staff Commission (FWC) shows a reduction in generally occurring protein concentrations in the Tampa area.
The FWC says that there are reports of the most degrading behaviour in the areas of Pineles, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which refers to reduced concentrations.
The sea level is about 130 miles (209 km) past the coast of Pinnels in the north of the province of Lee in the south of the province.
The times may be 10 miles (16 km) from the coast of Hillsborough, but there have been fewer than a week ago.
Water traffic has also been observed in Pasco.
In the past week, there have been reports of the mean concentration in the region of Pinella on the coast or at sea, Hillsborough on the ground from low to high on the sea, Manatee on the ground from back to high on the coast and Sarasota on the ground and the sea from back to high on the ground, Charlotte on the ground to middle on the ground, Lee on the coast and the sea on the back to high on the ground, and Collier on the ground on the ground.
There are still reports of respiratory irritation in Pinelene, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier countries.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in the past week in the herd-Florida.
