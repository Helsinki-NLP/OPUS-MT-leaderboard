Four members of the Kemerovo Group were arrested in Estonia and Spain.
According to the postman, the police in Spain arrested the leader of the Kemerovo group in Estonia, known as Slava Kemerovski, who is known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski.
In Spain, Gulevish was arrested on the grounds of trial.
Last night the court also took three suspects in Estonia.
According to the suspicion, the 27-57-year-old live with members of the criminal community of Kemerovo who are mainly involved in drug abuse.
A alleged leader of the criminal community was arrested in the province of Malaga, Spain.
In Estonia, three men were regarded as suspicious, one of whom has been collected as a guide of the criminal community and two are members of the criminal community.
The data collected indicate that the tasks and roles were clearly shared in the criminal community.
The purpose of the Community’s activities was to introduce drug abuse and thereby serve as a criminal benefit,’ said the director of the criminal proceedings of the State Prosecutor’s Office, Vahur Verte.
"We are not surprised that the circle of suspects in this crime area is increasing," the prosecutor added.
This has been done with people who have also been involved in the interest of law enforcement authorities, and some of them have been sentenced for drug abuse.
Blood stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become normal for us and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," said Dr. Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Office, said that a six-and-a-a-half-year review of detentions had taken place.
"In the first half of the long-term realization of the work and at the same time we held a hold on the crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
It was found that the Central Criminal Police officers were helping to arrest Spain.
For years we have had good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and the civilian card.
These arrests are successive messages for criminals to be received from another part of Europe," Leis said.
The information collected so far indicates once again that the suspects may continue to commit new crimes during their stay, so the prosecutor requested their detention and the court also approved it.
A man imprisoned in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia.
In the context of this criminal offence, there are fixed assets, vehicles and cash seized to ensure confiscation.
The criminal justice procedure shall be carried out by the Office of the Crimes organised by the Central Criminal Police and shall be conducted by the Public Prosecutor.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court found Slava Gulevitch guilty and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulević was considered second in the criminal world of Estonia, following the example of Nicolai Tarankov of Toona.
Gulevitš, born in Kemerov, grew up in the lower part of Estonia in the early 1990 ’ s when he began to deal with forced eviction in Tallinn.
He was alleged to have paid taxes on tax leaders and prostitutes operating at different hotels and demanded from the industry any charge.
International joint operations, the confiscation of proceeds of crime and the enforcement of judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the last sentences of eight convicted persons from the criminal community of Dikajevi, who were convicted of a crime amounting to EUR 80 000, or of nine persons, that Igor Aleynikov committed in 2006 a criminal Community aimed at illegal trafficking in secret contracts and the conduct of crimes related to human trafficking in East and South Estonia.
There is about EUR 71,500 for confiscated criminal revenue.
In these criminal cases, it has been a success for police officers to exchange information and evidence with foreign colleges every day and, where necessary, to carry out operations together in any country of the European Union.
The Civil Rights Group warns on its journey to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned against the policies and racist attacks of the State against the people who travel to Missouri.
The statement of the Group states: "The NAACP travel mark issued on the part of Missouri, which shall apply until 28 August 2017, calls on all Afro-American passengers, visitors and passengers throughout the country to be particularly cautious and extremely cautious, taking into account the long-term and long-term racist events that have taken place over the country."
According to NAACP, the Group was encouraged to issue a travel warning on both a recent Missour law making it more difficult to overcome discrimination-related cases, as well as the fact that the objectives of the State's regulators are quite unequally limited.
"People's rights are violated.
They are dragged by their skin color, beaten or killed," NaaCP Missouri Haru President Rod Chapel said in The Kansas City Star newspaper.
"We've never received complaints so often before."
This is the first such warning issued by the organisation on the United States.
The group referred to events such as racist massacres of black students at the University of Missouri and Tennessee, 28-year-old Tory Sanders' death.
Sanders died at the beginning of this year in suspicious circumstances after he was taken out of the country by a gas station and was taken by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, it refers to a recent report by the Major Prosecutor of Missouri that shows that cars of black cars are stopped in the country by 75% more likely than those of white sharks.
"The note is designed to make people aware and to warn their family, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be ready, then, to take out cash or to inform relatives that they are going through the country."
On the basis of the latest data from the FBI's hate reporting programme, 100 hate incidents were documented in Missouri in 2015 which will be reported in accordance with paragraph 16 of the State Code.
The call for travel is also a response to the new law of Missouri, which makes it difficult to appeal to the court of the company for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union ACLU had issued earlier travel comments on Texas and Arizona after those countries adopted immigration legislation which obliged local people to protect from the violations of immigration, as ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs usually issues travel warnings on other countries, but has recently begun to use this measure as a response to certain internal laws and trends in the United States.
Hepatitis: What can each know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis may be caused by five different types of hepatitis A, B, C, D and E.
All of these viruses are calling for a payoff to keep the fuel burning.
However, there is chronic hepatitis B and C which can continue to develop liver cirrhosis, i.e. liver cortification and liver failure.
The Health Agency’s epidemiologist, Kulo Kutsar, says that the acute diseases of hepatitis are all types of fever, fatigue, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, vomiting, abdominal pain, manageable rashes, headache, muscle pain, muscle pain and skin and skin problems.
The most recent outbreak of disease is also caused by the official name of the tax collector.
In children, hepatitis can be treated without infection.
The various types of taxable persons can be determined only on the basis of laboratory data.
The chronic hepatitis may pass into chronic hepatitis and continue for decades without disease, which means that a person does not have to know anything about his or her dangerous liver.
Hearing Kutsar brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes their way closer.
Hepatitis A virus spreads from disease to humans and touches us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, by excrement from people's hands and hands to food, surfaces, substances, mouth, and drug use.
People with chronic liver problems, people with diabetes, men with sex, men with drugs, people with high prevalence of hepatitis A, visitors to countries with high levels of hepatitis A.
Vaccination can be prevented by vaccines, in particular for many people travelling and patients at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet the hygiene requirements daily: wash or disinfect your hands before eating all the fruit and vegetables.
Hepatitis B virus spreads into the infected person’s blood, injecting drugs, tattooing, August, use of contaminated substances (dangerous,
The risk group of hepatitis B infection is injecting drug addicts, abused human sexual partners, sexually abused men, abused mothers, sick family members and caregivers, blood and other health workers and police officers, and visitors to the state of high disease with hepatitis B.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular it is recommended to vaccinate people belonging to the risk group and in addition to chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
The other preventive measures for hepatitis B are: maintenance of iron hygienic and manicure agents, other means of maintaining and injecting needles, tattooing and austerity, and use of condoms in case of pregnancy or sexual risk.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immune plan and free for children in Estonia.
Hepatitis C virus spreads in combination with human blood, injecting drugs, tattooing, August, use of contaminated substances, dodoriline, hepatitis, and hepatitis/response.
The risk groups of hepatitis C infection are injecting drug addicts, infected human sex partners, sex partners, pregnant men, sick family members and caregivers, blood and other health workers and police personnel, HIV infected persons, and visitors to countries with high hepatitis C infection.
The prevention of hepatitis C is: keeping track of the use of red hygienic and manicure agents, other means of surveillance and injection needles, tattooing and drying, and use of condoms in case of condoms.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D causes hepatitis D virus, which increases the presence of hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or with chronic hepatitis B infection.
Hepatitis D viruses spread in contact with blood and other body organs, contaminated with injection needles, genetically and rarely abused mothers.
The risk group D is chronic hepatitis B virus agents and non- people who are not immune to hepatitis B.
The effective preventive measures are vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine that also protects a person from hepatitis D infection.
E-Hepatitis virus spreads throughout the country with food and food, including less heat-treated meat, fish and amalgamated eggs, dodoriline, joint injections and mixed mother-in-law hope.
Travelers may be affected by the high incidence of hepatitis E in countries.
E-Hepatitis prevention measures are to comply with hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after taking a toilet before preparing and eating, after taking care of the disease.
Farmers should be treated before consumption, avoid eating less heat-treated meat, fish and seaweeds, dry only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
Although during the last round, competitors tried to cross the border four-time Olympics, 34-year-old Farah found strength and won 26.49.51.
Farah did not think long after she finished her term with her husband, Tanya, and children.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
It was wonderful to be with them," said Farah to the journalist.
Farah runs a five - foot - long [5000 m] gold dubs in London.
It's all possible if you believe it.
In spite of its title, Anne-Marie O'Connor "Dadam worships. Gustav Klimti's masterpieces, Adele Bloch-Bauer portrait" is an extraordinary story of one of the births of art marked by a deeper 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century on wine culture.
But more detailed history.
The cost of an open-label information store may be more difficult to obtain in a tighter frame of reference than in the title of a portrait.
There would now be just two books between the two sides: Gustav Klimti and Adele Bloch-Bauer's story described on his land in "Dadam's Christmas" and mark a deeper and broader history of respected Jewish communities and German occupation with its consequences in Austria.
The book’s first third leads to the centrally pollinating wine culture and who has been the head of Austria itself, at least it may be hard to imagine how more than a hundred years ago life in Ringstra’s environment or how all you had to return to Central coffee when you were in trouble with the climate.
In one rich city in Europe, there was a high concentration of culturalists who, when they saw the name of the book, felt more grammatical than it was.
For example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was active in a city where there was no drug use and was the European highest level of suicide, created without giving anything to development.
Or perhaps, however, every pair of colorful carpets adds color to the culture of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Holiday dream from the Union of the Councils
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews had grown dramatically in Vienna, becoming the largest community of Jews in Western Europe.
In the first century C.E., there were Jews from every ten inhabitants of the wine.
Adele’s parents were also new immigrants in Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself twice to Chechnya’s sugarcane Ferdinand Blochi and Klimti for his famous paintings, his father had already become a large seventh bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adelet didn't give up all this glamorous life where he belonged.
Looking at "Dadam in the Church", it is hard to believe that this great lady of socialism and dreamt of traveling from the Union of the Councils.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband's portrait from Klim, he was the last hottest painter in Vienna.
At the time, the air conditioner paid $4,000 for the price of the country.
The fact that some portraits were suspected of using the master's loving model did not inspire the sugarcane.
As for Adele, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist was the end of life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor--"Dam always.
Gustav Klimti's masterpieces, Adele Bloch-Bauerie portrait", Varrak 2016, translated from Aldo Randmaa into English.
Just before the start of the work, Klimt had gone to Ravennas San Vitale's basal base, and researchers believe that the brilliant mosaics seen there as the emperor of Theodora gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a colored mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Dadam gold" in Vienna in 1908 and about the same time (1907-1908) was born in another gold country.
The similarity between two women in art fields has not yet been noted.
How is Hitler related to creation?
"I think my friend Klimti's memory I owe him to make his work available to the public," wrote Adele Bloch-Bauer a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family to go to the museum.
Six years before the death of Klim, Adele had prepared another portrait.
She also asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four Gustav Klimti to the Austrian National Gallery.
She gave birth to her cousins Maria and Louise.
A year after Klimt had finished "Austria Mona Lisa" he had tried to access 17-year-old Adolf Hitler's Academy of Fine Arts.
Although Hitler is sometimes considered to be the reason for his later anti-Semitism because Jewish professors did not accept him into academia, none of his professors were really Jews.
In any case, Maria’s assignment as an Austrian Galleri was markedly changed by 1939 - it was important to find satisfying work for the Nazis from the wealthy Jewish art congregations in Vienna.
Some of Adele's work at home was also suitable for the personal art of Hitler, but not for the climate itself.
Sixteen years after the birth of the Nazi art series, the ten-year dispute between the Austrian Government and the Bloch-Bauerites began.
Here it is only noted that when "Shutdown" sees the wine in Belvedere, Adele Bloch-Baueret depicting the "Dadam tower" must be seen driving into the New York New Gallery.
And before the wine drive read the above book.
Even when you were looking at climate work, I didn't plan to go, because at least my emotions bothered me after the closure of the book more than 135 million dollars for the land and model sold around Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not as much as portraits, as long as the story of arrival - and very moving story.
It is noteworthy that in events, orientation was facilitated by the birth of Bauer’s descendants from the beginning of the book.
The 17-year-old whore was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
The solution was that Gold itself was very close to the personal record of 200 m of the settlement by 2.16.62.
Tippmark is born in 17 years of age almost a week from the time he was born at the age of 2.16.58 in the Canadian junior master’s degree.
Gold finally got to the 10th A final.
At the end, he spent 2,15,76 hours in the distance and reached a close seven-place with a new powerful peak.
Of the Estonian record of Alina Kendziori (2.15.13), Gold was released almost half a second.
At the top of all the Estonian times, Gold grew to the third and its fresh personal topmark is the fifth result of all the Estonian times.
Young future development in Canadian adult mastering is still starting in 100 m, 200 m and 400 m of release and 200 m and 400 m of complexion.
Last week in Toronto, Canada's junior high school, Gold also started a successful career there.
He won 200 m in release at 2.03.22.
So fast was this distance from Estonia last year in 2008.
More quickly than gold, this distance has taken place in Estonia than in Estonia. Only the Estonian recordmaker Elena Partákáka.
The life of Estonia in Canada also won the proxcsmedal 100 m release with a great personal record and 56.66 of the new Estonian airstrip.
For example, his older brother, Kertuta Ly Alnek, has taken this distance only as fast as a century ago.
He reached his personal tipmark at another 100 m in explanation of notice in the opening letter of 1,03.69.
At least half of the distance, he reached only seven times the final 2.17.31.
Gold is currently running the Estonian Hoaaja table at four different distances.
President Trump is going to rest. Critics shake their teeth.
The time of vacation is in hand - it means a break to US President Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has already taken out one day of rest, critics are already spreading rumors.
The United States Today and CNN's presidential plan has a 17-day holiday at the own golf club in Bedminster, which is located in New Jersey.
Although the president's break began last night, Trump's opponents have already spoken on the subject of peace for a week.
They're spreading too much rest to Trump.
On behalf of the President, it is customary to take a week's shift in their forests of Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
At the museum, Trump has not spoken in his 196 days of office.
For example, George W. Bush was able to rest at this time for 67 days, but Barack Obama half less than Trump, only 21 days.
But it's time for Trumpil to forget things quickly.
A few days after being sent to the president, Trump said "60 minutes" would not last long vacations during his official's absence, as much is needed to do.
He also announced three years ago the terrible rest of Barack Obama.
The current president wrote on Twitter: "When Obama is at rest, he plays golf, walks in parties and jäskoncerts, he's going to beat the ISIS reporters out of his face."
The White House officials' announcements do not include a 17-day golf club visit exactly any Saturday.
It is officially referred to as a high-speed job break which does not take time to read or otherwise for memory activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for the rest of the work.
The name is replaced by the Western Conditioning System of the White House and therefore the entire staff had to leave.
The West also has Ovaalkabin and other presidential working rooms.
"I don't think anyone else would want to be western in August if there were 38 degrees and no conditioner," said the White House speaker Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue working during the holiday.
From where President Trump's gonna be going in 17 days, you're gonna have to watch the video.
Blocking criticism from Facebook don't apply to the government office unless you hear the criticism of voters
Our country's father knew something about the unfair media show.
The Americans loved George Washington, but newspapers didn't go long to try to push him away from everything from internal politics until he got out of politics.
Criticism naturally upset him.
But he didn't force his critics to act.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of speech can be taken away from us and can lead us to the massacres in the dark and in the weak."
It brings me to Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who needs to find it hard to be more like Washington.
The Hogans have blocked and deleted at least 450 people who published their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And for the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU appealed to the US Civil Liberties Union.
The Kuberner's official team was in the temple as an empty and web-based comment from the response style "Who's interested?".
"This is the most Facebook," said many.
But it'll read.
And it'll be a lot of fun when it's done with a man like Hogan.
The act is an amazingly popular government with a sovereign overarching in a democratic country.
His percentage of approvals is better within the State's 50 Governors elsewhere.
Hogan is not an unintended reactive brain.
He has firmly taken the lead in the country and has kept his principles clearly in mind.
In addition, he has used the main instrument in his interview with his voters on Facebook, presenting for example after the first time after the chemotherapy you have to leave your bottle.
Therefore, a public forum with official labelling is a public forum that manages the blocking of staff visiting people who are paid from the dollars of taxpayers is unnecessary and dangerous in the final stages.
President Amelia Chase protected The Washington Post's interview with the governor's behaviour, claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than a modernization.
But it's too easy to paint an image on the web of mobile Internet patrols, gangposters or hate people in general.
The Post interviewed a number of pretty people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that's exactly what they're really people dealing with their chosen leaders. Teacher, company owner and pastor, not Internet patrols.
They all said that their comments were respectful, modest, and of course not.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, stressing Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Maryland from Bowie didn't get angry, but rather about hate crimes.
"I commented wisely that I have been deceived because he has not responded to anger and other recent news," he wrote in The Post's commentary section.
"I also do not like the idea that if more and more people comment on the same subject, some immediately appoint it as a collective effort rather than to acknowledge that it is a matter of concern to citizens."
What the Governor's official group called "designated for a gang post", others would probably call it "public aid".
Facebook time allows you to easily adapt messages by simply blocking criticism or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than older than when workers were sent out to do the same so that they could gather with critical guidebooks and burn them or arrest the protesters and force them to act.
But that's exactly what's going on right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official to be criticised for using Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has been arrested by Twitter users who have blocked his Twitter voice.
One of the first landmark decisions on this subject was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris decided in Alexandria that the presence of the Loudun State Supervisory Council failed to improve the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked the vote on his Facebook page.
Kentuckys also visited ACLU Facebook and Twitter after the use of Governor Matt Bevinit (R).
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington, there was a similar impact on local mail costs than on the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800 the quadruple of newspapers and anonymous writers undermined his way of governing.
And even then Washington had to cross the border with anonymous trolls.
People wrote to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, making Washington’s decisions on the ground.
In accordance with the historical documents compiled in the framework of the web-based collection of books by George Washington, he visited the office under petitions that he criticised his position with regard to the friendship, trade and shipping agreements concluded with Britain.
But he didn't force them.
Freedom of speech, opinion and debate are our country's starting points.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty is expected by Renaissance Clubs to be at home
The only European President, Ronan Rafferty, is expected to be at home during the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open is held on the East Lothanan Renaissance Club golf course.
The Northern Ireland, which was in the vicinity of the Archerfield Links last round before Paul Eales' fall, has been impressed by the new location of the event and is playing the role of the director and director of the club instead of Jerry Sarvadi.
"I see how Renaissance Club was built, and now we see how the club is going to break down with this event in complete wonder," said Rafferty.
"The players see the race in their best form, it's in a cold condition.
Jerry's done a great job at setting this place up.
He's a soft golf player and he feels like he's not getting here.
This allows the row to be presented in a great way."
English Eales is looking forward to the first time he can protect the master's title, although he has won his 32-year career in both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"It gets a very special feeling," said a lawn player in Southport.
"I couldn't protect my Extramadura Open title, because it was taken years after my victory from the competition calendar.
It's magic to come back to this position.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember memories of last year, my wife and I had a special victory last year for Sharon.
It was a very special time that we will always bear in our hearts."
Gary Orr, who joined the European market at the beginning of this year when he was 50, will return to the competition.
This is his first experience in Scotland since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"The home to play is always a little more important," said the Helensburg man Orr.
"You can do well, but you also feel extra effort.
I've enjoyed playing again so much and I've shown pretty good golf.
I'm content to walk in it."
The Trigo joins with former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder's warrior Captain Sam Torrence are two of the six contestants, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Access is free and car parking pays one passenger car 5 times and two or more passengers 10 times.
All income goes to the charity organization Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesia on gold mines
When Bardina Degei prepares dinner, he doesn't use a plate.
He's even using a pot of paper.
In Indonesia’s province of Papau, Panai, the capital of Enorotal, the capital of the province of Pania, is located in the building of the home of a native language note.
Within half an hour, the injured person shall be taken from the other side of the body and shall be given without washing his hands with a needle.
Degei sits on the other floor with no furniture and also does his daily household chores, for example, washing the sand from the nearby spring water.
The role of the walker will be played without covering in the room.
Since she is more than four of her husband’s wives, she has not been appointed to care for any farm.
Polygamy is normal here.
However, working late may be dangerous for most of the men who are working and many of them are eating hard, and there are still soldiers here.
"Don't nobody encourage anyone to walk around for who five nights," she says.
This is a rare insight into the life of the Pope in the Magi. This is with the former Dutch colony, which was associated with Indonesia under 1969, with a referendum that forced 1026 elderly people to vote in the eyes of the public.
The movement of freedom from the Dutch authorities led to its rapid attack on the Government of Jakarta, which keeps the region under its strong control by keeping out foreign journalists and human rights observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into the pope and the Western Pope, so that the pope himself remained in the eastern part of the island.
Enorotal is a uniform way both far and far. To reach this destination, you need to fly from the capital of Jayapura to Nabires 90 minutes and then cross the five-hour drive that you want to drive with your car.
There's no common transport.
About 19,000 live cities are made up of trees surrounded by bamboo branches and cut down from the melodious layers of iron, which have turned into different tons of gold.
A very small number of Indonesians have taken the initiative here, not to mention journalists, nor have they gone to almost any foreign country.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the popes of Mee Pago worshiped God by the name Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We haven't used to wear such clothes," says Degei, referring to his colorful hand with a turban, a dark flux and a sharp neck.
"Before we put it on the body, we only put it on a plant leaf."
The pope is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28% of the people live below the poverty line and the statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are one of Asia’s worst.
But it's also an Indonesian gold mine.
More than 100 km from Pania, which is about 153,000 inhabitants in the province of New Jersey, the world’s largest and most productive gold mine is Grasberg, which belongs to Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport recovered about 3.1 billion dollars of gold and silver.
In addition, the pope can be honored with consumer goods worth $78 billion.
However, these defects are the source of the suffering of the papacy, as they result in a strong hot spot for Indonesian soldiers.
A 2005 study in The New York Times showed that Freeport was spending some 20 million dollars on local military and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 for one leader.
The efforts of the pope to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gold and make it more attractive.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 popes have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killing of genocidal agents in the countries that belonged to the papaya in the 1970s was a mass killing of genocids.
Last year alone, more than 3300 peace-keeping protesters were detained by the Indonesian police in the area.
The 2016 report "We all lose" of the main summit of the Birsbane in 2016 contains testimony to the effects of previous year's conditions such as extrajudicial infringements, torture (according to another report, violence and the provision of electricity) and the strong decline of peaceful entertainment.
"The number of victims is hard to read, as such incidents occur every week," says researcher Andreas Harrisono of the Human Rights Watch of Indonesia.
The Kruvids are even more strongly attached because the nature resources of the Pope have caused news from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the population of the province are Christians, but demography is changing, as the Indonesian population of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes are experiencing economic migration.
Family farms are sold as cattle and cattle farms by gado-gado, which is served together with the groundnut.
The locals can't fight them.
"Migrands started selling bananas and vegetables in a traditional local market with their leaves," explains 24-year-old Abeth You, who worked in the capital of the province of Jayapura.
"For this reason, the poppies of the farmers are losing their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widododo, known as Jokowi, allowed his 2014 election campaign to deal with their inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
The only step-by-step was to win over Jakarta Presidential Pope 29 from the 27th electoral district, including Panai.
But the pope has changed a lot, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014, we voted by Jokowi in the hope that he will fulfill our hopes in restoring justice," You says.
In fact, Panya suffered from the most two months after the fall of the office of Jokowi in October.
On 7 December 2014, 11 children in Enarotal sang at the end of the Christmas season when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the darkness.
The kids who met told them they were supposed to turn in.
According to the local pastor Yaved Tebai, one of the soldiers struck down on their ballot and returned with four soldiers later.
In the words of the victims and the spectators, the soldiers beat the children behind them and beat them with their fists.
Then one of the soldiers shot a child's ass.
One boy, 16-year-old Julianus Yeim, was so excited that he fell into coma.
A few hours later, the next election committee was set up to burn down the building and the next day the issue was still on schedule.
About 1,000 young Popes gathered together to demand justice from the local police department and the military control centre.
They wore seremonial shoes and presented the Pope's home with a walk of waiting dances, during which they walked around and traveled by flight.
Some of the protesters were starting to stop the police and the military.
In recent times, an order was sent to the military via inside radio. "If there are more than three times opposition in the population, let them down," said the official document, which has seen the TIME newspaper, but which has not been issued to local media sources.
The city of Kego Koto in the city of Yeremias Kayame (56) recognized the threat and called for peace, asking people to go home.
No one wanted to hear it.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the back of my stomach," he said to the newspaper TIME in its early colors on the blood of trees.
We still don't know who the gunman was, but he says he's got picked up from the soldiers' wheels.
"The people were very, very brave," he adds.
The local man, Alfius Youw, was shot three times by a snake who saw him.
"I ran to him and examined his body through to make sure it was with him," said the Timesman of the Times of John, who uses the combination of many Indonesians only one name.
"So that he's dead... I kissed him."
The chief of police, Yotje Mende, told the reporters that his bosses only returned the security of his department because it was attacked.
"We have to protect ourselves when we are threatened with murder," said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistyo, President of the Papau Police in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
Human Rights Watch data killed five young protesters and were severely injured.
The next day, the news of the murders reached Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapura held a silent talk in which he shared his feelings with the families of the victims and allowed him to deal with the atrocities that took place in Papua.
"I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said that he would establish an external justice mechanism to address crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately after the apologys.
"Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of these occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow a certain process," he said.
Speaking with TIME magazine on June 5, Jakartas, Wiranto took his words back, saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism in Papua to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said that "all will be resolved by law."
Wiranto, who has been charged by the United Nations with crimes against human rights in respect of more than 1,000 people killed in East Timor during the 1999 blood-self-resultation referendum, said that 11 of the crimes against human rights had already been resolved in Papua, including in Spain.
The families of the victims adopted such claims against the soul.
"What has been heard four times over in the last three years, but no progress has been made," said John.
"I'm tired."
He says years later there's still fear.
"I'm afraid," she says.
"I'm afraid the military will punish me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that Panai people are afraid of this incident.
He said he got a gun from the military after he had helped kill four victims.
"After the death of dead bodies, the soldier came looking for me," he says.
Fires haven't stopped.
On the other day, the Indonesian police shot the visitors of Panai in the nearby area of Deia.
One person was killed and 17 injured, including children, when he went to speak between visitors and the head of the building company, who refused to transport a man unknown to the hospital.
In the male population, 24-year-old Ravianus Doww, who was caught by fish trying to reach a nearby nest, died on his way to the hospital.
Angered visitors protested at the building site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the visitors ended up with stones on which the last of them responded to warnings.
But the local authorities claimed that the mobile Brigade (the Indonesian Armed Police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in great panic, we were afraid of getting paid," said the 29-year-old Time Domingu Badi, who lives near the hospital and saw the introduction of injuries.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
Deiai Parliament has called for police responsibility related to this matter and for the withdrawal of a mobile police brigade from the region.
Panai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of measured development results in the dissatisfaction of men, women, many, Denmark and Denmark living in the prosperous Middle East.
Many of them have joined the Free Pope's Movement (VPL) forces to protect the rights of popes, in their own words, by organizing attacks and human interference in the presence of Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL leaders are from Spain, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response to this, the military "protection of the sovereignty of the State" has in the past few years captured in Spain and has voluntarily arrested thousands of people.
Some of them don't appear anymore.
In the pope's presence, Panyas is known as "tragically forgotten".
Poverty is a source of frustration.
The small rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive to buy locally.
There's the same thing that's not available.
People grow all their own food mainly by themselves, including a few trees and leaves.
Farming is the work of women who are able to care for four or five battalions.
They usually take care of most of the family, the rest sell on the local market.
Ten battalates only pay 10,000 Indonesian rubies (75 cents).
Over the course of time, economic imbalances have increased between fuel plants and new migrants, which have been largely achieved by opening new airports at the Nabire airport.
These small jobs, which are available, go better with educated and powerless migrants.
There is often a lack of capital or necessary skills in order to achieve a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying because there is no job or money here," said John Gobai, President of the Panai Board of Governors.
Disfellowshipping keeps the eyes of the world out of the way.
In addition, there are severe restrictions on external media.
At the beginning of this year, the French journalists Franck Escudie and Basil Longchamp were sent out by Pope, because "they did not follow the relevant customs", although they had received a rare film license.
The President of the Human Rights Watch Asia Division, Phelim Kine, has not been able to address the restrictions imposed on reporters for the promotion of transparency and development in the Jokowi elections.
"In Indonesia, the Pope is reporting on the most peaceful provinces in the eastern part of the world and reports from the Western Pope on the making of the new journalists threatening the return of the visa and the inclusion of the black list," he said in his statement.
The lack of a clear picture of journalism means that international stress is largely confined to the Indonesian government with the neighbours of the Pope.
In March six Pacific States of Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands encouraged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "some of the widespread crimes" in the Papua, including the shooting of Panai.
These countries have also historically supported the VPL.
The press spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arrmanatha Nasir, quoted the group's charges against Jakartas as saying to the journalist: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic rule and freedom of literature, so that the evidence of cases against human rights would be difficult to refute."
Local people want more attention from foreign governments.
When the official Dutch delegation, in front of the national human rights envoy Kees Van Bari on 4 May, visited Jayapurat, the local people who were sitting in the meeting stopped, but in an anonymous manner they wanted to remain the source of their influence, asking, "We want freedom."
New presidential elections are taking place in Indonesia in 2019, but the popes do not believe that they are voting again by Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a good man with good intentions, but people around him who are involved in the shooting of Panai," says Prime Minister Hobai.
He wants to help Jokowi understand that in addition to continuing to live under the threat of nuclear war, the people of Panai are under constant threat, they are in trouble because of Nigel education and health services.
In Gobai’s words, the people of Panai, as well as the other popes, must pay their daughter Jokowil for it.
"They don't need money, they want justice," she says.
Despite threats and intimidation, Panai's families were able to begin their last symbolic attack on the country opposite the police and military base of one victim.
Knowing that justice never fails, at least those responsible will never forget their sins.
"One of our family members has been killed," said Yacobus, after his release.
"What else can we do?"
It's been a while since the next time the Dubai Torch airship has arrived.
A number of residents were forced to flee from this 337 - foot - high and 79 - square - foot - high [337 m] building across one world.
This is the second loss of income that has been dropped from the high-speed, called the Torchi case, or the Tõrvikutornik.
The building was evacuated, no damage was reported and no direct damage was reported.
"We slept and woke up on a fire alarm and people's cry.
We would run down the stairs and we spent about 10 minutes to get down 50 times," said a resident named George.
According to the Dubai Civil Protection Officers, firefighters destroyed about 4 a.m. at local time (00.00 GMT) and freezing buildings.
The government said they work for torture in the name of guaranteeing capital.
This exchange can also raise questions about the safety of materials used at high-speed external level around the world.
In a study conducted after the 2015 corruption of the Torchi Board, it was found that the most harmful was the wearing of fassaads - the outer layer of decorative panels and isolation.
The British police have said they believe that London’s Greenfell Tower isolation and fassadial panels could contribute to the rapid spread of fire in June, where about 80 people died.
See: from these phones, you'll probably get big sales tickets.
There's a nice time for technical fans in the summer and deep, because then telephone manufacturers publish their new top models.
In the summer they came to sell Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium, and there is also waiting for new hit-telephones.
In the words of Christian Seed, the director of the market and sale, Te2, you will find today’s innovative design, eyeglasses, 4K-servicing screen and universal processor.
A great deal of learning was produced in the world of technology Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also been reached at the beginning of the Estonian Nuttelphone sales table.
The river also allows nightlife volunteers to be more speeded up, more resistant acutes, more quality cameras and greater water and air safety.
He added that on the basis of the hearings, it is already possible to make assumptions and predict four top models that are likely to control today's sales tables.
These four nutt-telephone top models are still coming to the puzzles in the middle of this year.
Remote iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should be able to reach the pools by mid-September.
You've heard what the new Apple model looks like and what it can do, it's spreading a lot.
If iPhone 7 did not significantly differ from iPhone 6s, Apple is expected to be completely different from the previous one for 10 birthdays.
There are four colors: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the new design elements is probably the screen that covers the entire phone show, has been lost, and the screen reader has been built into the screen.
Apple's designer director JohnnyIve requires that the new iPhone model look like a glass.
It's also about the ceramic version of iPhone.
In addition to the eyeglass scanner, control-free loading and even more quality camera, A11 processors can be expected.
I'm sure it's a one-year waiting phone.
Uhiue model Galaxy Note 8 preemption begins on August 23.
There's been a lot of hearings coming out of the new Galaxy Note 8.
Listenably, there are even more business users and S Pen allows even more functionality.
There should be two cameras, one of which is a license and the other with a longer view.
Now no one knows what two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case this is Samsung's first test, which is definitely comparable to iPhone 8 for quality.
But we'll wait until August 23rd.
Although Nokia has been selling three nuts in front of Nokia 6 this year, there is still a lack of them - Nokia 8, which is already presented on August 16.
We're waiting for the 5.3-hour finish-up of my screen and all the other Qualcomm Snapdrano 835 processors and the opposite battery.
In the case of nokia, there is also mention of aluminium corpus and significant levels of water and soil safety IP68.
Similarly with Samsung, Nokia has a new model of two reverse cameras that are produced by the company Zeiss.
If Sony is sure he has been up to the XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two Nut Phones will be added recently, with even more innovative features.
We're waiting for a cell phone that's a little more flexible than the XZ Premium, but at least the same with a good or better camera.
Sony's new model has been speculated that this screen is at least six degrees.
As a matter of fact, we can already see the right head because, traditionally, Sony has published his deep-rooted international technology at IFA, which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year.
In the case of phone-ticked transcripts, Trump Mexico insisted on paying for the limit.
The Washington Post published transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and the Heads of State of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27th, Trump phoned President Enrique Pena Nietto, Mexico, to stop public preaching, so that he did not intend to pay for an exemption.
The President of the United States spoke with him about the public destruction of the wall, saying, "You can't tell the press."
Trump set up his presidential campaign to build a long South-American bridge and commission to pay for this project in Mexico.
The transcripts were also published in his first address with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbul, which reveals the urgent exchange of ideas.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States of America takes on itself from Australia is "naerful", "narune" and "rumal". He claimed that the agreement made during the Obama government would leave her "juhmard" memory because he has offered refugees a ban on re-establishment in the United States.
The trumpet ended with the announcement to Turnbull that "the day was the most unpleasant thing to do".
The Court did not hold a debate on the complaint of OÜ MRP City Linna on which Tartu City withdrew its offer to acquire a bus line from July 2019 to 2029.
The application is accompanied by an order issued back by OÜ MRP City Lines on the Tartu bus project, since the offer did not comply with the requirements, explained Mr. Anneli Auphutin, President of the City Court of Justice of Tartu.
This is done for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
The MRP City Lines appealed to the Court of Justice of Tartu.
The Court did not take this procedure.
Although many in the social media complain that the spring of the Weekend festival interferes with their night and the whole city is full of fans, so there are many who are not in the sun to say anything bad about the long-term festival.
I've even been so impressed by the fact that there were so many wise people in trade!
I didn't see any difficulty or failure.
I've even seen a departure," says Laine.
"It's great to come, be and feel the joy of Pärnus, who's as cold as your winter," he adds with joy.
It's a tasteless Laine from the beach, and it doesn't bother.
If he still heard that music was played on the beach in the middle of his life, then now music has not yet reached his home.
"And I hope I hear," she says with joy.
Agnes, also speaking in the evening, says that the big party is better for Pärnu - it will help the local shopkeepers to walk.
In addition, he rejoices that the South Pacific has come to be so many foreigners.
You're afraid of a woman who loves you.
Even though I'm no longer on the beach, it's good that the beach is alive.
And it's good that people move and it's been three times," says the woman.
For the first time, it must have been a little worse.
"Then maybe there were complaints," he means.
But it's common for people in the south of the country to have sex.
"This weekend is a very good promotion for our little town," says Harri, a Parisian.
Mel and me haven't thrown her life into the hole.
But for nothing?!
We should all keep it together.
To think about how this international relationship would be better.
The choice of music doesn't make a man.
It doesn't matter if I live near it.
"Good people can keep together and there's no harm," he says.
The visitors who came to Pärnus are wise in his word.
"Of course they've gone a little too far with the puddles, but the young are young and the Lord God--can go, but be people and we can go!" he says.
The coastal inhabitants have been traveling anywhere during this time either to relatives or acquaintances.
"Even though the festival has a positive effect on life - names like that song," says Pärnus, who walks with children in China.
And his family and festival music did not interfere, although last year it lasted even longer than today.
Last summer there was a lot of ice cream, so we heard more.
We live out of the city itself, that it's actually going to be quite good along the river of Pärnu," she says.
Pearson still earns 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to restore business
Britain’s educational company Pearson has said in line that it will still reduce 3000 jobs and reduce 72% of its average wage by launching a business-threatening restructuring programme.
The lost jobs, combined with the high probability of John Fallon at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, will be added to the 4000 lost offices during the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced that it would reduce the costs of 300 million more (394 million US dollars) under the third cost reduction programme in order to try to restore the business that has been achieved by a rapid digital learning transition.
The company which agreed to sell to its partner company Penguin Random House last month said that their expectations for the year had not changed since sales revenue was reported to increase from 1 % to 2,05 billion in the first half of the year.
The sun continues to shine on the sun
In Estonia on Sunday, there will be a sudden rise in winter with the possibility of permanent winters, and windmills will be very strong.
Last night, there will be a dark explanation in Estonia.
There's a lot of interest on the other side, maybe it's too late.

Air temperature is 18-21 degrees.
Conference in Kabul: NATO army in self-defence
The President-in-Office attacked officials in Afghanistan in the capital of Kabul, killed one NATO soldier and wounded several others.
In NATO's statement, five soldiers and a translator were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the attempted deaths of the city in the Karabakhi region.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have killed Afghanistan this month - on the other day, more than 30 people were killed in the Herat massacre.
On the first day, the suicide bomber killed nearly two people in the area of Kabul Iraaga.
The NATO statement said that a four-day explosion occurred when the joint patrol was attacked by the Afghan army "by a man-made bomber".
According to the statement, all of them are damaged in a stable state and are treated at the U.S. military airport outside Bagram.
In the words of the correspondents, Taliban and group known as the Islamic Republic of Iran (ISIS), the ever growing force of Kararabagh is a serious barrier to the forces in NATO Bagram.
According to UN data, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, autopom killed at least 30 people in Kabul, mostly in the area of the news.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, a large bomb killed more than 150 people in the middle - it has caused the most deaths in the country since the U.S. raids on the Taliban as far as possible in 2001.
This violence emphasizes the insecure security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump considers whether to increase the number of United States forces assisting the military and the police.
According to the correspondents, the suicides in Kabul in recent weeks have led to the same public confidence crisis, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA cancelled after the decision to forward the Regulation
The United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA rejected the decision to speed up the establishment of the Obama-time Regulation, which obliges States to limit the greenhouse gas emissions one day after 15 countries appealed to the Agency for this action.
The EPA announced its decision to continue "on the three-day basis of the allocation of the 2015 allocation content", stating that it would show the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the countries concerned.
"We believe that we must engage in dialogue with our partners and listen to them," said EPA leader Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt had announced the intention to terminate the determination of the shareholding in which the national shareholding is measured in order to determine where this level should be reduced by one year to October 2018 in order to meet the strictest air quality standard.
The 15 main democratic countries submitted an application on the second day with Colombia, stating that this decision is illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to reverse several environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, which is part of the broadest economic growth market plan.
But these efforts have led to reactions to democratic and natural protection groups that have increased concern over the impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhalation of air contained in the ozone layer "may reduce the working power of the muscles and increase the risk of disease in respiratory diseases", for example, in asthma.
The Germans may have to come.
The German cheese and butter can be harvested as strong winds threaten the achievement of a second producer in the European Union, says Bloomberg.
Today, it can be said that weeks before the harvest season, the harvest may mean that the vine intended for the shipping industry is only for animals to eat.
"Nice quality is far worse than butter and stronger than in 2015,” said analyst Bernhard Chilla Agravis Raiffeisen.
Today, up to 40 percent of German wheat can be eaten twice as usual in Agravis's forecast.
German farmers, as well as their European colleagues, have been affected by all kinds of air.
First of all, it was too cold.
Then came the cold morning, which set the temperature in June.
In July, Germany died of diseases that continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned to North-Saxland, where the winter prevents the harvest.
Only five percent of the moisture has been used so far.
Most of the region has not yet benefited from the achievement, a local audience told Ceravis.
"This is quite a difficult day," said Ceravise's trader Frank Deckert Rendsburg.
Conformity at all times, perhaps plans for the internalisation of Finland
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the Mexicans, as through the great ages, the beautiful views of the Samia’s loved ones reach many (life) rooms.
In any event, our fundamentalists' efforts will be focused on creating both the cargoes and the complete (energy-sustainable) homes.
The aim and follow-up of the Finnish wood-use centre is to provide building and finishing materials, furniture and furniture.
The effective approaches and nuts solutions are found in the meshers both the builder and the (home) designer.
It is clear from this that black, white and yellow secret compounds, if they add wood tones and nutrients, can be very pleasant.
Good ideas can be made faster for another week, because the fair will last until 13 August.
The needs and heartsets suggest that this kitchen is often tried.
On the other hand, today, the evening before the weekend festival in Baltic, Martin Garrix gave everything he had to remember as the last performance.
During Garrix’s presence, the people were really turning around - a song, a joke, a dance.
At the end of Garrix, a common mass was lit across the city from Pärnu beach.
Let's get your gallery where there's all the pictures that our photographer's been trying for three days on the weekend.
I'm sure you're some of them, too. Find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible resistance
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be on the train course to go to the nearest poximachi area up to 66.7 kg of potassium category, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN office in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the winner of the World Boxing Council, traveled on the other side of the corridor to greet Lomachenkot, the World Boxing Organization’s closing event.
After a single decision by Garcia, the winner of the previous four-time World Minister, Adrian Broner, won the prize of the first round of the showtime showtime.
Garcia stretched out her left hand and said, "How are you doing, champ?
I want you to succeed."
Lomachenko protects his sword against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 19 o'clock in the ESPN.
When several photographs were taken, Lomachenko manager Egis Climate noted that there would be a "perfect balance" between the combatants.
"I'm an old shutter," said Garcia.
"I've moved up to the Booker [about 63.5 kg], but I'm not so big.
I'm 63.5 kg small.
I want to move down the stairs.
And he has to move over a light weight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight it.
The fans have wanted it.
Let's offer it to them."
Lomachenko's agreement.
"The world needs this fight."
The climate raised the question of whether this should be a matter of duty. It is part of his strategy that he wants Lomachenkol to debabilize 61.2 kg by the end of this year in order to make it possible to meet with Garcia (37-0.30 knots), who is equally interested in combating the fight against Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbell machine after their high-ranking event on 23 September.
"The view of the struggle could be valid because the fans have wanted this resistance," said Garcia, later saying that he is open to the fight on any channel that offers the best money package.
"We are fundamentalists.
No other name can pay such much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said he'd have to call Lomachenko "a strong fighter" and he could go see his lunch match.
But Lomachenko was back when Garcia thanked him, saying that he thought he saw three of Riverside's bosses out of "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted it out of your mind."
In Garcia's words, the aim was to show flexibility and then kiss.
Both confirmed that they knew how hard it was to get along with each other.
"This is a struggle that awaits realisation.
None of the other things are so much attention and attention.
I'm more than ready to work on that name," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is right.
It's gonna be a good fight."
From what world treasures are being moved to Estonia?
The police and border surveillance office (PPA) has extended its mandate to more than 13,000 third-country nationals who have officially travelled to Estonia to work, study or family.
If, for example, it was decided to issue a permanent residence permit to foreign countries 6702, that number was 4928.
Officials cannot say how many immigrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia, but such an analysis will be made by the Ministry of the Interior.
Ten years ago, about 500 Ukrainians returned to Estonia in the year, and in the last few years, that number will be approaching 2000.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased dramatically during the crisis in Ukraine - in 2014 it was reached by 1087 people, 675 years ago.
According to the Statistics Office, the largest number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia is now reaching 850 Ukrainian citizens more than ever.
"The Ukrainian community has been large in Estonia all the time, and because of the difficulties in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where society and many families are already in front of the family," said Prime Minister President Kristin Rammus.
The number of Ukrainian citizens who received a permanent residence permit was even higher than the number of citizens of Russia, although over the last ten years the most permanent residence permit has been the most recent.
When Ukrainians come to work here officially, the citizens of Russia are after their family.
"In view of this historical Russian community, they are likely to have the largest family ties with people living in Russia," said the Helsinki Maasing National Refugee Academy.
"If you see where the citizens of Estonia have moved to live after Harjuma, there is an East-Virumaa immediately after Harjuma," he added, adding that about 40 percent of them have married an EU citizen.
I remember having a permanent residence permit in 1696 as a citizen of Russia, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians wishing to extend residence permits decreased significantly.
"It is good that instead of extending the residence permit, new residence permit has been applied for permanent residence in Estonia," explained the press spokesman Rammus of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the years that have been opposed to Estonian residence permits has been more stable.
For the permanent residence of a new residence permit in Estonia, foreign nationals who have lived here for at least three years may apply for a previous year.
This objective is to encourage appropriate people to stay here.
For example, a long-term residence permit is expected to last for five years.
After the new residence permit, it is likely that the extension of the old residence permit has also been reduced.
For example, a residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years.
The Ukrainians are now able to exchange jobs and the Estonian State is no longer closely following whether the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit became more popular - as applicants, the owners of the hall passport (1029), the Russians (487), the Indians (54) and the Nigerians (36).
For the purpose of living in Estonia, there were a number of people living in 1968, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians, and many Chinese.
With the first half of the year, the total number of such applicants has already been 1269.
For ten years, the country has received from Nigeria, whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When the Nigerians were granted three residence permits in 2007, they remembered 200.
From Nigeria we're going to study at these universities.
Estonia's high schools are still popular, for example, in Georgian, Chinese and Turkish.
The number of citizens in India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased considerably thanks to the students.
They also apply the rule that where a community has been established, it will be easier to go to others," in the Annex to Rammus.
For ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, as well as many from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
When about 6,000 third-country nationals are granted a residence permit per year, it is approximately 0.46 percent of the total population.
Even if we think of the citizens of the European Union, they will remain close to about a percentage," Maasing commented that there are actually few.
A total of 14,822 people were deported to Estonia by the Statistics Office, but 13,792 were expelled.
This means your sister's been away for two years.
Most of the graduates are Estonian citizens, but most of them are refugees.
As a result, the foreign population of Estonia had a low income of 2000 people.
In particular, the Estonians are fleeing between Finland and Estonia.
Mamma Couture's princesses owe it to satisfactory, tetanus and fat
However, for Maria Tammeor there is a history - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream of the goods for hours in a museum and admire the old clothes and crates.
If you do something with your book, you'll study it and learn about it every day.
It's an invention!
The glamorous world of Couture's mother can show some life-cycles, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide for yourself how much interest you have in your life!
I've got a friend who's got a whole pool full of my created funeral costume clothes.
Because it's not his fault that he doesn't live in Hollywood and he doesn't go to a red ball every day, he wants to wear these most beautiful clothes and wear them!
You can live your own life in a special way!
The artist does not recognise the gap between the events of the scene and the day of the hall.
That is exactly what led to the plan to bring up high tides in Estonia between the landscapes, the forests and the fields, to people whose way is often not possible.
For example, Mother’s collection was presented on the Moeall of Võrus, South and Pärnu, where with 45 models royal defelicate filled a whole day.
In Tallinn, it's often taken in, it's pushed into the back, but there's more emotions - it's a braavo, it's rising up, it's going to thank you.
Most of the audience came to such an end, but now they're Mommu Couture's fans.
If you're beyond the expectations of people, they're inspired!
And I like it feeling like I'm on my moo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-
We had a 50-foot red coat, full of beautiful today's clothes full, it seemed they wouldn't come to an end!
Maria also does not admit that the creature has to present a supermodel to the supermodel, and she brings normal women to the bathroom with pleasure.
I often invite my own customers to the bathroom - they've always come with joy.
It's such a nice experience, you can wake up in a quiet dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my own appearance, I've always been behind the table to give up hope for perfectionist things.
My nerve wouldn't allow me to look quietly at the door.
Mary is this sort of moolo who doesn't just want to fulfill the role of representation, but it's all in hand.
I've got a studio on my ammo, most of the collection I do myself.
I like the whole process you're playing with details, you know.
I'm never far from my creation and I'm not afraid of work.
There is no limit to the design of the matter, including stylists, logistics, organization, organization - everything has to be done by a woman's day of one temperature.
It's not like these feelings of work are going to happen to fanatics.
I can't say when my workday ends, it's just a day full of joy for me!
I've still had a lot of fun - it's like an endless time of happiness: I'm doing something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and yet a compliment.
Many times I've been told there's magic in my clothes - they make themselves a princess.
The lovely blue satiries that Maria had made during the past hour of the talent have remained a signature by Mama Couture to this day.
Martin Mürsep from the U18 boys: A gun from the Estonians was now turned against us
I'm sorry. The old man got away.
First of all, it was obvious that we couldn't get our table.
And when the table is going to be so big, there's nothing to do," commented Estonian U18 Cornballs 61:75 down to the UK our only NBA played Corvballer, BC Kalev/Cramo abitrainer Martin Mürsep.
The response took 28 pals from the attack and received so much more attacks.
We were also not prepared for their aggressive protection or attack, it broke.
Many English attacks ended with three to five seconds, and we couldn't build up our protection.
But they were able to keep their hands between them, and we couldn't combine.
It fell on the team's feet.
The response's work was better done.
On the basis of the Mürsep assessment, Estonia had to make more tactical failure to take them down.
Last Friday we had zero mistakes, but the opponents have already got a lot of quick pay.
Athleticity and a sharp move which was our weapon at the subgroup tournament, now all turned against us.
Today we did not have the power to resist their aggression.
Mürsep left his care for Kalevis, Mattias Tass.
In general, tournaments are able to speak the good news about the whole team, which has been at the same level today.
I'm sorry you've already met with such an aggressive opponent.
Tass has been on his own all the time and played out today, but he seems to have been tired - he's been carrying quite a load.
But he did some great movement I've seen in the trains before," the guide added.
Bad numbers: At the end of the series, the EM tournament ran through three rows with less than 10 points...
The U18 age class does not only run the EMI B-division Corps tournament in Tallinn, they started over in Dublin.
And the Estonian game with Poland was a little bit better in the field of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter there was only 9:49, i.e. only in the last ten minutes, took the corresponding feet from the gas pedal, and the production period remained at 16:16.
On both the first and the second Friday, Eesti's 4rd point 1...
At this point, the Estonians started with two minutes from the first two pieces of whiskey, but then from the game 25 pieces, then one third into and then 21 more moves through...
Maybe in almost half an hour, one of 47 whiskeys was killed.
In addition, point 2 came from the four freeway.
The pallet was a reasonable number at this time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland was 33 per cent (68/9).
Estonia has begun with two losses, on the open day it was announced that Portugal was better than 83:56.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to add equipment
Today, NATO has reached a permanent minima group 1 for a weekly exchange in Tallinn for a planned port visit to supplement the ship's equipment and prepare for future exercises.
During the voyage, ships make preparations to return to the sea and provide crew members with an opportunity to rest for a couple of days.
After the visit, NATO ships will sail into the waters of Estonia to carry out a number of exercises and be ready for future search for historical explosives.
"The participation of Estonians in NATO units and in local waters of cooperation will well reflect our integration with the Union forces," said Captain Arto Reinmaa of the Overseas Operation and Planning Division of the Navy.
Since June 29th, NATO has led the Latvian seagoing Captain Gvido Laudups, who took over the task of organizing the ceremony in Rijas, which took place over the Estonian Navy Commander General Johan-Elias Seljam.
The group’s flagship is defined as the Latvian seaport ship LVNS Virsaiti, which is also operating at the group’s lead stage.
This half-year includes the composition of the international unit of the Estonian seamine leader Sakala.
One of the four groups of ships under NATO maritime public administration is a permanent NATO 1 mini-mixture unit, one of the first high-speed reactors to which the alliance may be sent to different parts of the world within five days.
4. - 13. In August, the memory of the Pirita monastery will be restored to its place 13 years ago by the Maestro Eri Class, called the Birgitta Festival.
Today's Birgitta Festival, Tallinn Philharmony's artistic leader, Risto Joost (36) says to be beautiful, powerful and unpredictable.
Risto Joost: My listeners come to the opera world classes "Traviata" and "Tosca", the ballet answers from "Balleros" at the "Karlssonini" game, and there is no planned production of their own, which is at this time the same international creation team as Joseph Haydni's "Years" in 2015 who brought the Prirital valley to Haydn's second master's "Lood".
Birgitta Festival is more than just concerts and theatre responses.
It's bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
It's a festival whose joy takes power and never let go of it again.
Because the experience gained by the listener in this upper and secret environment makes the impressions come true, and it does not concern people in a way that is impossible to describe.
Cristo, you've been an artistic leader in the first year of Birgitta Festival.
Didn't the Maestro Eri Class look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Class, there has been a lot of help from that.
He took me through my entire course and supported me at the beginning of the course.
Maybe just thanks to that, I'm gonna have to keep her job.
The different class has been injecting the Birgitta Festival team so much good and of course it's all over me too.
It was great to join a team who knew exactly how things were going.
Just the great heart of Eri Class also gave me the power to go on with Tallinn Philharmonic in Birgitta Festival.
And here I am and I can go!
What could make a public at a festival that is special to offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and as a surprise, we will be presented in the museum with the first ballet written in Astrid Lindgren's story.
That's why Karlsson's flying.
And one of the sad things about it is that the author of this ballet is Latvian hero Juris Karlsons, who published himself to write about this work.
Apparently, she's already had a child alive in Karlsson's character.
Cristo, how are you all of this?
Thank you very much for my support.
Such work requires support and much love, and I'm happy to have it.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions don't depend on so many other people as much as I do on myself, maybe I'm going against every new day.
And such a conscious tone of mind, keeping positive and actually smiling at yourself in the morning, significantly increased my happiness.
Especially now that this week, when there is the most important evidence, I have practiced it in particular, and it works.
Laughing further activates the brain and increases the performance.
It's not just a word.
I think that people don't know half of what the universe offers them yet, but everyone finds out about it.
Right now, it's an important moment in your hand.
Do you have any ritual before you hit the steering wheel?
Still, clothes have to be exchanged against the most comfortable ones.
It's this little moment for yourself.
But generally yes, I don't have a chance to clean up before the big show or make a little noise.
In fact, I even like to have an active relationship with people, even before the start of the steering wheel.
But come to the Birgitta Festival, here's what's to discover not only a very big opera and a ballet friend!
Look at my favorite videos with Risto Joost!
New results of the assessment of the age of asylum seekers in Sweden were published
A test was carried out in Sweden by asylum seekers, which evaluated their age with a new medical approach. The latest results show that more than 80 percent of the tests were evaluated older than 18 but not all of them did not believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Court of Justice (Jättsmedical Network) initiated tests at the beginning of this year.
Tests were created to assess the age of the asylum application after the Swedish Migration Network was criticised for having failed to properly determine the age of several alleged sub-Saharan refugees.
Currently, the migration network has been tested in 6880 cases and the Court of Justice has published a total of 2481 test results between mid-March 2017 and 31 July 2017.
Twenty-eight percent (2002) was assessed as 18 years old or older and for 25 more cases, the Court of Justice has assessed that the test “may be 18 years old or older”.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person is "probably younger than 18".
Tests shall only be used if the person's age is below the question mark.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Justice, the results are consistent with the previous six properties.
"We don't see the difference between the previous six statistics, the numbers are quite consistent," he said in The Local newspaper.
The fact that most cases were considered older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute issued the results of a May 581 test and said that in the case of 442 "they referred to the person under 18 years of age or older".
But when journalist Svenska Dagbladet examined their 581 test results, it became clear that in 243 cases, a person directly claimed to be 18.
This method of medical age assessment, which is carried out by the smartest X-rays and by the MRTs, which are then allowed to be analysed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some circles.
One of the scepticities of the Karolinska Institute is endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose tasks include the assessment of people's biological density to clarify whether they passed the usual puberty earlier or later.
"I have had reason to think about it and I don't think that the measurement method currently used should be used.
The definition of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't make a face to get," he told the reporter Metro.
But Johan Göransson of the Court of Justice has protected the accuracy of the tests: "It can generally be said that the risk of an abortion of a child is low.
The largest, perhaps about 10%, is at risk if a person is under 18. "

20-year-old left-wing Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut in London MMil, bringing 67.37 to the 18th place.
Orel was a young woman of MMI, and a happy woman confirmed that she was looking forward to fighting medals in the future.
The fight went well and I got a good experience.
With the first test (64.80), I immediately took my average result, and the second (62.80) was too much risk and the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," Orel said after the competition.
I've been looking for my shoes, and I'm very glad I found it.
Give Maria Oreli MMI's debout at the end of the 18th floor.
It's not too late for Orel because he's going to train through the TTU station.
"I'm tired," he said with a little more.
The London Olympics were almost full of people, did Orel recognize people around him or was he able to throw himself out?
I realized, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says it'll give you that.
If you fight yourself, you can try it.
Orel confirmed that MMI will remain at peace with the Debt and is still awaiting many good competitions: "I came here with the last result of the 32nd anniversary, I ended at 18.
It's a very good result.
I'm 20 years old and MMil is the only one that reads.
I'm taking a good experience and I want to fight on behalf of the medals in a few days.
Western Virgin Kuberner reported on party movements
On Thursday evening, Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia announced with President Trump that he would exchange parties.
"I like it or not, but the Democrats walked away from me," said the Governor Justice.
"Here I am telling you, having prayed fervently and then thought... today I tell you, Western Virgins, I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
At the time of the gathering, the audience was delighted.
"That's why I'm going to become a state-of-the-art," added Justice.
"Trenner, I'd like to tell you that it's time to play another game."
Trump had already promised a great deal of information when he gathered in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia with point 42 and Justice did not support democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only country in Forbes data is billionaire, the institution was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns five countries of stone carvings and that the stone miner almost left him his father.
His value is about $159 billion.
At the same time, the National Committee of the Liberals (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that "the transfer of the Cuban Justice party is a series of cuts to the democratic party which would prevent the country from being better transformed than working on its behalf".
"A total of 15 cyberspaces and control of the lowest number of countries over history - the news of the cyberjustice is simply the latest communication to the party that is headed from the end to the end and cannot find a positive and connecting message," RNC spokesman Ronna McDaniel told CBS News.
No wonder there are so many people there, too many wounded.
Ummet, who was in the medical office last night, said that the posters had to share a lot.
The villas and bars are basic, except for thefts and simple falls.
Of course, headaches, headaches and headaches.
As a result, visitors will come to the festival with false demands and thus problems.
Women have also had to help some of the most vulnerable visitors - there have been some panic attacks and one leg fracture.
We've also done ammos when a man's hand or his arm has made a hole.
We're going to make smaller cuts here, we're gonna get bigger to the hospital.

Coe thanked the Russian fair pardon for the doping channel
Sebastian Coe, an international name for the army, thanked him for his words after the Doping Canal of the Four-day Truth, but once again, that it is not time for national sport to be allowed back.
At the IAAF Congress in the pre-eminent World War I Congress of the IAAF, Mr Shylakht, the Russian Slight Forces, Dmitry Shylakhtin said that his country was right and that he had a firm goal of combating the doping.
He apologized to "all the light-powered steels whose hands have been pulled off in the competitions for gold and silver."
In spite of his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the entry into force of the competitive framework established in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found cases of a State-supported doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very good answer today, very nice presentation," said IAAF President Coe to journalists.
"The Council and the entire Congress were pleased that Russia has also acknowledged itself that they have had quite a difficult time and they are doing everything possible to reorganise the alliance."
In addition, Coe said he was pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its prevention.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and a progress is taking place, but Congress supports the Working Group's proposal that now is not the right time to return to Russia," said Coe.
"We have to do everything possible within the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always come from the principle that we want to separate the pure sportsmen from the corrupt system," he added.
Eight Russian lighthouses meeting the strong criteria of the IAAF are competing on the lines of the start of the world’s power race in London as neutral sportsmen.
The IAAF working group leader Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia does not meet a number of prevention criteria.
Following a proposal to the IAAF Council, he told the Journalists in London that the doping control is still insufficient and that trainers who have been banned are still free to operate.
The revolution of electric vehicles significantly changes the requirements of metals.
Who are the winners and the losers?
A little since the revolution of electricity cars significantly changes all fuel markets to infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although mining giants like Glencore can say that they win and lose from one place to the other, smaller mining companies do not help.
Glencore is currently serving as a stone and oil, but in time electricity is growing cobalt, lithium, left, aluminium and nickel requirements.
This year, the United Kingdom, France and the Government of Norway have increased their contributions to the spread of electricity cars, which have allowed for nearly ten decades to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels.
The site has already known Volvo that they are planning to release from the internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring to the market Model 3 electric car.
According to the Bloomberg New Energy Finance projections, electricity cars will already be sold for two decades more than cars using oil-producing fuels.
"It's all about some metals," said Capital Economics to Simona Gambranin Bloomberg.
We have already seen a great impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, whose demand has grown for years.
In electric cars there are about three times more heavy than usual, Glencore reported.
There is an even more severe need in charging stations, so the exane BNP Paribas price will increase by around five percent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric vehicles means an additional alloy, cobalt, graphite and manganese requirement.
Glencore will be able to gain from the trend of growing electricity cars at the left value and from being the world's largest co-operator, predicted by the Jefferies Group.
This power plant is estimated to be another winner of the power race for Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
Today, 70 percent of London's metal bars have fallen from cobalt.
The value of the mill was 37 percent.
The growth has also increased by 14 percent, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's share increased by 20 per cent in London, with a significant increase in the Rivale Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billton and Anglo America.
On the part of the losses, companies such as Recyclex and Campine have to adapt to a new era.
The main end-use of the plate is the gas and diesel engines which start-up vehicles with a flow of batteries.
Electric cars use lithium circuits.
"This is a serious risk to steel demand, except if there is another intention to overcome the decline in demand," said Bank of America Merrill Lynchi, a metal analyser, Michael Widmer.
In the face of too much price fluctuation, there is still no indication of the impact of the irradiated trend.
Ply has cost 17 per cent of the steel industry in London, where it is the most priceable metal in the main industrial metals.
Investors see problems with metal only in the distant future.
"I'm not sure it's so bad on the plate because light oil keeps ordinary cars in competition," said Herwig Schmidt, the sales manager of Triland Metals.
When the demand for a ball is down, it'll take place slowly.
It may have happened about ten years ago.
Since then, however, the strictest emission standards for the increase in the demand for hybrid products which depend on the often developed lead-based acids at the start of motors has been assessed by the international research organisation for lead and lead.
Stainless metal such as aluminium replaces steel, as easier car can be driven by less electricity.
This is explained by an additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium demand by the year 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7% of the world's total production of aluminium.
This trend is probably getting worse, Widmer said.
Aluminium has increased by 13 per cent today, as a growing demand for car manufacturers has led to market deficit.
Terase producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding works with General Motor to use nanotechnology for the production of smart cars.
Also, ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are trying to develop a more flexible steel to resist aluminium.
"There should be a positive response to this development," said the analyst Sylvain Brunet, Exane BNP Paribas.
There are some benefits in Europe.
The end of the oil year may also bring suffering to the platinum.
I remember spending about half of this red-metallic diesel engine as car catalysts, reported metal refinery Johnson Matthew.
"Many of today's demand for raw materials such as oil and platinum will not in the future have a great demand," said Natix's raw materials analyst Bernard Dahdah.
This does not mean that raw materials become less important as a whole, but their importance changes within 15 years.
Platinum producers believe that continued demand for diesel hybrids.
Uncore's leader Marc Grynberg said that more hybrid cars would continue to be sold in 2025 than complete electric cars.
The high expectations of platinum producers in the 10-year perspective are toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos based on water-based vehicles that depend on the platinum to produce water-efficient electricity.
However, this technology has not yet been commercially justified.
"It looks like there's a clear loser on the road to power cars," said Exane BNP from Paris.
The German car manufacturers became part of a large reconnaissance party in July, as the Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in Mercedes-Benzi and Porsche.
How the Financial Rules of football affect the passage of Neymar to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unplanned use of European football clubs do not prevent the world record transfer of Neymar from Spain's football club to the Paris-Saint Germain Club of Barcelona France.
Whatever the consequences of UEFA, the governing body which controls the European game and which has the power to ban the participation of teams in the prestigious Masters' Championships tournament, Paris Saint-Germain is only waiting.
The financial rules of the game (FFP) established in 2011 in UEFA mean that the PSG must at any time prove that Neymar’s transition has been financed without damage.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million (262 million) alone for the purchase of its contract by the Brazilians, and Neymar's wage is going to grow to ten million dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of moving to the Neymar France club.
The PSG has no doubt been able to recruit Neymar and add such money to its major venture, taking into account that the team is funded by a family that manages the Katari energy race.
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on recruiting players, but they must balance them with legal income sources that enable them to get out of the football field.
The FFP was founded after Michel Platini was elected UEFA President in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs who are successful in seeking out large debts actually act with fraud and risking failure when banks or owners should quit supporting them.
Since 2011, FFP’s debt is focused on monitoring these losses instead of the debt of the FFP clubs.
This amendment means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich in 2003 - buying a potential club with Chelsea - and then making large expenditures to make the team better and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year evaluation period, which will last until 2018, the clubs may suffer losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the shame that Platin had been removed from the presidential office in 2015, his successor, Alexander Ceferin, has remained committed to preventing excessive consumption.
"The FFP has certainly not died and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen their rules," said The Associated Pressle Andrea Traverso, who is an UEFA FFP supervisor last week.
Although the PSG paid for the Neymar transfer clause as a whole, it is possible for them to distribute this amount for the purpose of bookkeeping as part of the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar concluded a five-year contract, so it is possible to show the amount of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
For the first loan of the FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG and Abu Dabel received the most severe penalties for the murder of Manchester City.
The PSG was awarded EUR 60 million (now $82 million) of a fine which was reduced to EUR 20 million at the latest, and the club called for the limitation of the Masters' Over Team in the period 2014-2015 of 21 players instead of normal 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to design regulatory financial institutions by talking about their incomes over the club's owners.
The Catarina company may sponsor PSGs, but if the value of sponsorship is considered to be above the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be taken into account as an official income.
In 2014, UEFA decided that the value of support for Qatar Tourism Authority PSG was exceeded.
It has been said that a certain part of the Neymar PSG service may come through payments from Qatar by the World Trade Organization Committee in 2022.
But PSG and Katar 2022 are promoting that Neymar could be sent to the world headquarters and claim that UEFA regulatory authorities could easily reveal such a manual.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more prudent in relation to any attempt to rule out the rules.
People who are aware of the situation said on Thursday that UEFA has not discussed the transition with the PSG Neymar.
They spoke with The Associated Press under the condition that they will ensure their anonymity because they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that during the IPG period 2015-2016 more than EUR 10 million benefited from around EUR 542.4 million.
The last financial year has not yet been published.
The PSG expects Neymar to have a good impact on sponsorship transactions, trade and wholesale sales.
The club is expected to increase by at least 30 per cent as regards the conclusion of the contract.
Over Spain, having clearly been disturbed by the departure of one of the biggest football players, Neymar tried to prevent the transition, claiming that PSG is breaking the FFP.
"This is a clear "financial doping" case with the club and the country," said La Liga President Javier Tebas of Spain in AS, referring to the fact that the PSG is primarily part of Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who owns a club belonging to the American sports industry, shares La Liga's concern that the country is funding the club.
"It has been behind property rights and it has completely changed the entire football industry in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of the game because the country may have other ways or interests to represent the country of such a great player."
Norway’s airline company has a good tradition of putting on its flight destination pictures of those who have crossed the border in their area and have been inspired by others, writes trip.ee
With the expansion of Norway’s operational geography, it has also expanded the circle of people who have served on aircraft.
For example, there are Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (on the map) and Miguel de Cervantes.

Today 50 years ago: the Orcanian storm in Estonia, which had swept away roofs and windows from the houses.
The storm of the century, which occurred on 6 and 7 August, caused great damage, especially to Western, Harjuma and Raplama.
In Estonia there was a wind speed of more than 30 m/s during those days.
My old man ran around the corner with one carded tree next to another and tried to support them with his hands.
Everything was dark and rough, like a world lesson.
In 2002, elderly Professor Linda Kurova Haapsallus mentioned an interview given by Estonian Nature.
Linda's husband saw how his seating room was packed.
But what do you still support with your wooden hands where you can resist such a storm?
The sea came down from the window and drew water into the water," said the Haapsallus Kalda, who lived in the town of Linda.
The fact that the roads were full of wood and the deck of the railway station had been flying 20-30 metres away, Linda saw most of her toothpaste just the next morning.
In the local saying, the trees behind Paralepa were planted in the fertile land, some completely long, some side by side.
Everything seemed very embarrassing, the storm started out of beautiful old trees and with a beach like a war.
In August 1967, the West-Viruma was not able to suffer very severely compared to West-Eesti, but the damage was even greater, wrote the Virumaa notifier in 2007.
The Haapsalu Losipark and Padise Park were sanctified by the property, but also our and our parks were able to endure.
In Tallinn the wind was measured at speeds up to 35 meters per second, about 130 kilometers per hour.
At Tallinn Meriv on the night of 6 August, there was a small platyprite saying, "Mom, Mom!
Canada is in the air and no longer gets under it," wrote the virumaa notifier.
During the storm, a small building in the farm was destroyed so that it was decided to collapse later.
The Augusttorm was no longer opposed to the construction of the Turkish pipeline which was no longer restored.
On 12 August 1967, the newspaper Red Star wrote that cleaning cities and the reason for the decline in waste and their crops is gradually advancing, and residents could be included in the work of recycling.
Farms were also severely tortured in Tormis, and the newspaper reported that "participating organisations must be both in the work and in the work of the harvest as a booster and as a guide".
Orcans may be spoken if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
On 2 November 1969, the record of the civil war in Estonia was maintained when Ruhnul was measured at 48 m/s.
On the island of Vyndloo was driven by a meter, so it was not possible to record the speed of the measured wind.
The secret of the pure soap gardens: night work and heavy coastal world
The sweetest ones also mean smaller uses in Tallinn's subspecies.
"If there is no, then there are people on the beach, and if there is no, there are no people," says the sun healer.
North-Tallinna Stream beach is smoking.
They offer melodic competitions on low turns of tractors, which descends to the beach.
In fact, the last seven centimetres go deep through it, removing seaphage and people's abandoned rice: bottlenecks, cigarettes, and other.
People still come from the coast, whether the water is fresh or not.
If there is a beautiful appearance, then there are people on the beach, and if there is no, there are no people," says Alexander Usov, president of the Haaberst Administration of the Coast Corps.
The clock is 6.30 and the sun's on the beach is running a hard work because at 8:00 a.m. there must be room for people.
Faith is already at work at 4:00.
In addition to the stream, he keeps his eye on Pirate, Harku Sea, Kakumäe and Paljasaare Pickari.
The number of cases has decreased.
Years ago it was a lot more.
People are now able to appreciate what they are doing for them," says Usov, who has been breastfeeding for 15 years.
It was so early that when something new got started, it was already over the next day.
Now we're keeping what's on the beach.
Net foreign value
One of the greatest works in Estonia's borders is the threat of seagoing fishing.
For example, on the east coast of Pirate, it must be transported to the coastal area of 400 000 tonnes.
"It's an incredible amount," says Usov.
The second major category is probably all that people leave behind.
In a half-kilometre, there are eight large prygic containers needed to be emptied three times a week.
There's so much dust.
However, the cold winters have meant that the spring is less than the fifth.
The third type consists of waste items.
Most of them are children.
This time, Usov's fleet has been able to take out ten fleet models.
They'll be able to wait for the next five frames of the coast.
"It's usually more coming out of them, but it's a normal thing." The belief already knows that he'll soon find them out again.
The children come to the beach and take toys to get them into the pool again.
The bridge is being pushed wide
Erika Scholler, the representative of the Haaberste administrative services, wishes that the tractor's crews are affected locally.
The wall, which lasts from hours to early hours, is surrounded by people living nearby and.
But it's impossible to do this work on a day.
In one month, the border must be crossed twice.
"If we don't do it, the city's gonna beat us," says Scholler.
But the goal is similar to that of Pirita, Pickari and Pärnu, also under the international brand of international bluefin tuna.
"There is much more work to be done in Estonia than Europe," says Scholler.
We've got more wood and stone and more hard to beat.
But Christmas is less expensive in our borders than elsewhere in Europe.
On hearing that the sun is spoken of as a storm, Martin, who lives in the vicinity of the Strom coast, will be presenting the current peaks of the sun with the discussion of the journalist and the crew.
There's a picture of clothing on every side of the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottle-bookers who have pushed prygic hooves," Martin reports.
Although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their old behavior patterns, Martin hopes that the city government will take some steps with pryxachettes and put them on board, for example, to prevent at least flights from being refurbished there.
In general, though, Martin is satisfied with the development of the River.
It's seen the city takes care of it.
It has become more enjoyable with children's outdoors, enlightened and freshly asphalted roads.
It's never been so long before the wheelchairs were able to drive just one way," says Martin.
Aerarchy found in Streams: coins, only coins
In the morning, the 40-year-old Dimitri has come to be used as a metal detector.
He doesn't think there's anything precious today or in the future.
The sea gods are not good enough for this.
"I've been doing it for years and haven't found anything valuable yet," Dmitri reports.
As Hobiaardic acid, Dmitri has some euro coins, bottles, and even dangerous jokes that will eventually disappear.
Usually there's still coins.
"It's not usually gold, rings and other strings," they say.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to be informed that interest rates will remain at an ongoing level because of the slowdown in economic growth and inflation.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth remains a threat, as incomes from rural areas have put an interest in waiting.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policymakers voted in favour of keeping the rates at 0,25%, and fewer members needed an increase this month, as slow growth has weakened strong growth.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank declined from 1.7% in 2017 to 1.6% in 2017 and from 2018 to 1.6% in 2018 and warned that stress will remain on the income of households as inflation is still expected to rise by 3%.
At the same time, the Bank also noted that the increase in the rates is necessary for the management of the inflation from Brexit over the next few years and the financial markets may need to be higher than the expected increase in loan costs.
Members also voted in favour of the withdrawal of a part-time maternity package which had been placed on the market following Brexit last year.
The Bank will end in February with a fixed-term financial scheme which provides funding to banks, although it said that it is now expected to have 15 billion laughs greater than the offer of 115 billion laughs.
In the Protocols to the Decision on the Limitation, the bank says: "The MPC average forecast remains a force for the future of the total domestic product (CFP) as the difficult situation of real income in the rural areas also continues to affect consumption."
In order to reduce inflation, it was clarified that it is necessary to "cut some of the funding policy to a certain extent" and to "more than a few times" to the extent that markets are expected.
Börs is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of the following year and the second increase in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any jumps are aesthetic and limited.
The decline in bank growth projections for this and the following year are equivalent to 1.9% in May and 1.7% in May.
The growth of 1.8 per cent in 2018 was maintained.
After that new year, the price rate for the dollar and the euro was reduced.
Nearly 0.5% of US dollars and 0.4% of EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make changes has been caused by recent fraud-producing growth indicators, which have combined growing expectations with rise in GDP growth in the second quarter of the previous three months, by 0.2% over 0.3%.
The Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is going to get slightly worse at the end of the year.
The latest bank’s inflation report gave rise in inflation and military wage for a few reasons to please the suffering communities, saying that the situation is getting worse before the improvement is even a little worse.
It was added that monetary policy could not prevent a drop in income in the next few years, but a significant recovery of wages is expected at the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the low noise, a growing demand for British production also stimulates the economy, which partially compensates for the lower consumer costs.
The decision shall take place one year after the reference rates were reached last August, after 0.25% of the EU’s shock reference, which has led to a sudden weakening of the laugh.
The bank price is likely to take four years to discuss prices and the economy in full.
Prior to the last bank decision, there was a growing demand for an increase in inflation due to increased stress in urban areas; in July three policy makers demanded an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell by 2.6% over the previous month, compared with 2.9% in June, although the bank's statement was optimistic and in the next months it is expected to rise again.
The Bank said that too much growth compared to the 2-percent target was due to a completely weak laugh.
Coreco, head of mortgage brokers Andrew Montlake, said: "In view of the recent decline in foreign exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming more competitive again, as lenders are beginning to work and hoping to end the year positively.
Börs seems to be particularly helpful to those whose current transactions are going to end, as refinancing, often services and low rates have become increasingly popular."
NHS has been reported to 10,000 people with HIV response
Since September, patients have access to the "transformative" anti-HIV treatment after the above-mentioned fight against whether NHS should be funded.
NHS England reported that national health is currently taking an initial three-year clinical trial estimated at 10,000 people to be available before exposure profile (PREP) - a tablet that is administered before the interval and which has shown a reduction in exposure to high-risk people by approximately 86%.
The NHS agreed to fund a clinical trial after the appeal court supported the decision of the Supreme Court of the previous year that NHS was able to pay for PrEP, despite the Authority’s own claim that the medicinal product should be financed by local governments.
NHS Acting Director Simon Stevens welcomed the "new broad intervention" on Thursday, while the National Aid Fund (NAT) described it as "a turning point".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. In October, clinics will be added before the programme is launched in April 2018 in England.
The pre-consumption profile (PREP) is a cycle of HIV medicinal products taken prior to the procedure to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV to pregnant people.
Taking PrEP prior to the interval means that there are enough medicines in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines may be taken every day or no later than two hours before the interval.
The treatment includes homosexual or bisexual men, transsoleous people and people whose partners have been infected with HIV or are not treated.
Patients identify suitable people who are willing to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transsocial people and those who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen to live there as a family will also be able to register their participation in the local sexual health clinic.
The programme pays 10 million yen and NHS England signed an agreement to obtain medicines this week after the international procurement procedure.
The objective of the clinical trial is to assess the actual potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of the intended medicinal product and how it is used and implemented in a large image.
Stevens said: "This new broad intervention should complement and enhance the broad and successful fight against HIV spread.
This is a series of contradictions over the three decades of human struggle with one of the greatest health problems."
Deborah Gold, NATO Activist, said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PREP, if it is intended correctly for those who need it and belong to a risk group, will provide an opportunity to modify the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people with high risk of HIV in England have access to a powerful new tool, which is individually managed or independent of negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We welcome this message from the heat."
Terrence Higginsi, director of the Ian Green Foundation, said: "It is now essential to ensure that the clinical trial across the country is rapidly under way and that no HIV risk group member will remain away.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial has been initiated, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of contracting HIV.
Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the preEP clinical trial has been very welcome and has been very late after six months of slowing down and slowing down the government's legs.
The evidence shows how much changes this medicine can lead to the elimination of HIV prevention and its life-threatening impact.
This clinical trial leads us to a closer understanding of the advantages of PrEP.
Now it is important that a clinical trial be taken over the country as soon as possible to protect people with HIV and bring us to a step towards halting the spread of HIV in society."
The electricity price rose by 12% in Estonia, but Latvia and Lithuania fell.
The Christmas reduced the difference between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania's price zones by EUR 1.94, compared with EUR 7.71 today in June, said Elering.
The main reason for the price difference is the richness of the Community of Lithuania-Russia.
In Estonia, the average electricity was at EUR 34,33 per hour last month and the price increased by 12 per cent compared to June.
Latvia and Lithuania dropped the price by five per cent from a megavatt-hour of EUR 36.27.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34,17 and the value of the North Pole system was EUR 26,37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices rose by 12 and 7 percent.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved 75 per cent in the previous month from Estonia to 16 per cent in Finland.
The remaining one per cent of transactions between the two countries did not take place on the following day.
The electricity flow between Estonia and Latvia increased by 99 per cent from Estonia to 73 per cent over hours.
According to transactions made on the last trading day of July in Nasdaq OMX market, in August the electricity can be converted into a gross power by approximately EUR 34 and by September 37 megavatt-hour.
The price of carbon dioxide for electricity production decreased last month and transactions amounted to EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
Living high - semi-currency and nudity designs have turned this small Earls Court court into a room home
Joanne Leigh, an old banker who is a church treasurer, changed his great Knightsbridge house in 2014 to the Earls Court court.
This is Queen Anne Terrace's first time and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bag together and sold the apartment further is an expression of respect for the new design.
"Before I lived it together with the former Knightsbridge living room on a much larger surface," said Joanne.
"I've been looking for something that would be equal to my offer price.
I was shown this in the Earls Court court and there were similar high-level boards.
I fell in love with it and I made the same offer the same day."
Since the first visit, this 93-route-meter card has passed a complete renewal course.
At first, it was one bedroom and a difficult setting to reach the floor - a bedroom floor. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half room to use high floors.
"I wanted high floors, large windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi Notting Hillis from the design and architecture studio Duck & Shed to use 3.8 m high buildings and create a house that would not be a mere development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The law was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a semi-final order to stand.
Erfan had to come to the matter naturally.
"The metal construction is pretty difficult," he explains.
"We had to reorganize the rooms so that they would be placed on each other's side without the need to worship.
It was not just building a platform, but we used steel construction so that the height of both upper and lower space would be right."
This regulation enabled Erfan to create two fully-fledged rooms in the room with a lot of dramatic elements.
Halfway opens from an old, solid-white retrouvius window to a glamorous living room.
With a gold frame, silver details and retrospective Serge Mouille's light-enforcement room style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatre, space and lightness.
In both parts of the short corridor, the mirrors have been added to make it look longer.
The kitchen leaves a window open in the back of the second room.
At the entrance, the view cap offers a seat for all Joanne's dining rooms and glass requirements.
The cost of closing the kitchen is added if it is not used by creating room for the image.
There's nothing new about the meeting rooms.
But there's a unique fact in this kitchen that doing is with the garage type of front door.
"There's been a bit of a projective," Erfan explains from the door of the MDF-spoked steel industry.
"There's a contradiction, so it goes very easily when it goes up."
Thanks to the use of the room and spare room, Joanne now has 16 extra meters, an additional bedroom and a better bed plan.
"At the end of the day, there's a piece of paper on what you sell--or what gives the asset its value," Erfan says.
"The cyclists arrive in the shape of the room and make calculations, supporting the surface of the floor."
Here they have been able to increase the floor floor using the quality materials that add room to safety.
"Material is what you're missing and which will help create emotional connection with this home," Erfan says.
"You don't love the electric fence on the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make our heart cry."
This shows that good design and an enlarged area will help you to do something quite surprising from the ordinary apartment.
In fact, these solutions can cause a desire not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
Chief Dane Jensen is a headlight in Chicago, which is fighting for an official offense with a colleague.
No more than the amount of money spent on which any kind of ethics is forgotten.
A man sees his wife and three children only in the early morning and late evening.
In the first half of the film I kill myself with the idea that this is a version of the "Kardimaja" business world - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler speaker is similar.
As the film goes on, however, it remains a less ambitious element and the moralistic intentions of filmmakers are becoming increasingly evident.
For life-threatening experience, the illness of the main son may be limited.
Now there must be a choice between work and family.
The son who sleeps at the architect's office on the walkway of his father makes Chicago's big buildings think about such important things as faith, goodness, love... without even having to face the disaster of two-storeys.
After the third stage where the father opens his eyes, he feels that filmmakers have come out of the public for sure because even the most hearty viewer can't hold back the tears of a dear little boy in the face of suffering.
When a son falls into a coma and his situation seems hopeless, a father can finally understand his work of morality and do good work to an elderly man seeking help.
Now I'm going to put myself in the picture - if the film is happy, then I'm premierting my transparency after the film's coffee, but if I'm wrong, then the scripter can at least thank you for one surprise.
For a moment, there's a doubt that no coffee is left - when your husband calls Dane from the hospital and a man knocks in the back of the corridor.
However, the son has been miraculously healed, and although his father has just lost his job, he also becomes positive because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can also get to know myself well - I can predict the end of America's drama quite well already!
In fact, the film has been well designed, all the elements needed for it exist.
You can laugh, you can laugh, the performances are good and moral beauty: money is not the most important thing in life.
This movie's going to get in.
The new staff member is planning to restrict the media use of the president.
The others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly's gonna be able to really start with it.
In that case, he'd be the first one.
Politico writes that the new White House staff plan to limit President Trump's power of information, including news, in the hope that it will maintain balance in water.
Here's a broken reporter Josh Dawseylt:
"When a new staff member of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with high officials on his first day of work, he brought out the issue of the removal of President Donald Trump Whites House, which he was planning to resolve in the hands of the President.
Kelly told the officials that information should be transferred through him, whether on paper or at meetings, because the President would make better decisions if he shared good information with him."
Kelly's diagnosis seems completely logical, but others have tried it, and they have been unable to encourage Trump by monitoring his media use.
President Trump's relationship with television has lasted for decades, and even now, when he is in the White House, his television viewing fees have not been lost anywhere.
"If the candidate Trump was in the wrong after a poor media coverage, he was obliged to show him that he was also treated honestly by the influential releases," former campaigner Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "the words of the six former campaign workers are to take control of Trump Twitter's attacks if it ensures that his personal media use also contains a stable thanks song".
All right.
But the idea that Trumpi Twitter use practices have ever been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know that the trumpeters would have been even more drunk without their intervention.
We'll probably never know about security that Trump didn't post.
If he was able to save her or several times from evil, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trumpy from developing a consistent leame.
Part of the problem lies in the fact that people in the White House trying to promote their own interests through the transfer of material that supports their world views but must not always be reliable.
In May of all nature, Politico wrote advice on how to feed the President with strategically-required information.
One example described by reporter Shane Goldmaker is as follows:
"The advantages and disadvantages of Trump say that Trump may respond to negative pressure, especially with harmful effects on information channels, explosively, taking into account their source explanation.
The same happened at the end of February when someone gave a copy of the website of the Internet procator Charles C. Johnson of GotNews.com, which accused personal assistant Katie Walshi of being a White House "a number of sources of information".
There's no difference that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of decommissioning or that he hasn't provided any specific cases or that he has also filed false accusations in the past and has taken them back.
Trump read the article and started to come up with Walshi."
Goldmaker added that the current staff member of Reince Priebus and the White House Chancellor Rob Porter "have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents coming from Trump".
How did this happen?
Kelly's trying to do exactly the same three months later.
Maybe he's becoming the most effective leader of Priebus, but Trump's still impressive and his aids are still fighting on behalf of the effect.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Foreigners who come from the capital shall not be allowed to be present at the fair.
In the center of Tallinn, many abroad go to music.
Those who got to talk to him at midnight testified that they were playing in the old city without permission from the city government.
For the first time, we found about three concerts of Viru’s rivals who had taken the same lot of dogs with us.
It was clear that musicians with raspascal and explosive clothing were cross - country skiings for which one shower was to be removed.
Despite the inconveniences, the only woman in the group played with the story of a rhythmful, while a man next to him was joggleled with three balls and invited the passers closer.
The third man was sitting next to them on one of their knees and burned his heart’s peace of mind ready to roll himself.
The three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the people passing by.
Bob, who played the orchestra with Noem and the ball players, told the audience that they were playing music for both fun and money.
The purpose of this event was to gather the flagship on a ship flying in Finland the same night of the same day.
When they asked if they were allowed to leave the city for music in the old city, Noem and Bob were kidnapped.
First of all, we didn't know.
Second, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or a few and usually be granted a leave for six or something.
There's no point in paying for it," Bob explained.
When we hit the Viru's guards about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women are at the music scene and they're going to leave.
The team was happy to meet the Viru Centre's cruiser with the ski lifts and dogs.
Today, three - and - a - half - year - olds who played violins, another clarinets, and the third had played an electronic piano.
"We are here to offer people pleasure to distribute music and joy and to earn money for fuel and living," explained trio pianist Mivosh.
In Mivoshi, they are aware that there must be permission from the municipal government to show up.
"Of course we don't have it," he said laughing.
But we hope that if people like our music, there's no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we'll go to the other side, but we'll have to try," he added.
Estonia Bank bought EUR 149 million in July under the euro area public sector reserve programme, and the central bank debt portfolio increased to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank shall not publish more detailed information on purchases.
Estonian bank President Hardo Hansson has previously explained in response to the panellists of members of the national parliament that the Eurosystem central banks reserve three different purchase programmes: covered bonds (covered bonds), secured bonds (ABS) and public sector debt (PSPP).
The central bank purchases a debt document from the market in order to encourage the investors who sold it to invest money elsewhere.
As a result of purchases, the production of low-risk assets is reduced and it motivates investors to take greater risks.
In general, in the framework of the public sector debt reporting programme, each central bank purchases its government debt notes, which are not purchased by other countries.
Since the State of Estonia has not issued a debt note, the Estonian Bank shall make the amount allocated to them within the limits of the rates of substitution.
Settlements shall also be made by central banks in countries where the provision of debt instruments corresponding to the purchase scheme is limited.
In general, the Estonian Bank purchases a debt document from the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Bank has been buying debt documents under the reserve programme since March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering’s debt document was also sold, but since June 2016 Eesti Bank no longer bought Elering’s debt paper.
In the name of the euro area central banks, from June both Elering and Estonia’s ENERGY bonds are purchased by the Finnish Central Bank.
The rounds separate the crane and return to the "Millions Region"
Some of the most powerful rural inhabitants of the West Midlands have once again been confronted by determined fugitives who have separated the stolen Krava from the authorities in order to win back from their villages.
The bikes have been parked outside their 20 haigasuvil to reach the "Millions Region" resurrected near Solihull today.
They have returned with the army of horses, children and vehicles after they just dropped out of the field, without letting themselves be confused with the Kraves that were seized by the authorities to prevent their entry.
The tactical group found a weak spot within the protective boundaries by punctuating their vehicles through the remaining parts that had been left standing.
The Maruvi people have visited the Solihull Authority, saying that the Authority is "used to deal with the problem".
One anonymous resident said: "They were there on the first night after their expulsion from Bentley Heath, where they ended up with the rocks.
The court must be ashamed that they are taking action because they have been used to deal with the problem.
The bikes were there in May, they walked away and now they're back.
They came to us last night, probably even more today."
He added: "The Burmingham Authority knows how to deal with such things by purchasing long-term barriers to the protection of its parks.
I live on the street Brooke, and I'm not satisfied that I have to continue paying for my office tax if the authorities can't even prevent such a thing."
One local resident who wanted to remain anonymous also said, "It's ridiculous. We just saw how the last of these fugitives left, and there's already a new outbreak.
This time, the number has grown and the number of horses has even come to mind."
The representative of the Solihull Authority said: "We are aware that Streetsbrooke is doing something near the country that is not allowed in the area, and we are working with the Solihull police. We are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
The collection of evidence is very helpful if as many local people as possible know anything about any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police, calling number 101.
This will help create a picture for the trial when we present it to them."
The weekend festival is also a visit to all others by the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, who is pleased that Estonia has been able to bring real world top names.
To the question why the Weekend festival is so important for Estonians, Saar answers that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the three-day event fully.
Köll, however, confirms that the real factors in his area have come to Pärnus.
"In view of the level of artists who have been able to bring to Estonia, to bring home the absolute top names of this musical genre - this is often not happening in our country," says the Minister of Culture.
What are the artists at the festival, but what is the most important thing about Sarat?
I think I'm relatively old and I'm probably one of the most experienced artist Armin van Buueren who took the lead last night.
According to his record rating, all of us at one time have also turned to their own feet," he says.
But Köll brings out several more names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our Estonian authors are also: starting from NOÄP and they can read the whole line.
In fact, this concentration of known names is very high," she says.
Look longer than the Night's Video!
The audit updates car manufacturers at the centre of the crisis of up to 850 000 diesel vehicles
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it offers more than 350 000 software to vehicles.
According to BMW, the company believes that "there are more obvious options than vehicle restrictions", referring to European cities, including the BMW national Munich, which has considered the prohibition or restriction of diesel vehicles.
On the other day, Daimler announced that it will update three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel engines.
No company described these operations as a refusal.
European car manufacturers have announced the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, carbon dioxide separated from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
In the same way, the cost of equipment installed to neutralise diesel-gas emissions for car manufacturers increases the cost of the equipment installed to neutralise diesel emissions, making it difficult to keep the price of vehicles competitive.
At the same time as Germany's car manufacturers are under investigation, Union cants Angela Merkel are also accused of calling powerful car manufacturers and of discontinuing signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen’s errors, which, however, undermine the use of counterfeiting devices that allowed the vehicle sample to be adjusted to conform to regulations during the test of exhaust gases.
Several of the Volkswagen leaders have been accused in the United States and the others have been under investigation by both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Last month, the former director of the thermodynamics sub-unit of the audit engine department was arrested in Germany.
Only President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be brought to trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, audits were brought into criminal investigation against Volkswagen, when the authorities charged the installation of the audit system to eliminate the requirements for European emissions by extending the approach that had previously focused on the United States.
The involvement of the audit in the investigation may be a large hope for Volkswagen to generate an disproportionate share of Volkswagen's use.
Estonian schools will be awarded EUR 20 000 for the European Union flag.
The Ministry of Education is planning to buy Estonian schools on 1 September to mark the European Union flag.
A total of 105x158 cm shall be obtained from the European Union's 570 educational institution.
The doors are designed to be exposed in indoor spaces, which must also be made in high-quality printing equipment in indoor spaces with sensor approval, the ERR news portal shall be interspersed.
The lipovarda page contains the text: "A commitment to Estonian schools to mark the first presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 lipsticks is EUR 20 000 at the cost of the Ministry of Education, or one lip will pay EUR 35.
The murder of a journalist highlights a growing danger situation in Mexico
The staff of Mr Riodace usually gather for three days to review plans for the most recent trial in the state of Sinaloa due to organized crime, corrupt officials and unconstitutional drug wars.
But today they've gathered to discuss their safety in the privacy of personal tragedy.
They're told that it's important to change their routine.
Two journalists discuss what seems to be a danger: whether to bring the children to the office with them, which was the target of the 2009 census, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words to the wanted man in front of the room: "the enemy", "the neutrals", "the allies".
They ask the reporter to provide the names of each column without needing evidence, enough of memory and inner sense.
In the case of government or cartels, drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of making a whole list of bad names that pose a threat to the recovery of the government of Mexico.
There is no peace of mind and the more deadly deaths across the country, the majority of which are journalists from the data of the Journalists' Protection Committee have since the resignation of President Enrique Pena Nieto in office in December 2012 at least 25.589 journalists have been killed after attacks and threats under national protection and have thus far been killed in at least seven countries during this year.
One of the most recent failures is their operator and inspirational source, Riodace co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on drug abuse.
His absence gives deep sense, although his location can be seen on all the Riodace hall façade depends on a large picture of the middle face of Valdez with the letter "Right" and two 30-day reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, support T-shirts that have been formed with his smiling face or his own personal pancake.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmares, sleep, paranoia.
Although a separate national court was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, only two cases were reported by the Journalists' Protection Committee.
Like most of the deaths associated with annual drug trafficking and organised crime, the number of deaths of journalists is increasing to thousands of years.
Riodace continues to reflect the violence that prevails in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is even more dangerous.
Without the data and justice of the killers, Ibarra’s meeting on security is of little benefit.
"It's very hot to waste your time here at the meeting," she says.
"until you know why, you're all in the mood."
Valdez left the country’s main office in Culiacan on the morning of 15 May.
She managed to drive only a few quarters before two men stopped her red Toyota Corolla. She was forced out of the car and shot 12 times.
The armed man drove to Valdez's car and made an accident near it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
A woman and two grown children disappeared from him.
The public will freely spread in Culiacan.
But Valdez's theme is basically just an act.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the release of the United States of America in January, Sinaloa has been one of the most bloodiest combatants in the country, as rival clicks fight after the power struggle is over.
There is no difference that Sinaloa’s people are left every day with a few people or divorces or that deaths come from some of the most beautiful two - fold dolls of the drug kingdom, which are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a moment that peace refers to when only one cartel leads a seagoing country with valuable ports and the United States of America.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was exposed to the dangers of his work, Riodace’s co-sponsor and president Ismail Bojorquez (60) felt guilty that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that killing was promoted by two errors.
The first of these was the publication of an interview with the children of Guzman and a folder that was competitive and wartime by the name of Damaso Lopez in February.
This paper could be annoyed by the suspect members who bought all copies of the issue as soon as they arrived in the press.
The other was that Valdez was not forced to leave his country on his own security after an incident in one of the same story unfolded in the press.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his execution is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he was always there.
In 2003, he worked as a veterinary reporter at Noroeste, when he joined five colleagues to create Riodace, selling 50-dollar parts.
Bojorquez said that in Sinaloa "it was impossible to deal with journalism without the problem of drugs".
The newspaper was filled with feelings of anxiety and honesty and increased sales and advertising.
The reporters liked to publish powerful research without fear of censorship and readers in the press, from which they could read stories that no one else had encouraged.
Eight years after Riodace was established, the newspaper won its prestigious Maria Moors Caboti award for Latin America's arguments.
In the same year the Valdez Journalists won the International Press Freedom Prize for International Freedom of Journalism in the Valdez Journalists' Committee (AKK) for their commitment to follow up on all the drugs in Mexico where it leads.
He admitted to being a card.
"I want to live on," he said, taking the AKK assessment.
Earlier in October he told TV broadcaster Rompevinto TV that drug trafficking is in Sinaloa’s way of life.
"You have to take up the task that comes with the newspaper office's second chance is to play crazy.
I don't want you to ask me what I did in front of so many dead people or why I didn't tell you what's going on."
riodoce's collective is one of Valdez's dancers, who played like Madrus, a friend who shared emboss and advice, a teacher who knew how to stay alive.
They supported his routine.
He always wore his glasses.
He went from office across the street to El Guayabo bar and sat on the same table.
Now they're asking if she's got her routine experience.
His death has also caused them to doubt how to do their best and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you drive their women, their children, their legal businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things didn't happen," said Bojorquez.
As a result, even in the best of times there are strong self-sustainment and self-sustainment.
Trusting your instincts.
If it's getting suspicious, keep away from it.
In the words of Riodace, director Andres Villallreal, there's a problem with "the winner can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that there are no older rules in Sinaloa, just as they are no longer applicable in Tamaulipas, Veracruzis, Guerreros or other countries, which are home to the brutal co-operation of law enforcement officials, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The Earth is constantly changing.
In the area where Riodace's workers were gathered for security training, mobile phones were no longer allowed; some days before this, it was revealed that only the money sold to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two police officers in front of the house were looking for relief from 40 degrees of heat.
The government appointed them to oversee the Riodace office, which is located in a four-story building in the Culiacan Middle East.
Some reporters wondered whether these police officers were among the 50 per cent of the police officers who had been abused by the governor himself.
A few months have passed since the reporters have been driving into the dark places where the control of de facto drug addicts is under control.
Riodoce discussed three main issues this week.
One of them was former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez's brother's murder in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had an evident story of the government spending money on the governor's household.
And one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan's office was kidnapped by a group of people from the prosecutor's office.
There was some official information about who was robbed or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knew about the restaurant was both a place for drug dealers and authorities.
The rapporteur was informed from public documents that the restaurant has been registered on behalf of a policy that belongs to the existing institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all policy reforms almost throughout the previous century.
In recent times, a number of cases have been accused by the IRP Governor of corruption in the context of the case-law.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about the previous incidents in the same place, including how our son, El Chapo, escaped from the army.
More than a few months ago, readers would have searched for Valdez's column to get information about the human race from the best source.
"We'd already know what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose body structure has served him under the name El Flaco.
"Now all the channels of communication have been broken with our sources."
Valdez's office has been given a storage room for chickens and rabbits protesting against the killing of journalists, and workers have been given something they have never been able to wait for activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few calls the following morning after a reporter to the local prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame died in the western part of Michigan three days after Valdez was killed.
It has been found to be burned dead and it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists throughout the country have become more vocal and critical of organized protests on the words and buildings of the phrase "SOS press".
On that day, President Bojorquez is absent in Washington, trying to gather international support for justice in Valdez.
On the day after Valdez died, Ramirez accused the press of breaking up and killing them of telling the truth.
After that, he asked that he be moved to reflect on the government’s activities, worrying that anger had affected his objectiveness.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists have organized crime, co-rapporteurs and "restricted" by any society.
In his last book "Drug Journalism" he wrote that not only did the reporters kill drug rights, but they also do so by means of political and security forces organized in the field of crime.
The Media Channels Supervisory Group Article 19 owned more than half of the press attacks on police and state officials last year.
"In Mexico you die because you want to be able to move," said Ramirez.
The four are obviously affected by blood clotting.
No one forgets blogger Maria Elizabeth Macis' death in the northern border country of Tamaulipas six years ago.
He was found here with a letter that he probably wrote under the Los Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my reports."
On the other side of his haired head, the computer keyboards and keyboards were released.
Some of the issues have decided to close their doors, for example, the newspaper El Norte in the northern border country of Chihuahuas following the killing of Miroslava Breachi in March.
The others will continue as did the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after their leader's murder in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke to the drug cartels in public with the guidebook "What do you want from us?".
Some journalists have paid from their home countries or even from their country.
It's an emergency decision.
It's hard to find jobs in exile and they still have to keep up with today's dangers to avoid.
And sometimes they are followed, as is likely the case with the photographer Ruben Espino who was killed with four women in one Mexican apartment three months after the Veracruz page.
Those who remain at work and continue to work must rescind the decisions of the risks each day.
Ibarra, who ever wanted to become a smoker, admits that taking drugs scares him.
"Mehiko is on his way to hell and that's why I'm going to report it," he said.
One of the latest circuits in the middle of which the latest number had already expired, Riodace's operators sat in front of the office on the road and stole oil as soon as they started to vibrate all phones.
In the coastal resort city of Mazatlan, there were 19 confirmed data from the recent exchanges between rival forces and security forces.
The war continued to scale, as did many of the cartels found in the region.
At the same time, the page reporters are making use of the new mobile phone on the Riodace website.
The next day, there was a need for a change.
The Sirenes were shocked to see a series of future exchanges in the region.
Bojorquez was hiding behind the police guards to see if they were guards.
If they were scared, they didn't show it at least.
The paper has fallen under the massive portrait of the founder, whose average face is seen throughout Sinaloa, the Riodace workers followed him.
"How could you think of closure at all," said Bojorquez, "on the same day that Javier was killed, asked the practitioner to send him a report?"
The dinosaur was used to protect its enemies
At first, it looks like a picture, even though it's pretty scary.
Scientists have recently published the first findings regarding the undisputed presence of an undisputed nitric acid in Canada, which has so well maintained that experts have described it as "Mona Addis Ababa."
This solution was so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the skin covered with its roots was the color of the red plume and its past was somewhat "circuit".
In the journal Current Biology, the report described the existence of "the best preserved of the somnolence market which has ever been found" and the "one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
Fossil has a new type of nutrient that lives in the middle of the crisis, 110-112 million years ago.
Impartially good storage of raw materials that describe it as "really significant".
The plant habitat covered by these plants is the best preserved in the National Geographic data on this type of fossil that has ever been found.
It was found on 21 March 2011 Shawn Funk when he was hunting Suncor Millenium in the mining fort McMurray near North Alberts Canada.
He lost something that didn't remember the surrounding stone, and decided to look closer.
The open fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Palontology Museum.
The following six years were worked to extract animals from 2500-nail (1100-kg) land.
After all this misery, the final outcome is finally ready for the public.
"If a little eyes are to kiss, you can almost believe he's asleep," said author Caleb Brown, a lecturer at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the existence is exposed.
"It's going to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - Mona Lisa."
In his skin studies, he found that this plant eater, who is indeed covered with mushrooms and remembers a moving tank, likely threatened significantly meat-food dinosaurs.
It used red and white protection colors with strong shades of lead to hide from the shells, and implemented a rescue technique called resistance and used by many animals today.
This enabled the experts to put the dinosaur in a better environment and to avoid enemies because the larger dinosaurs were likely to be driven by them.
This 110 million-year-old nodograss family first reached new land and is now being visited at the Royal Tyrrell Palontology Museum.
The trainers have now examined the existence and gave it the name Borealoppelta Mark Mitchell, the laboratory of the Museum of Mark Mitchell, who belonged to a team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to expose the animal as hard as possible.
Thanks to its own amazingly good preservation, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of animals.
They discovered a method of protection developed in the country of animal origin, which means that there was a darker side than the bottom.
Although resistance has been spread, it will come as a surprise that Borealopel has a mark greater than that of animals with resistance today.
This leads to the active pursuit of dinosaurs by other meat users in sufficient activity, in order to ensure that they are protected by life-threatening techniques.
But most of the animals that use today’s immune system - such as rats, zebras or bears - are much smaller and more vulnerable, which suggests that it must have been really difficult to survive.
"The powerful pursuit of the dinosaurium covered by large and strong pipes shows how dangerous it could be to be more stealthies from the crissian dinosa strains," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the veins also showed that the skin of the dinosaur was red.
Scientists continue to study animals in order to find guidance on their life, including the contents of their soybeans, to explain what animals are for their last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into a dead hole, reaching the lake with a flood, where he had to climb the ocean floor.
At that time Albert had the same soybean as now in South Florida and the oceans were probably far from home than now.
"This nodulus is really significant because it has been completely covered with Finnish skin, at the same time it has remained three-dimensional, keeping the animal's original image," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal appears to be almost the same as the critic today.
It doesn't have to use a lot of imagination to rebuild it - it's just going to blow your eyes and it looks like he's just sleeping."
It was the time of the crisis when the Earth brought on its two legs the moving dinosaurs of the meat eaters - theteropods.
Although all of these kings of Tyrenosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealoppel, they could hunt for some of his frightening ancestors.
Among these are Acrocanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 m) long and six tons of colet weighing.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealoppel was threatened by the sea after death and it was altered in mummification.
On 21 March 2011, Shawn Funk discovered his presence when he was digging for the Millennium at Fort McMurray near North Alberts Canada.
In the words of the museum, it has been best preserved in the hunting industry in the world, including leather and wool, and it is full of condoms until dawn.
These were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3000 nautical miles (1300 kg).
Two 20-tears of gold out of this hole.
Scientists believe that this plant food covered by the seeds would pass through the current West Canada until the threat of this aquarium was over.
However, the marine location of the dinosaur helped to keep its wishes in full detail.
The remains of this particular property have been so well preserved that the long-distance tops of the Hungarian dynosage still cover the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine: "The level of stability is as rare as the noise.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
Stirred skin caps are still used for breeding on three breeding grounds.
A better front will relax away from him and the way is sure to be moved up.
I've got the ability to read the wishes on her property."
How did one of the activists find the answer to the question "Who are they?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a full shock.
The next day after New York's journey, it sat in a room built by St. Louis residents of Airbnb, via Facebook.
He was on his way to his old college post.
There was a letter saying, "The police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he's released today."
He was confused about why no one else had posted this information on his campaign, so he shut down Facebook and open Twitter.
Pideme @TheePharoh user posts were repeatedly distributed in his journal.
From the region of St. Louis, a rapper was presenting Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who killed a white policeman in Ferguson Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's life from the body that freed him tonight, leaving him there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought himself.
But death was nothing new to him or to his community.
He put his phone off, but later that night he saw again the security that announced this time of the gathering of people at Canfield Drive.
He took photos of the police and the suffering of the people and the man who claimed to be the father of Brown and still kept the letter "The Ferguson Police killed my unarmed son!".
He was looking at a real fight where the police were standing in front of a group of protesters with dogs.
In the second video, another policeman beat him and shouted, "I'll kill you all... animals."
Ferrelli remembers how she lost her mind, "It's amazing."
"It's not the kind of murder we've been practicing and what we could call a typical murder."
I knew some scary Jews right now.
I was angry, and I woke up."
He saved his return flight and drove home the next day.
When he was 23 years old, he went to his father’s home for his six - year - old daughter and decided to drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson next three years is the central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Who are they today?"), which is featured in the film on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and commitment from those who live in this community and who meet the requirements today.
When Ferrell and his daughter - who had a colorful dress and head with it on the Kron - Ferguson side, they discussed again the subject they had discussed before this morning several times - about the experiences and living conditions of the blacks.
"Do you remember when I taught you how black society had to fight for their rights?" he recalls himself asking.
"We're driving now to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not true."
"I couldn't take her with me," said Ferrell later.
"What's going on right now is... a culmination in the past.
He needs to know it and see it and grow between it.
He must learn about activism and organization and also know the various aspects of black people's experiences and living conditions and what we need to do in order to be free and free from them.
Even if I succeed in raising him so that he doesn't personally experience racism, he doesn't differ from some other black girl.
I feel like I'd make him a punishment if I'd protect him from this world."
The first stop they did when they arrived in Ferguson was on the South Florissant road - from the police department across the street, which had received some kind of warehouse where activists were waiting for new police officer Darren Willson, who had not been charged at all.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined the local businessman who made the raw materials.
They brought together the pages of food and helped to share them with the protesters.
For Ferrelli, gradually began to take a new type of activism.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was the President of the Union of the Peace Schools and focused on food justice and health-related inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organizational experience.
It's all just leaves."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with his co-director Sabaah Folayan during the night's entertainment.
Folayan said that his and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farr wanted to document what was happening.
Ferrelli immediately asked: "Are you trying to document or find a story that can be used?"
Artificial scepticism was caused by a number of cases where people - mostly white people - are coming to society and trying to cut off its pain and resistance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We've heard that people born and raised in Ferguson can't hear the voice and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already broken his hands with his co-director, Damon Davis, an artist in the region who had been known for activism in connection with the prisoners who were sentenced to death.
His involvement changed the project to cover Ferrelli and six other locals for which film "Whose Streets" team after Brown's shooting years later.
"There's no one talking about us or us in this documentary, but we're talking about ourselves," said Davis.
"It was important for me how these people are portrayed, because I am. "
Although it was not intended to focus on Ferrelli's experience - it was shown that the movement did not stand "in the direction of the performer, but at the meeting of the community," as Folayan said, the most open part of his film was his.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" records outstanding personal aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as love and marriage to his wife.
"I felt like I was down there," said Ferrell, laughing for the first time when he was ready to see the city hall.
"But I realized that doing this work and the humanization of black people must be accompanied by some vulnerability."
More than that, Ferrelli's story emphasizes and rescinds the central role of a woman who is homosexual in the broader movement of the Black Lives Mater.
Two of the three starters of the movement, who were thinking about social media in 2012, after the death of the Black Rabbit Trayvon Martin, are homosexuals.
"In a leading role, black and white homosexual women have kept movement in general," said Ferrell, "and this is just because we have to keep fighting on several roads.
Black homosexual women must bear all this burden."
Folayan's agreement, noting that "the movement is truly preserved by black women and many of them are black homosexual women".
He also claims that "making is not a matter of creating any kind of equal opportunities" - Ferrelli has not chosen to be the centre of the film because of his identity.
"He was a man of the air of the right energy," he said.
"But it is not a coincidence that he was directly in the neighborhood because a black homosexual woman lives in such shelters in a lot of weight.
His energy is possible through the screen."
At the same time, news cameras have disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and the police are still acidic.
During Ferrelli's memorial service, the sentence shall last for another 2.5 years.
He describes the social policy atmosphere in the region he calls home, simply as a "crowd."
However, he still has to be an important mantra that he's been eating since he left for the sake of Ferguson three years ago.
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose from our families."
7 Tips How to Get Over After Weekend
Some of the tallest men find it after the toothbrush must be something that's going on, and that's what's gonna help.
Or they're going to say "the forest base, stay clean."
But it's just an inevitable move forward and a healthy balance.
What can you do to make yourself feel better and get as much money as possible after this and tomorrow weekend's track or others?
Yeah, yeah.
Drinking down and down after a big morning... or even a chance for alcohol.
Since the body loses alcohol when it needs a lot of water, it must be recovered somehow.
With water, mineral substances are also threatened from the body and the set of minerals are good to drink.
Since the stomach has often been upset after touching, it is especially good if the product is free of dust or simply gasped.
Go walk.
Of course, it would not be reasonable to go to the elders to shoot trees - this may prove to be a tragic lie.
But a simple walk will help your body to recall what it feels like to be alive.
In the sense of resting and excavating the foundation is a more urgent way to get well.
Give your body back your energy and carefully.
If you're going through the last crossing, you certainly don't have to try to load a big load.
Start, for example, from a fresh dish containing grape juice that does not seem to market your body.
If you already have a healthy afternoon, for example, you might try a chicken.
And I'll see you later.
Take a coffee.
This diuretic frees your body from the last water.
As already said, water and bread are your friends.
Don't contribute to painkillers.
If you take a painkiller at night to prevent a headache, your pay must be made in addition to alcohol with paracetamol or ibuprofen and lose both strength.
So broken their pay even more and then they're gonna be worse off.
In addition, pain was not allowed to remain in the body for a long time.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it completely empty - it's scarring your so-called stomach.
Or if you don't take the partner, you can handle it well with yourself.
It acts like walking, but walking doesn't get orgasm.
In contrast, too active storms and reverse storms - during the basic period, physical effort should be moderate.
You're kidding.
Take time to talk to your friends and friends, make simple pills and laugh friendlyly both yourself and others (candidacy).
A smile and a smile may not be enough, but it certainly makes it more fun to talk about the consequences.
One time it's gonna be over the base!
The professor of Northwestern and Oxford University staff are looking for a suspicious murder
The police say they are looking universally for the professor of Northwestern University and Oxford University staff who have been suspected of finding a dead man's body from one Chicago lottery.
According to the country's national court documents, on the first day of the trial, the arrest warrants were issued for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren in the first instance of their alleged murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
Document data killed 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau after repeated seizure.
According to the warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the death penalty was discovered on 27 July.
The police got phone calls and found a victim at Grand Plaza's apartment, who had a lot of tortoise.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene of the incident and the investigators considered killing while the police were actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has been working as a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
The vice-president of public relations at the University, Alan K. Cubbage, said in an e-mail address that Lathem is now temporarily removed and is now banned from entering the cities of the University of Northwestern.
"This is now with a criminal investigation by the competent authorities and the Northwestern University is working with the researchers," said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior assistant to Oxford University's financial department.
The representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mailed statement: "We have been in the community with the British police and are ready to assist the US research institutions in any way possible."
In addition, it was in a letter that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him out.
Mr Anthony Guglielm, Head of the Communications Division of the Chicago Police Department, strongly recommends that he give himself power to suspects.
"The police have a clue where they stay, but we are doing more intensively with defining the exact location," said Guglielm.
Guglielm’s statement helps to search for both local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said that the police had received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza, who had just received a cryptographic guide, that in the case no. 1008 there was something going on.
According to the police's description, it could have been seen.
Guglielm’s claim is not clear whether the event itself took place on July 27.
He said security cameras confirm Lathemi and Warren's stay in the building.
"We think Professor Lathamil and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
The Grand Plaza Board sent a letter to the residents: "Police is currently working on explaining the history of events and the background of the victim and examining various motives, including the possibility of doing so with the family."
Ancient companies that help your companies avoid getting into Uberik
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his e-commerce past, but the issues were raised.
The answers were often inseparable, used or even harmful.
And even if he agreed to ensure anonymity, some workers didn't trust this process.
"This system was simply not orderly and objective," said Errett, who leads 75 workers with San Francisco haircare products sold by Madison Reed.
So she called outsiders for help.
There are new types of human resources companies in the workplace that help businesses to explain what their employees are feeling.
In the development and licensing of software designed to measure staff involvement, they will allow businesses to carry out urgent questions, take up specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with an anonymous and hot line to submit complaints and, in some cases, allow speakers to go through C levels and turn directly to the management.
"Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit, which are intended to monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your companies?" asked Jim Barnett, co-author and manager Redwood City former company Glint, whose software analysis tools are used to measure employees' involvement.
In contrast, he has been given three years when he has been using Glint, much better than his employees think and feel.
In addition to short-term surveys and interviews with specific teams, this company will provide a hot map that provides an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which guides have the lowest support, allowing it to explain the reasons for it.
The companies have come to understand that they must remain in the course of their working culture so that they do not change into Uberik, which has been measured in scandals since the previous employer published a blog post describing the environment that was affecting those who encouraged to take the word.
For older companies such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is the result of a business opportunity.
The global management, regulatory and compliance area may be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Financial Technology Statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
In the midst of Uberi's suspicious reputation, the former Converter of Colorado, which helps businesses to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, observed the interest and activity of Uber in this year.
Convercentil has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered himself as a client.
Like Glintki, Konvertent will allow businesses to send adjusted impulses, collect confidential answers in real life, and look at the problem areas of heat maps.
This provides a uniform anonymous message line that allows employees to be informed of the misconduct of their employees.
And when it comes to the manager, the complaints will go directly to the board.
"The public opinion has been analogised by the regulatory authorities," said the founder and manager of the Conference.
In Quinlan’s statement, if it is felt that the company treats its employees badly or behaves improperly, the company may face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, departures and cases, even if the regulatory authorities are not involved.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant with more than 25,000 employees at 500 jobs, has been using the Convercent for over a year to ensure that workers are aware of the rules and activities and to offer a convenient way to contact the corporate headquarters.
If the employee wanted to report earlier the problem, he had to find the phone number or e-mail address of the corporation’s head office, submit an official complaint and expect it to be taken seriously.
It was often an exciting and unusual process, said General Commissioner James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of workers.
Now that the company is using the Convercent, however, it is possible to identify and deal with problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices that have not reached previous leaders who have acted in other cities or countries.
"I can get closer to the professional 360-kradish experience of workers," said Vitrano, who is leading the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our components from disputes with employees."
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, perhaps after hearing company Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations in connection with Enron’s scandal.
But only when "Social Media became a cause," the companies realized that they could not prevent their black sand publicly from being washed on the web.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software service by taking on a company's periodic fee for the use of their products.
This is in business and an opportunity for risk capital investors to be approved, which has been supported by both former companies.
On February 10 million dollars were financed by such companies as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital amounting to $47 million.
Glint invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing the company’s adjustment of $60 million.
Such investments shall not be surprising if they take into account the relationship between enterprises, culture and risk capital.
More and more studies show that today’s workers are expected to leave their jobs more than they used to.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, there are high wages and interesting projects on board.
Workers want to know that they are accepted and valued and that they dedicate their time to businesses with a positive mission.
"When people are happy at the company, they feel that they are listening and that the work they do is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, Vice-President of the General Benefit and Employees' Association LinkedIn, which uses both the Convercent and Glint.
Investors will benefit if their portfolio companies go well; businesses will go well when employees are dedicated and involved.
If third-party analytical tools allow employees to increase their commitment and engagement, it is not surprising that these support is available.
The fact that data are available on the involvement of workers is important in the words of employers.
But these data have been used if the company's supervisors don't have anything to do with them.
In fact, when a company asks for returns from its employer, it can create expectations for future changes.
And if changes are not made sufficiently fast or not at all, this may lead to fraud and reduce staff involvement.
"When you asked for 4,000 proposals, you must be ready for a discussion of 4,000," said Cotter International, Consulting and Business Management, President Russell Raath, who has seen how companies make a mistake of supporting too much data collection.
"Because if things don't work out, workers think, "Did you really listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
In other words, Madison Reed, who is currently conducting six studies with employees, has been able to implement the measures on the same day as Glint reported the problem.
And after making decisions, it was possible for a number of companies to reorganise and offer communication training to deal with problems.
But Ruby Tuesdays collects new data on workers and is expected to bring it with it in a long perspective, which is known for its great efficiency.
"If you're not dedicated to ensuring transparency, you'll lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies."
The euro area's stalemate is Baltic: income is growing rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic Sea, three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the entry of rich countries in Western Europe, Bloomberg refers to the European Central Bank's report.
Since 1999, the Central Bank's total economic output has exceeded expectations for people in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
The success is low debt burden, rapid improvements in institutions and business and free market-friendly policies.
"The Baltic countries in one of Slovakia are in low-euro area countries where real-SCP people have been significantly closer to the EU average," the central bank said.
Although the aim is to make the overall economic output of people rich in comparison with Western Europe, in 2015, the total economic output of the Baltic people was at least 2/3 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement.
Low wages have led the ballast to look for better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing today, local people are not equally enthusiastic.
According to the Eurobarometer study, only a quarter of Latvia and Lithuania's population estimated that their economies are going very well or longer.
Chechnya and Poland considered this to be less than half of their economies.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the trains that take place twice a day makes the days of Brunsey long
The clock is almost 23, when the UCLA football team stops chatting in the new exercise area of the team located in the university.
Some of them have slipped from the edge of the mirror by revealing their training age from the efforts of the first day to the hip.
For most of the team, these minutes of lunch are offered.
Players taking part in the short course will be moving back to the three-hour course to study at the end of the general assembly before returning to the Waterway at 6.30 a.m. on the next morning.
"The next three days is a real challenge for them," said training coach Jim Mora about before the second day came.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the train that takes place twice a day in order to reduce the burden of players has actually changed their days longer - at least until the end of the race.
For this reason, the first three UCLA trainers were scheduled to begin at 19.15 in order to adapt players to such a difficult time.
The transition from two training days to more than one train day means more than one day - the beginning of the training course in Brunsis was increased in comparison with the previous season almost a week before and for the first time during the six Westwood season during the summer courses.
They have 18 trains up to 20 August before the official preparation begins to take place in September for an open game against Texas A&M.
Mora says it is due to a change in the NCAA rules, although it adds another agenda point to the recent graphics of players.
"They have three or four days of stress and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they challenge themselves through this test; they try, they're young tortoise.
I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time, it's really boring."
When the camper has finished, UCLA will turn trainings into closures, which is not quite a simple task, given the clear view of their challenges near the parking lot and the centre of Luskin, a higher class of hotels that have already been able to cross the border around the colored grid with pedestrians.
Since this week's exchange, the hotel's players in Bruns, but Mora admitted that problems can arise with free rooms.
"Let's build security," said Mora.
"It's a real place of concern and it's not too much to think that people can rent a room and from there take training.
If you have a record of training, you can do a pretty good deal with it.
But we're using a security team at the 8th parking lot.
Let us make the best use of our own resources.
I'm not really worried about it.
We've got a plan."
As a result, the Savisare-Ivanova electorate, Christina Ojulland and KEKRE, who were forced to leave the reform sector, created by the European Union of the companies of our Tallinn and the parties to be shown the potential for the creation of a trade union of at least the same number as the private sector - seems to have been involved in the local elections by the electoral union created in the initiative of the parties to eliminate them.
However, Tibuses are read deep, and it becomes a question of whether all of them share sufficiently disappointed voters.
Who's staying with Savisare?
If the Edgar Savisare Support Area has been reduced to a small extent, it may be triggered by events organised for the opening of its electoral union.
One member of the National Assembly, some prominent and current central and many unknown faces - can this be a part of the Union of Elections?
And is there any reason why some Savisare's supporters and friends keep away from the candidacy in Tallinn can seek out the fact that the Savisare's "list", which suggests that corruption and corruption are suspected, is to be real?
The music video film filmed under the city government to the Russian populace, which is part of the oldest part of Lasnamáe; and in any sense, the original computer game in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas has to avoid the noises and noises that hit the road - is it the first time that the Central Region tries to vote in favour of the 16- and 17-year-old electoral elections?
We are waiting to see what other categories of young electoral campaigns are going on.
If channel 2 or TV3 viewers from August to August instead of the first entertainment device, there are two options: agree that only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English France24 canals will continue to be available on a monthly basis.
It is also likely that there are those who publicly enjoy advertising free of charge, but in the end - even if they are responsible - for television and advertising.
The impressive music, popular music, and thankless ramps are the most important of every major music festival.
If you don't want to get part of it yourself, it's worth letting the locals go - and the place to sleep for the amount left for the festivalers instead of the money.
Washington changes the rules of the Green Card
Media outlets quote President Donald Trump, who has a new U.S. immigration plan that changes the rules of the Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants per 50,000 people per year, more stringent rules on the acquisition of temporary jobs and restrictions on family guidance.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The legislative committee is going to discuss the convention in two homes.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars of money from taxpayers, as it changes how US citizens get green cards out.
The legislation will reduce the deficit and will replace the current programme.
The new application process gives priority to candidates who speak English and who have financial resources to support themselves and skills that will benefit our economy," said the U.S. media release Trump.
The Siberian set of young people are moving around the city, pensioners back to the country.
Jevsejevi Anatoli continues to be a tradition of ancient Mana’s great hearings.
He works from house to house 150 miles [140 km] from Mana's trailer near the city of Kavai as a golden car guide.
This is hard work: two months without rest days 12 hours work and then only 10 days home and again.
During the three years in the Artile, the gold of Anatoly has been seen on this site only once.
"There's a hard time: it's going to go in and check it out, so it won't bring wine, and out it won't take gold," Anatoly says.
Mare Piho's conversation at the local station in Haiti with Jan, who has talked to him a lot about his family's memories in Siberia.
The archaic culture that remained in Siberia is also going to influence home-sets, because it is just so relaxing, considers the most basicly remote settings studied by Piho Mare.
His first research trip to Siberia lasts 30 years.
During this time, he has walked there 14 times and lived there together for a year.
How many settlements have still migrated to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century to get the lands here?
That's an unsolved question.
I'm saying 8,000.
I've taken it out of the story of the men in Siberia who's been thinking about it.
It's hard to say exactly because at that time a group of up to 30 people could come, but the passport only gave to a man.
Pass gave only one, but with him were children, sisters, and women.
Look how big that territory was here!
It was a number of times more than historical Setom.
It was necessary to learn it, to manage it in some way.
The set came here as wetlands, but their lives changed because they were here in areas not only related to agriculture but also to the sea (petroleum), oil spills, industry.
For example, many sets went to work later in the city of Krasnojarsk-45 (which built the power of the Council's ironing plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the sets form a majority of the population in that region?
Yeah, they lived together.
In addition, the tradition of marriage and polygamy remained a long one.
Seven-eight children were normal.
How much different culture of Siberi sets and different from the mother's own?
They're different, even though what was produced here was once the same.
They brought a lot of people together.
So they also made themselves (the peoples), but they always made a difference between what was produced and what was done here.
Climate change has strongly influenced the traditional clothing of seto because it is colder here.
The food's changed.
For example, the meat of Setomaal was salted, but it was simply frozen here.
Where are the visitors to the Siberian settlement and what life is there? / Graphic: Alari Paluots
His relationship with his mother was spiritually strong, and it was considered very important.
I think now it's going to give Setumaa back there, it's going to affect them.
These girls who have lived here in this family have heard amazing stories.
In view of the people of the Estonian settlement delegation who came to Haiti early in July on the day of the Kingdom of Seto and lived at home for four days - J. P.
What's still here, it's boring.
"The table is universally coming and going, too, because the city has a great place: at the railway crossing point and at the crossing point of the land," says Taipalt from the official Reigo Tamm.
The city is no longer a military haven, we have a lot of nature, a place of sport and culture, and a lot of dirt gets on every corner.
Kill is a tip-up city!
There is a small island on the shore of the White Sea across the city where the people are familiar with the janitorial landscape.
"It doesn't look like it's beautiful about the train window," recalls Reigo.
He who is not afraid of cold water will sink into the river, because the sea is full of sources.
I've been there for a while. It's gonna be all right!
The fish can keep a picnic and just make romantic - the fish can see the flow and think about life and want.
I've been walking there with my cousins too.
Operative Tamm has gone on the other side of the river between the three of them practicing their aarids: "That this place is at the edge of the city, no one will be responsible for it if his stories are man."
"The human brain opens a wonderful view of the Table, but there are also health providers, where you can enjoy the winter and now play discgolfi - golf is done, you can borrow from the sports center," says Reigo.
The old professors are going there with their kids, but I haven't been there to play.
It is likely that Mr Rasmus Kulll Tabal has been invited because he has experienced a discholfing problem and has endured.
He'll loan me!
Reigo and Männikumät were currently in the process of obstetriculating children.
At least for hours.
There's been a lot of pirates, frauds, and you've won my sport.
I'm not talking about broken legs and joints.
"The whole center is now full of buildings, all of which is becoming unconscious," Reigo says.
However, killing an old and tired vassal building is a very attractive place to play in the harvest.
I am glad that in 2012 R.A.A.A.A.M. leader Mart Meos accepted my idea and came to make a vassal suvet theatre with his theatre.
Although today's theater time "Aleksei Karenin" has just passed, on 11 August there is a railway station "Ellusion", when the old van is moved around in the 1980s.
"11-13 August is the days of the town of Tapa which has opened the vassal building with open houses, and there are numerous cultural events, including public events," says Reigo, who recommends that the city be visited from 91 years of age.
The museum has been in the small hall of May 1, 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibitions are very much and information is very expensive," Reigo says, which is full of the history of the town of Tapa, most of which focuses on rail and war.
Reigo remembers that when all the recommended places pass through the Tapal, the white leaves go to the deep well, but fortunately, there are little coffees full.
"We have so good restaurants and coffee breaks sometimes make you feel like you're out there," she explains.
Students and young soldiers who come to Tabal spend a lot of time in pubides-coffees, sitting there is a wonderful feeling that you are in Estonia and your hometown, but the environment is such an international society together.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from French or American hands.
Soldiers, yeah, we're moving too much!
Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal treatment
On TV, BTV spoke to the Foreign Ministry, who announced that two Bulgarians had been taken to Greece for illegal treatment.
On the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of people who were illegally beaten by two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but now the investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV TV that Bulgarians were being released later.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free movement and are already imposing a severe fine on all those who remain in a place of rest which is not provided for.
The checks will continue throughout the watch.
According to the Ministry, a fine may be imposed by the court.
Dogs teach hundreds of dogs walk in the direction of the lamb.
After a year, the Chiomaa lodgers have had to give the hunters their class "learning material" - probably the dogs who have been taught by the cats have already been bitten by a lot of lamb.
Today, hundreds of thousands of people in Hiiu's territory have killed their lamb three times, totaling 23 and injured eight times, writes Hiiu Leht.
The number was only three, 124 years ago.
There is also information from the environmental agency in the case of murder that Mullu Chiumaal did not have a dog share and that the Hiimaa hunting council was informed that two dog areas were fixed on the island this year.
On the first day of the night, hundreds of Emmaste killed 15 lambs in the village of Kabuna and injured 18 others from half the lamb.
On the spring of the third day, hundreds of Reheselja visited one of the country’s branches and severely injured others who had to be killed.
Rules for the handling of genetically modified agricultural products must be clear
The Ministry of Agriculture sent a proposal for the introduction of genetically modified organic environment legislation (GMOVS) and the amendment of plant protection legislation.
The amendment of the legislation exempts the creation of separate data collection for both genetically modified (GM) agricultural sites and users, using the Register of Plant Health.
In addition, the obligation of the GM agricultural operator to enter into an earlier agreement with the person involved in the radius provided for in this Regulation shall be amended.
Although there is currently no genetically modified agricultural culture in Estonia, we need clear rules for the co-existence of genetically modified and unchanged agriculture.
At least until you have decided to preach free of charge to Estonia's GMO," said Sigmar Suu, head of the Ministry of Agriculture's Department of Agriculture.
"It must also be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden associated with both the private sector and the public sector," added Suu.
The proposal for a regulation repeals the provisions relating to the location and training of GM farmers and operators, sets out the requirements for the handling of GM farming and economic activity.
In particular, in relation to measles, the GM farmer shall be replaced by the former obligation to inform the machinery of the beginning of GM cultivation by the obligation to reach an agreement with the appropriate machinery prior to the beginning of growth.
The draft legislation shall be sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to know about this in the information system and, where appropriate, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Land.
The proposed changes affect, in particular, the people, the machinery and the Agency for Agriculture operating in the area of agriculture.
The European Union, including Estonia, is allowed to grow only one GM agricultural culture - May MON 810.
However, no Estonian agricultural producer has so far been interested in the growth of GM agriculture.
The reason is that there is no malformation in Estonia, a European currency code for which the MON 810 maize is resistant.
Also, the varieties of this maize are developed in southern regions and this maize is not suitable for our climate conditions.
The preliminary product for safety has been commissioned by the Ministry of Agriculture in 2015 and 2016 by the Ministry of Agriculture to detect possible contaminations with GM organisms in seed of various strains, maize and soybean growing in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds of the network were not included and as a result of the study, it was concluded that the seeds of the strains, maize and soybeans grown in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms.
In the past, it may be concluded that there is no known genetically modified farming in Estonia and it has also been confirmed that there has not been any accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United in the "Genesis" form of Nemanja Maticu
Jose Mourinho believes that the Manchester Uniteds has colored Nemanja Maticu's "geneise", after the midwife Sampdor made her debut three days ago.
Over 40 million laughs from Chelsea, a player bought by the former player in Dublin, started the last time of the game before Uefa Super Cupi Real Madrid won 2-1 on the second day of winning 2-1, publishing memories in a security room, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were able to go free of attacks.
But having left Blues on the east coast of Asia, Maticul was desperately in need of massage and was only 45 minutes behind him. This must certainly be done before the beginning of the Premier League.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant way of thinking--he has football minds," said Mourinho.
"Let's help him get the form on his first chance."
Like Matic, the Aviva stadium also started with the other new colorful Victor Lindelof and Romelu Luka and Mourinho, however, started to start the season with a man who started his union.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wants to color three yet-and-a-half-foot balls, but he confirmed that the club has already done "great work" by concluding agreements with three of its four priorities.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realize three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make four, but they've been hard on me."
The next time the son of a whore got his leg on August 1st, and so on in Muhus.
According to the data provided by the live observer, Mati Martinson, the first son of a bitch with the sender was in Sräves and this crew is already flying around, has left the beach and joined the Mullutu-Surlahe great nighttime assembly.
That's because there's no harvest ground in Sårves, it's written in the voice of the Isles.
On the other day, it was relatively late to heal the wounds, another son of a bitch and this one on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinsson, the installation of the senders is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
The memory was equipped with a son-in-law named Mati GSM at Sröves Turjul.
"His actions are all visible on the Internet: how he went to Spain in the winter, back came a piece of time at the border between Germany and Poland and then came to the island," said Martinson.
The British explorer allowed his body to install microkib to access his home and car
The British explorer was the first person in a country to be installed a microchip so that he could easily open his offer, get to the office, and even start a car.
33-year-old Steven Northam has been able to install a small kit between his desk and his nominee and now offers this service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with their technology.
He has joined the Royal Hospital Consultant-Anesthesiologist in the province of Hampshire, Winchesteris Hansis, to ensure compliance with medical standards with the installation procedure.
Technology is similar to that of cats and dogs, and the procedure shall take up to 30 seconds.
Northami’s company also exchanges houses and cars to combine them with the grass, asking for one of its 300 laughs.
This marriage of one child's father has installed technology for now both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which runs when he's in the role.
The White House exhibition went to pay thousands of taxpayers
According to the paper published by the TIME, the White House decided to fly off the sea helicopter last month to pay $24,000 for an event that took place in the United States.
The green and white color Sikorksky VH-3D, named during the presidential election to Marine One, was the central milestone of the American construction program held in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and White House senior officials reviewed industrial products in their rounds from all 50 countries.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exposed together with a train from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a coffee truck from Mississippi.
According to the documents of the European Parliament of the European Union, the European Parliament and the Council, as well as the Council of Ministers of the European Communities and the Council of the European Communities, have been able to ensure that the European Parliament and the Council take steps to ensure that the European Parliament, the Council and the European Parliament take steps to ensure that the European Parliament, the Council and the European Parliament take steps to ensure that the European Parliament and the Council take the necessary steps to ensure that the European Parliament and the Council take the necessary steps to ensure that the European Parliament and the Council take the necessary steps to ensure that the Council take action in order to ensure that the European Parliament are in accordance with the procedure set out in force.
"I think you'd be aware of this because this is an abnormal event under consideration," said HMX-1 Commander on the day before the incident occurred in his e-mail to his superior, the seaman in the field of flight.
The message indicated that the helicopter will arrive at the south end of July 17 in the morning at 7 p.m. to start at 15 p.m. and will remain there until the same night at 18 p.m. to 21 p.m.
The fact was added that if leaving the White House was to continue, a return flight would be necessary because of the working time constraints.
The initial flight team was at the helicopter during the incident and the squadron security team remained in the vicinity of the aircraft during its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to read from the document supplied by TIME whether or not another team was needed.
The Hatchi legislation prohibits federal employees from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that in the HMX-1 study, the event given may break this provision.
"We asked if it violates Hatchi's law and told us that it's not wrong," wrote the commander.
"You don't seem to have a choice," said the Chief Commander.
The White House announced an official event for the "Prepared in America" event and Hatchi's law would not cover it.
But even official events have political subatoons.
On that occasion, the President supported the efforts of the health-care reform in the Senate during the discussion and thanked the efforts made to keep the government's regulations in line with them.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for political revenue is no new event.
The Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them as photosenance is unusual.
In February, Trump took note of the fact that at his first campaign in Florida Melbourne, he was following the president's flight back, and his Twitter account was covering messages that hurt about how his former president's planes were used.
"The Valgel House is very pleased with the proposal "Prepared in America" which represented products from all 50 countries that have produced American materials," said the President of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 teams often run around Washington and south of the ocean trying to practice a symmetrical approach to the White House of President of the United States.
When Trump was in early July at the G20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 White House conducted 58 trials.
According to the officer, the flight was considered to be part of the standard of training for the flight team "Prepared in America" for that month.
On that day, Escaadry helicopters flew for another 11 hours for "non-presiding support missions".
According to the White House, no other exhibition of this event will be charged to pay for the money.
According to the representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in the holding of an exposure on the southern corner of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not maintain the precise costs arising from the president's flight budget documents and events are difficult to explain.
However, according to the estimates of the Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017, VH-3D compensation amounts to $24,380 for my flight.
The Eskaadr documents marked the length of the flight from the main seaport of Quantico from Virginia at 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is very low.
"The calculation of the cost of taxpayers on the basis of the estimated remuneration rates is very complex," Walters said.
"These assessed rates of remuneration include staff, care and many other non-recurrent costs taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the remuneration rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include staff costs, but they cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
White House former President Sean Spicer protected the use of a helicopter at the time.
"The point of the matter is to show this week something made in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that the country of Sikorsky and Connecticut is very proud of their contribution to our national security and that there is an estimated hundred if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, where so many Americans have seen less difficult.
So of course it's right to raise it."
It is not clear whether Trump was missing in the southern corner of the scene during a roundabout trip with a helicopter or not, but the car wanted to sit on it.
In the White House, Trump Sikorsky turned to the representatives of the media and jokes about the products of the company over him in his private airport.
"I know Sikorskyt very well," said the president, "I have three products."
Grit Šadeiko - Peace and Happiness Through the Pirate Gates
In 2011, MMil Daegus lost Šadeikot in the last field, 800 m during the walk of foot-and-mouth and was driven from the stadium by the milk to the canderami.
Just before he got it, he had got a zero in China's hidden university.
In 2012, Helsinki’s EMI fell victim to domestic violence, but the London Debytolympia was hit by 6013 point 23.
Unfortunately, it didn't go on.
In 2013 Moskva MMil received a post-pocket development in Estonia’s record chart after the opening day.
Two years later he got to Beijing MMil 15 and fulfilled the Olympic norm, but he wanted more sport fraud.
The most difficult challenge came through Şadeiko only when he was not initially able to write a letter from the Amsterdam EM on the way through.
I just wanted to put together one or more regular multiplicity.
Once," Shadeiko said.
It was even worse: a month later his Olympics ended because of Rios’ bicycle racing.
The time has come to take over. Do you want to keep up with the seven-year-old?
Is it worth all this effort for two days?
He thought of them for a long time, but he found peace in himself.
I got to think about it.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I've been thinking that the past spring and Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, it was time to treat yourself well and keep your head clean.
"I knew I wasn't going to put a box on the table yet," says Şadaiko about his own purity.
I was able to turn the clean paper and move on with the new hat.
Trainer Anne Mägi said the suffering of care was very difficult to see, but he realized that, in particular, the sport had to come to its own light.
He was so impressed by all of them.
It was hard to swallow.
"But Grit said she didn't give up and she wanted to prove to herself what she was worth," says Megi.
Now she has some kind of peace.
He does it for his pleasure.
The appeal came back in May when Šadeiko set up a new Estonian record of 6280 points on Götz’s cross-section.
In the high-level competition, he improved his personal top marks by about a meter (13.89) and during the record period.
Then the Ombudsman recognized that it was not a species of power, but it was the first point of competition to be removed.
Mägi, who's been leading him for years, says that Şadeiko is a model student.
He's ready for sports, he's good to train.
If something's wrong or it's wrong, he'll say it right away.
He knows his body and trusts his consciousness.
We gotta get out of this.
I can't tell you exactly what to do, and we'll follow it.
A new approach has also been found in Šadeiko.
"I'm not the one who trains the maximum," he says and says, "the most important thing is to get the right recognition, because it also ensures a good outcome.
Closely related babies make them happy
Good emotions have also been offered to Shadeko by close friends.
Both his former coaches Maris May and Sister Grete recently became a child and a multi-stakeholder has received new support from the air-citizens.
"It's quite interesting," says Şadeiko.
One of the alcohols that food is equal to brain "training".
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Shepherd is so big a wine fan that he believes - he can train his brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
His statement is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but about the "very active" process of wine taste.
When the class is up, the wine juice is turned around, it's fun and we'll put on our brain work to make wine taste.
The Sheperd’s words do not actually contain wine wafers, but the taste makes a way of stimulating the wine brain.
He'll be compared to how the brain "sees" the color.
"There's no wine, there's no wine," says Sheperd.
For example, other factors that affect the taste of wine are our age, gender, and even the amount of food that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, feels that wine isn't enough to make himself drunk.
"There's got to be more work," she says.
If you take too much loyalty, the system's overloaded.
Overindulging wine may harm the brain rather than harm it - according to the 2004 study, people who eat more than three glasses of wine, smoking, losing balance and losing their spiritual ability.
10% of Estonian ICT staff receive less pay than colleagues
The staffing company's data in Fontes shows that 10% of Estonian ICT staff receive less pay than colleagues.

Fontese participated in the ICT sector wage survey of 59 IT and telecommunications companies.
A total of 8,577 posts were under review.
63% of the posts were worked by men.
"While only 3 companies claimed that wage inequality is for the benefit of men and that there is no wage gap for the rest of the companies, in reality, there is a monthly basis for men's work on average 10% higher than women's own and a total annual wage on men's average 8% higher on women's property," said Fontese analyst Ilmar North.

The United Nations has a role to play in the political role of women in Afghan democracy
On the third day, the Head of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan said that elections can only be made up of people when all members of society, including women, play their part.
UN-assistance leader Nicholas Haysom said that hundreds of women are candidates for local council elections, three women are candidates as vice-presidents and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women.
"The importance of women cannot be overemphasized," he said in a three-day statement.
Elections can truly represent and be believed only when women participate fully and are involved in the electoral process at all stages.
The elections and presidential elections of the local Councils of Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has been threatened by the electoral process, which coincides with the transition period when the role of international military operations becomes advisable.
This year's elections mark the first time that a democratically elected government can be granted the following opportunity.
Haysomi says that women play a strong role in the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission in Afghanistan, there are 1.2 million women registered from 3.6 million voters.

Imetore is to use children instead of kids!

The plan is overwhelming, but for the child, it is hopelessly endless.
But it's easy to have fun!
Game plank: Take a long beach column, from which to swim over again.
Actually, it's usually harder, but it's much more fun to do it when you can hand it over to a friend.
To add weight, you can stay on the beach, on the small market, and also walk around in this setting.
In addition, children may be forced to sit on trees, but this exercise offers fun for all children.
At the same time as cancers get too high, they get tributary, dust and muscle weights like bone.

From the Philippines to the world, perhaps the Olympics traveled into the hearts of the moefans
In the past few years, red houses have been a seed-class from which they have received their own hits, which, on one of the right side of the soybean market, must be cut straight into their hands and which have been able to prevent trademen from returning their origin.
The red box, probably one of the things that has always been alive and has not produced any special emotions.
It's just there, and if it's not, there's nothing wrong with it.
Now, however, the prospectors have made real victory times and the moenas have changed their heavy designs into winters over the boxes of plain gold.
This is not only a practice with the sunnato, but today it is also so popular as the sunnacoto, and even stronger women walk to the office.
However, it is worth making it clear before it is clear whether the ceiling is still sitting or paying for the mark and the amount of oil is to be cut to a slightly official sum.
In contrast, there has been a lack of cooperation on the part of Orthodox women.
For example, when reading foreign moeblogs, first of all, it remains to be seen that moegurs prove themselves to the local market for the first time and call themselves a dormitory, where the whole holiday season is safe and which goes along the sea, the market, and even with friends around the city.
Some bloggers are so brilliant that they buy more fat from the market and sell it or give it to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that there is so much demand for readers after the boxes that women (and men) in the world of origin are likely to go to each other’s throats to make some home a happy owner.
In some sense, this is also understandable, as these are rare times when it is possible for them to buy something up to a minimum of EUR.
Indeed, the planned traders have also found a simple way of financial service and thus sell smaller luxury brands for several and a thousand euros.
It seems, however, that the richer customers should not be easily aware of those who walk around with some perishable bags.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana over a thousand euros for rent.
However, for the translation of Chanel's mortgage, it can go out in the round of EUR 6000.
Unlike most moeches, however, the moeches do not come from some great moeme, but their history is far from the start.
In this name, they are said to have come from far away from the Philippines, where they have been scattered without them.
It is not very common to see house carvings, especially with exhibitors and locals walking around them.
It is said that it comes from the 14th century of oil mining and is, of course, strict with normal taxation.
However, since the roof must not be as strong as the roof, it can be fitted with patterns and other materials that make the home more personal and attractive.
For example, recently there are particularly trendy homes where colorful leaves or skin rashes have been added.
The letter of thanks may be sent, in particular, to exhibitor Jane Birkin, of whom the largest reded octopus ever seen.
On behalf of him, he adapted to all possible clothing sets and did not even have to go to Cannes' film festival.
In today’s population, however, there is no less important role to play in caring for them, and unlike all other lovers, it is not necessary to take care of them with special means, but it is also a water and a brand of sand.
As with trends in employment, the brands that have come out of the classical era have come out with all possible translations.
For example, if you wish, you can pick yourself up an oil-stained or high-stained oil tank.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic dome is never going from the moon to the moon, but it is.
But what's a classic legend?
Already centuries have been regarded as classicly decorated box of gold that mentions its style of corpus, has been opened on its side and has shorts, as well as gold bars.

GMB damages investments in the company McVitie's Glasgow factory
The company expects the company's manufacturer McVitie to confirm long-term production plans in Glasgow's factory.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has changed to the future of the Tollcross object investment.
In the factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea are produced cookies and other products, more than 500 people work.
McVitie's owner Pladis said they've invested more than 5 million laughs over the last few years.
There, workers and members of the company "the first ones who listen" were hired if something changes in their activity.
In a letter sent to the company's objective owner, a reference was made to the GMB Scotland company McVitie's request "to resolve concerns about the fact that the funding is not used to modernise production lines".
GMB old organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we do not get the object leader's clarity about Tollcross's business and future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned.
There have been several generations of families working here, and the labour force is largely composed of local society and the people of the Glasgow community, which is essential to ensure more regular employment in the region where there is high employment and social exclusion.
As a result, Glasgow needs jobs, wages and well-being from the east, and Brexit, the rise in living costs and the decline in production in the production sector of McVitie."
The representative of Pladise said: "The Tollcross object manager received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company answers it directly because we value the active relationship with employees and representatives of the company.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between Tollcross workers and GMB representatives was held, where several problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and insecure economic climate, we are looking at our activities in the course of - and this applies to all our companies and objects - in order to ensure their competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years we have invested over 5 million laughs in Tollcross's object, most of it has gone into production lines and completion of operations.
We fully understand the origin of the Tollcross and if any changes should take place in the operation of the object, the workers and representatives of the company are the first to hear about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about approaching Neymar?
La Liga can regret her interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain does not allow attempts to lure Neymar into his bikes, making him offer 189 million laughs. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record-break?
This comical approach has opened up as a summer pass and League 1 club is ready to break more than twice the current world record of overruns, which was built last summer by Paul Pogba returning to Manchester Uniteds 89 million laughs.
Once the transition has been completed, Neymar will be awarded by the world's highest player and equally the highest paid professional sport in the world, which will be paid after the payment from PSG to over 500,000 laughs a week.
Barcelona has been angry about how close it is to both Neymari and how close it is, although the source of the approach to the Catalan government confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the football team since its arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the president of the PSG warn the football world about this opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in the conclusion of an agreement with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi strongly warned all clubs that are thinking of some PSGs when recruiting the best player.
"I don't worry, because they know that if they touch some of our players, we will accept them and contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they're trying to make a deal with some of our players, they have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this border since the Spanish club showed an interest in this summer's PSG-mediumman Marco Verratt.
The PSG made it clear that they are not going to leave Italy under any condition and that Barcelona can get this interest back by losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build a bridge after Brexit, not a border.
"Brexit is seriously threatening to strike a gap between Northern Ireland and Ireland, the United Kingdom and Ireland," Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland after his official stay in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border tariff projects have changed the possibility of free movement of current people and goods, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: building a bridge, not a border," he stressed.
In the words of the paper, it would prefer the absence of Britain as part of the European Union, and since it is not possible to do so, it would be part of the European Community.
This would remain between the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
The second option to make leaving Britain more attractive would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Prime Minister of Ireland explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could certainly have such a deal with Britain."
It would be an alternative to returning to customs points that would indicate historical reconciliation and political transition.
"Do business, travel and peace," said the Prime Minister of Ireland.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that this outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's everyday life.
The Prime Minister of Ireland met in Belfast on a visit to the leaders of the main parts of Northern Ireland.
The first half of his triathlon passed through Mart Avandi: Ironman can pass through everyone.
Today, the highest triathlon festival in the Baltic Sea was held in the winter when about a thousand triathletes from more than thirty countries were present in the area of Iran.
The distance of 70.3 miles was 1,9 km from the village, 90 km from the train and 21,1 km from the train.
On the other hand, Mart Avandi successfully completed his first triathlon of his life.
"I think it's going to be difficult and it's going to be difficult at last," Avandi said.
Despite the difficulty, Avandi was convinced that Triathlon is actually a powerful head for everyone.
"Not far away will not kill, but the pace will kill," he said, pointing out that by the time of the end, everyone will be able to finish.
Except for Ott Sep: "Ott with physics is all right, but he can't swim."
Avandi had been on the train since February.
At the start of 4-5 hours a week, but at the end of 10 hours a week.
At 05:34:12, he reached 270.
Although Avandi lost both Raio Piiroja (at 04:59:53) and Jürgen Lig (at 05:06:37), he won the other so-called "prominent class" battles.
Last year, Tanel Padar lost Avandi with seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Stan Teppan with 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm with about an hour (time according to 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
The first stage of the Ironman series was crowned by German John Molda at 3:58:27, of the Estonians was the best Ivo Great at 04:14:09.

He got out of the water at 410.
