When are you doing the shopping?
When are you doing your shopping?
When are you doing your shopping?
Where are you from?

What's the job?

Why are they so bad about us?
Why are we running?

The tree is burning.
It's raining.

You have to sign this.

You're so short.
You're too many words.
You're the leader.
You're running.
You know.
You know I'm in love with Mary.
You tried.
You tried.
You were supposed to wait.
You were supposed to wait.
