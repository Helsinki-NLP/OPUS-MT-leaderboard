28-year-old father found dying in a large factory in San Francisco
This Sunday in a large supermarket there was a 28-year-old man who recently moved to San Francisco .
But the victim's brother says that he can't imagine anyone who would want to hurt his brother, saying, "His life finally started to improve."
Líchi, who was found on Wednesday at the University of Westfield, was identified as a 28-year-old Sanfrancian citizen, Franks Galicia, a representative of the Sanfrancian Medical Expert Office.
The French police reported that her death was recognized as a fraud and is currently under investigation.
Upura's brother Luis Galicia tells the San Francisco radio station ABC KGO that Frank had previously worked as a fireman in Boston, but six months ago he believed in his dream at the Sons & Daughters Sanfranski restaurant.
The representative of the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" reports that the news of her death shocked them and shocked them.
"We are a small team that works as a united family and we are very lacking," said the representative.
During this difficult time, we thought we were together with friends and family from France.
Luis Galicia says that at first Franks were in the hostels, but lately life was finally improving.
"He picked up a new apartment and met a girl," Luis tells the KGO radio station.
Luis Galicia claims he doesn't know who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always fed his family by preparing a spiritual meal and preparing lunch," said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in the fighting.
He was the brother who adapted to the others.
"In view of all that has happened in the world quickly, he was like an unprocessed diamond that died suddenly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the event is invited to call the SFPD Information Phone 415-575-4444.
New doctor strike: calls for new protests
The new doctors ask their trade union to initiate protests against a new contract.
The New Medical Committee (JAK) of the United Kingdom Medical Association (LMA) is preparing to ask the Council to support further protests in early September.
The JAK considers that ministers have not been able to raise doubts about the contract.
In July, new doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by the LMA.
58 % of all members who participated in the vote voted against the contract.
In a letter published on Thursday evening on Twitter, a member of the U.S. Council of America, Elena Maccorta, said that the government was continuing to listen to this issue and therefore the offer of the contract was rejected.
She said: "In view of this, the proposal for a contract as a result of the US vote has been completely rejected and decided to request new formal talks to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the Government's closure, the UK today formally requested the LMA Council to authorise the development of new contracts which would take effect in September.
As a result of the conflict, new doctors participated in six strokes, including the first time in NHS's history, which stopped work.
Following the vote, which rejected the terms of the contract offered by the LMA recommended by BMA, the LMA new doctor's representative, Dr. Johan Malwana, resigned.
Before meeting with 54 000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and will be accepted.
After the vote, the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunts, informed us that the contract would be concluded with English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: Attituto Alliance?
The pain that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey were held on Tuesday to discuss and report eight months of long terms and economic sanctions at the end of the war.
However, when Vladimir Putin met with the Turkish leader in St. Petersburg, he felt that these partnerships were more necessary for Ankara.
However, they both argued.
Vladimira Putina’s smile looked at the meeting and did not give rise to warm emotions, even taking into account her apparent state of mind.
On the other hand, Rajips Erdogans at least five times named Putin as his "dear friend" of the message.
I don't know how many.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve until the pre-crisis level but will become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had acted as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm is causing a lot of controversy.
However, a report from Putina shows that Russia’s leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the destruction of Russia’s aircraft on the Syrian border.
At the same time, Moscow responded.
Putin accused Ankar of having a dozen of them in Moscow's back.
The abuse was even more painful in view of the fact that it came from a friend.
The restoration of true trust will be very difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Since November, Russia’s public position has changed.
For several months the government controlled television spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
They thought everyone was guilty of being Turkish.
The most serious allegations were that the Erdogan family itself benefited from the illegal oil trade with part of Syria under the control of the Islamic State.
He himself, of course, refused.
However, the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
Finally, this meeting was only because Putin received President Erdogan's apology.
Russia could view it as its kind of victory.
The benefits of Ancara from the peace agreement are obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all his potential friends after a failed recovery in the past month, where he tried to recover.
countless terrorist attacks have also undermined her position.
There are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have caused substantial losses, particularly the ban on charters, which usually provides for several million Russian tourists arriving in Turkey's areas each year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tourism operators and charter companies have also facilitated flights when regular flights are renewed.
They are looking forward to holiday in the Middle Sea season.
This week the national TV is already planning to reduce the prices of fruit and vegetables as the imports of fruit and vegetables from Turkey will be renewed.
As elsewhere in the local newspaper Vedemosti: "Tourists to them, to us."
However, there were other political reasons for the visit from Moscow.
Ankara is friendly to the West about, of course, a weak response to the challenge.
All can also see the dissatisfaction with the long-term negotiations on joining the EU and Putin, which best serves the situation of Turkey's withdrawal from the West.
Russia’s leader certainly received additional points in Ankara’s eyes, expressing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well because it is deeply rooted in the fear of changing the regime.
The summation that took place in this Greek seaport gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as one analyst called it, the two countries that felt that they had been expelled from the West are united.
In spite of public unity, however, there are still considerable differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main differences affect Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peace haven, but indeed Russia and Turkey support the opposing parties.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, the two Presidents at the press conference announced that they had not discussed this issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the issues of non-compliance between the two countries, while President Putins wanted to stress them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries could find common language on the issue of Syria.
However, after months of bad relations and potential disasters have been discovered when Turkey, a NATO member of the Russian Air Force, announced that the situation has improved as both leaders have at least begun negotiations.
Scotland Royal Bank will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The Bank’s Executive Director will continue to play a role in helping SMEs.
In addition to Scotland, SMEs will no longer be available.
Ross Makevans tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB label was associated with bank ambitions at global level.
It has given up these ambitions because the bank had nearly collapsed eight years ago and needed financial assistance.
Only experts in the labelling strategy have used the SKB label to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of tickets from international sports sponsors starting with the Six Nations regime and ending with the Vimblon Tennis Championship of the Andean Murey.
However, it is now decided to draw up other national labels in the draft.
The Scottish Royal Bank will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all references to the SKB, outside the main office and the official list of beer, will be replaced by the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank has already been used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Now there will also be less private financial marks, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Macevan was interviewed during a tour with clients and employees via Invernesshire.
He sent BBC Scotland Channel: "The SKB will become our investor's brand and our employees will work with it, because now we become more of a brand bank."
In time, the bank became a global sign, and the SKB became a global sign.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their sector and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
The SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring "Six Nations" and will be involved in sponsoring various brands.
"It has been a real time to become a brand bank because we have already asked ourselves how to become a better bank for our customers?" said the Executive Director.
Three years ago it would have been very Chinese if we announced that we would become a large bank to our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and focusing on customer needs, rather than on our own needs, we have obviously made big changes.
We can relive these signs, so I think it's the right time now.
Frankis Detori won the 3000th victory, winning the first place in New York with the Iron Curtain Predilation
Detori recaptures the champagne by winning his 3000 wins twice as soon as he ends up in New York City first.
On Friday, French poet Detor won his 3,000th victory in the history of Britain, winning the first place in New York City.
He achieved it by defeating the second victory in these events that took place in his hometown of Predillection, which is trained by John Gosdens.
At 45 years of age, Italy is a six-year-old bird that has achieved such results in the birds' nests.
He joined Seram Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pigot, Pitt Eder and William Carson.
The three-time champion of Detor, who had previously won the Ghyyyar horse, said, "It's something special."
I'm very upset because my family is here.
I am very happy that this has happened in New York because I have lived here for 30 years.
This isn't a big deal, it's not a royal Ashot, but it's a common Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After victory, Detori and Predillection are expected with applause and applause.
Two jokes have reached this record in line with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and the final 20-year-old champion Sers Antony Mackojos, who has set up several records in his career, defeating more than 4300 winnings.
Lester Pigots, the nine-year-old winner, won 4493 wins during his career.
Franky is one of the best jokes today and there is no surprise that he has achieved achievements that are only rarely possible.
He's quiet and strong, but his tactics make him feel different from other jokes.
He's a fantastic young man's representative, his enthusiasm and his years of charisma attach fans to this kind of sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Epsomas that he would have won 6000 victories if he didn't participate only in the weekend and the big ones.
However, it is a real joy to know that for 30 years, France has been a regular winner of the United Kingdom.
He is a life-sustaining man who greatly benefits the British, and he is a great hunter.
Frank Detor noted this achievement with his company's brand - the flying decision.
From the wind speed of completion to the flying decision, Franky Detor has been the face of British knights for 20 years.
This has been a full way of life.
He has won countless great victories, including the famous 1996 "Great Seventh" in Ascot, and has also experienced the disaster and disqualification of aircraft for the use of preparations.
Three years ago he had difficulty returning after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his character by encouraging those who doubted him to return in his best form.
And he could have participated in conversation for some time - Detor has previously said that to welcome continued participation will be held by at least 50 years of age.
Russian President Putins resigned the Chief Administrator Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putins unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov, head of administration.
Ivanov has been found for many years in the nearest town of Putina.
At 63 years of age, an old politician has been appointed as a special representative in matters of nature and transport.
The Kremlin Communication states that Putin "has decided to release Ivanov from the duties of the director of the work of the Russian President", without giving any reason.
Mr Vaino, who has been his vice-president since 2012, has been appointed to serve in Ivanov.
44-year-old Vaino has won a diploma.
The case was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, graduated from the Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
As sent by Kremlin’s website (in Russian), he later led the President’s protocol and the management of government staff.
After appointing Putin, he said, "Thank you for your faith."
I believe that the main work of the administration is to support your work in the role of the President of the State by developing laws and controlling the implementation of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian company on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave the office and recommended Vaino as his replacement.
Do you believe in dreams?
This step has undermined Moscow.
Sergey Ivanovs is a wise and close friend of Vladimir Putina and, like Putin, has worked in the Security Council at his own time in the VDK.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At a national television station, two men announced that Ivanov would withdraw from the office on his own initiative.
But in spite of the nightmares facing the cameras, which are rarely confirmed by such an explanation, especially before Parliament's elections.
Is this the result of a struggle for power?
Nobody knows that.
However, the official claim that a man who was considered to be a potential president immediately wanted to become a leader of Russia's environmental policy is covered by a large shield.
In the comments published on the Kremlin page Ivanovs says to Putin: "This is the fact that in early 2012, I asked you to trust this complicated task, I could even say, a problem task, four years.
It will appear that I have worked on this task for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He was previously Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former VDK State Security Service, as well as Putins.
In the late 1990 ’ s, Putins led the Federal Security Service, which is the successor of the VDK, and Ivanovs took over his vice president’s office.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
At the end of the second term, Ivanovs was considered to be a potential candidate for the position of the Russian President, since the election of Putin to the third term would be an anti-constitutional.
But then another neighbor of Putina’s family became president - Dmitry Medvedevs.
Putin became prime minister, and after three and a half years he returned to the president's office.
Showing fish in a garden in the city of Banfas
A man from Banfa asks for help in explaining the conditions of the species of fish shown in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Beins thinks that 75 fish could be a rough weasel that has left with a water stop .
Mr. Beina, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a fish video on the Periscope website, hoping that someone would know how these five inches of large fish landed in his garden.
Cruise of the winery: the fabric is now connected to Faifu.
It is now planned to complete the 1,35 billion-dollar projects in May 2017.
The engineers have joined the northern part of the Quinsferi crossing and moved, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faifu.
The first of the four connecting parts is completed, meaning that the construction of the bridge is nearing completion.
The construction of the Fafias bridge is 600 metres long and 30 000 tonnes heavy.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 supporting cables.
The project worth 1.35 billion peas is currently planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keits Brauns had returned to the building site today and was one of the first to hit the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historical event in the building of the vineyard."
In this project we see an inexhaustible engineering solution, where only over 30,000 tons of cement and steel were used in this part's construction.
Despite the heavy weight and size of the bridge, the link between the bridge and the bridge is an extremely delicate process in which there is a need for great precision.
In total, more than 79% of the roof floor has already been built and the last phase that will be included in the bridge with Rosita today means that all parts of the roof are ready to be included.
"The first connection is a very important point in any bridge construction," says Michael Martins, director of the fourth bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates the construction of the high-class engineering industry.
After the last stage of the installation and its connection to the north tower support, we are left with the northern stage with a part of the ground or a half.
This was done by breaking up a part of the north-east approach of 700 millimetres to the south.
It was a huge and simultaneously very delicate operation.
It was ridiculous because the transducer was 222 metres long, weighing about 6000 tons and had to reach a threshold of about 3 %.
Delicate, for access to both directions was limited to a few millimeters.
Congratulations, everyone has done well.
Simona Ballsa is getting gold for women.
Forget about it.
Forget the details.
Simon Bails doesn't worry about it.
The dynamic lens.
Without effort, he's carrying out his vingurts on the velvet.
It shall not be possible to operate on the floor.
It's completely innocent.
And finally also the Olympic Championship.
On the fourth day of the 19th year of his reign, the American vinedresser wore gold medals, showing a complete difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympics.
Her total number of points 62,198 was more than the result of the winning of the steel medal and of her team member, Alija Raismane and the winning of the winning of the bronze medal of the Russian athlete Alija Mustafin.
On Thursday, U.S. sportsman Simona Bails performed a vinguration for white sports for individual multi-final women in the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Riodejaneiro, Brazil.
Ballsa became a fourth American in order to gain the title of a multi-stakeholder championship and the fifth best winemaker, to reduce her reputation as the best winemaker in the history of her generation and possibly the best winemakers.
When the final result was announced, she was released in the summer, since the long journey to this warning was at the end.
This achievement draws them closer to the incompatibility athletes like Michaels Felps, who wrapped up their sports type at another level.
In the last three years, Ballsa has dominated his sport by acquiring 15 medals in world championships, including 10 gold medals, in performing such a great, accurate and ambitious combination of vineyards that in 1984 the Olympic champion Maria Lu Retone named him "the best winner she's ever seen".
In Brazil, she was subjected to a final test, where she had to cope with the hopes she had placed on her rather than with other athletes.
She would give her will if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas without gold medals.
American athletes Simona Bails (left) and Alija Raismane are discussing the effects of the respective gold and silver medals on individual women's finals in the Olympics in Riodejaneiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday, 2016.
The first gold medal, Balsa won the second day, making special election coordinators Marta Karolji's departure tickets.
Although Balsa claims that there has been no such thing on her long road to glory, it is not true.
Part of her presentation's free movement, which included her special acrobatic transition, was accompanied by Latin music that would greatly affect the street near the Rio Olympic Games Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl who adopted her parents when she was still a child and who was discovered by the trainer’s mother, Emija Bourman, on a trip to the sports center where the Burmese races took place has now become the force to be calculated.
She has not lost several matches since summer 2013 and the victory series can continue as long as Bails wants it.
Although Mustafin was little in control during two rotations, it was only illusion.
The same blue and free movement - part of the competition where Balsa will defend its champion title, is still just ahead.
She stood forward with a result of 15,433 on the balcony and strengthened her leadership with a result of 15,933 free movement
Raismane admired her mother - in - law as she looked forward to the results that were only formality and that she missed out on the happy summers when the dream she had ever recorded in her notes book was fulfilled.
The result of Raisman was a small absence for four years of old events when he shared his third place with Mustafin, but he lost his battle with bronze medals.
Recently, 22 years of age, the captain of the team, who is known as the American as "old man", was appointed as a trusted leader.
After supplying free motions, which caused him to doubt his return, he was able to devote himself to air pollution.
By the age of 19, Balssa’s official Twitter entry r, which she published this week, has already played a completely different role.
Six-year-old Mahaj Braun's "lost" survived an explosion in Philadelphia.
The police reported that six-year-old boy had been raped in Philadelphia, indicating that he was the second six-year-old who had been raped in Philadelphia this week.
The parents of the CBS Philatelfian news channel confirmed that this is Mahaj Brown.
The parents say that Brauns was beaten several times, including in the church, in the foot, in the hand, and in the liver, but he was still on the knees when he was taken to the hospital.
Her grandmother Delores Mendezza told her television: "His little body was just a mess."
I can't do it.
The child is in critical condition in the hospital and has already undergone several operations.
The family informs him that he will definitely return home.
He had to start attending the first class of the local school.
Braun is one of four people who were raped in part of the city of Germanton.
Three men were also raped: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
Channel CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, while the other two are stable.
The channel reports that the child was found in the front seat of the car nearly 29 years old in a critical condition.
The other two victims were not found in the car and the police were investigating whether any of them had been shot.
The investigator told the channel CBS Philadelphia that several witches were most likely involved.
In place of the event, the weapons are found by patrollings belonging to different weapons.
It looks like it's been a long-lasting shock.
The contents of the two corridors are located on the sides of the road.
"So it seems that there were several armed witches here who were actively involved in the attack," said Chief of the Philadelphia Police, Antony Ginaldi.
The damage is also done in several homes and cars.
No one has been detained yet and police are reported to check the records of surveillance cameras.
On the second day of the raid, a six - year - old girl was raped while she was playing in front of her house in the Westauklein area.
She's less likely to rest, but the police are still looking for the guilty.
Why do we need Simon, Gaby, and Laurie?
I call it the Year's Olympic Olympic Team for several reasons.
First, I've been on all summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Second, there are three lightlights in this team, Simon Bails, Gabija Duglas and Lauria Hernandez, which include many new girls.
People may be pleased that this team also consists of Elijah Raismane, who is Hebrew and Medison Kocia, who is a Catholic.
Finally, this team really represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
In the last four years, the best winemaker has been an American of African origin.
Last year Simon and Gabia took places 1 and 2.
These are impressive results.
In the past Olympic games, Gabia Duglas became an Olympic champion, and America was able to swim.
Now the world has seen incredible wineries performed by Simon Bails, Duglas and Laurie Hernandez in the three - fold world champions of Simon Bails, Duglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unpredictably but masterful wineries.
On the fourth day, Simon became a fourth American in order to obtain gold medals for individual women.
Her team member Alija Raismane got a steel medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can do, but in the rest of the country, the situation is completely different in winter hours.
Simon, Gabia and Laurie entered the Olympics together with Elijah and Medison.
She's the "Olympical Friday", because the next Olympic winemaking team will have only four athletes, and this is the trainer Marta Karola's last year in the coach's work.
Winning is really a great sport. Winningers are primarily practicing private lighthouse clubs, and they are cared for by parents who pay for trains, rooms, trips, trainers, hotels (trainers, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of this lighthouse club is located in urban areas that can allow this sport.
These clubs attract all their training, and it is a valuable and long contribution to easily accessible families.
Eimija Bürmana - Simona Bails trainer and Maggie Hainija - Lauria Hernandez trainer has trained their athletes since both girls began working with ease.
We need to provide new girls with more opportunities to train Simon, Gabija and Laurie.
I set up my lighthouse organization 20 years ago.
My organization is located in Harlem, and we offer more than 15 000 young people in the city (mainly black and Spanish origins) winemaking trains at a cost or at a low price. We have also trained national and international championships.
In September we will open a branch office in Detroit (in my hometown) to provide local young people with the opportunity to learn about this great sport.
It also taught hard work, discipline and progress towards the goal.
This combination ensures long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team will train thousands of new girls to practice easily and it's fantastic.
Working with this type of sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simona, Elijah, Gabia and Medison for the great " Girl's Strength" demonstration, by acquiring Olympic gold medals and by motivating countless new, different origins to become healthy, strong and successful new women.
Following Jeremiah’s rejection of Hannah’s offer, young doctors plan to avoid more stress.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute when they reached an agreement on changes in the agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association, but they rejected 58 per cent of the 37,000 new doctors who participated in the vote.
In July Hants announced plans to conclude a contract indicating that NHS is in a unstable state and that further delays will only harm workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes in working conditions during the night and at the end of the week in order to improve working conditions in non-standard working hours.
Last night, BMA’s new doctor, Dr. Elena Macourta, announced that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the contract offered, in particular that it will deepen the labour crisis and that it does not provide for all doctors equal conditions.
After eight weeks, until the first new doctor group will sign a new contract, progress must be made, as time is short.
The BMA's efforts to solve the problem through negotiations have coincided with the government's unwillingness to participate and sometimes with full silence.
This happened despite the fact that last month Jeremy Hunts said his door was always open.
Jeremy Hant has to act immediately, stop unemployment and cooperate with new doctors.
If he doesn't, the new doctors are ready for new protests.
At the end of the last strike, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were left, while nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had been given the ticket.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes in the agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association.
BMA would like to increase the rate of work per week at the end of 54 000 new doctors concerned with new contracts.
The NHS Executive Director, Daniel Mortimers, called on new doctors not to give in to stress.
Mr. Mortimer explains that the stress is not resolved but only increases pressure on the disabled and causes stress and anxiety to patients, caregivers and their families.
In the past two months we have spoken with the new medical committee and together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about vendors and rapporteurs.
The employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as job placement, flexible training, additional training for those who return after career interruptions, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, promotion of studies and gender in medicine - shows that employers, the health education institutions of England and the Ministry of Health are keen to implement agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
Medicines for 2 rats may reduce the risk of heart attack per day.
Thousands of patients with cardiac arrest could be treated with medicines for 2 days a day, as official representatives recommend that they be used for more people and longer periods of time.
Ticagrelor reduces repeated risk of heart attacks for people with heart disease.
This medicine has already been prescribed for use 12 months after heart strike, reducing repeated risk of heart attack.
The NHS representative recommends that this preparation be used for 4 years after heart rate to further reduce the risk of heart attack for people with heart and blood problems.
However, NHS is currently recommended to use this preparation for 4 years after heart rate to further reduce the risk of heart and blood vessels.
Each year some 140 000 people in England experience heart attacks, and a fourth of them experience repeated heart attacks or stroke.
Cardiac and insults cause tissue accumulation in the heart walls by creating defenses.
If a rash occurs, it can cause a thrombosis by blocking the blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
On the other hand, if the thromboembolism departs from the blood vessels, it can develop further into the bloodstream and block the access of the blood to the brain by causing the heart.
People who have had a heart attack are subject to the highest repeated risk of heart attack.
Ticagrelor produced by AstraZeneca, a British company named Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombosis.
The new NACE guidelines published today recommend 90 mg Ticagrelor for 12 months and another 3 years for 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
NICE Director of Health Technologies, Professor Kerola Longson, explains: "Despite the availability of medicines to prevent heart attack, more than a quarter of people who have had heart stroke experience another heart attack or stroke that often has serious consequences."
The fear of repeated heart attacks can have a negative impact on the quality of human life.
Evidence shows that Ticagrelor effectively reduces repeated heart and heart risk in humans who have already experienced it.
We are pleased to be able to extend treatment to thousands of people who are thus receiving treatment.
In the light of limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding, using this medicine for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend longer use of it over this period.
The policy-corrected culture promotes fraud in Muslim communities during the election
According to the management report, former city mayor of Tauerhamlets Lutfurs Rahman was dismissed from office in connection with corruption.
The government report reveals that as a result of a policy-corrected culture, eyes are focused on widespread corruption in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sers Erik Pikls criticises the police, the election will be watched and the city councils will ignore the sign of fraud in the process because "they are afraid to suppress ethnic and religious interests."
The former Community Secretary who has now become the leader of the anti-corruption organisation said that the intimidation of voters is so widespread for religious reasons that the police should be allowed to negotiate for election stations in order to protect the suspects.
He also suggested that voters should show evidence of persons when they vote in order to prove their true identity.
At present, voters must only have a name and address.
He even recommended that the voter be appointed with a special title to avoid double voting.
Reporters also need to provide greater protection, says Sers Eriks.
He believes that the press should provide greater access to Council documents and decisions adopted by the informal committees and working groups.
He said: "The aim is not only to prevent fraud but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and corruption culture that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was ordered by Daungstrita after the scandal in connection with the elections of the city of Tauerhamlet.
Last year's special election was decided by the court to withdraw the city's measure of Lutfur Rahman from the city's measure of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman 's "cinicly disturbed" his Muslim community's religious view and heard his criticisms, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman has led his election campaign on the basis that the religious duty of believing Muslims is to vote for him."
About 300 votes were false or questionable because one person had voted several times.
Also, Sers Eriks points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He pointed out that it is particularly disturbing to have to vote for a post where the older members of the Muslim community have forced others to vote for their own willing candidates.
Sers Eriks recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a document certifying persons to identify the identity of the person.
His report says: "The evidence shows that members of the vulnerable ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote for the most elected candidates of the community, particularly in the Bangladesh and Pakistan communities."
"There is a concern that the regional institutions are not paying attention to these problems because of political corrections, because they could undermine ethnic and religious interests."
Sers Eriks set out 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists working with votes cast by mail to prevent "voting".
The report by Tereza Meja also calls for a more careful check of registration to prevent the use of electoral lists for fraud in the area of immigration and benefits.
Consider the possibility before the vote to ask the voters to present a document proving the person's identity.
Mark the votes of the voter with a special title to prevent a double vote.
Check the nationality of persons systematically to ensure that the person is entitled to vote.
Set limits for three years for automatic mail voting requirements.
To prohibit political campaign participants and activists from working with votes delivered by post and election to vote by post.
Ensuring the police the power to take care of the polls.
Amendments to the Law to facilitate the designation of persons under the Human Rights Act of 1983.
Stop taking photos of the selection in the areas.
Set the selection requirement in English only (except in Welsh).
Strengthen the training to ensure that the voters go to the polls by one.
Sers Eriks is critical of the Metropolis police, noting that the Tauerhamlet case has not been brought to trial .
He says: "The love of justice has only discriminated against Luftur Rahman and his representatives for acts related to corruption and fraud."
He was convinced that he was guilty of a standard of criminal law based on undisputed evidence.
He also criticises the failure of the city council's "examination" voters in the registers.
Sers Eriks points out: "The court decision taken last year is a call for fear.
Our country is known as the birth of Parliament, but a disturbing and secretive election to spread fraud and the exclusion of institutions that fraud does not threaten this good reputation.
Riding with bikes - Other counterparts and other Rio Olympics
In 2016, Rio Olympic fans were reminded of the French biker Paulin Ferrand Prevot, whom fans recognized as extremely similar to Kembridge's hercogiene.
But at the age of 24, the biker was not the only athlete who fought in this summer for gold, which, like the media, resembles his well - known fellow.
So for the good Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently visible on our screens, FC has created a list of Olympic players, which is most similar to Hollywood stars.
Farmer and wolf: U.S. Army team of hunters Breidijs Elison, on the left, has been compared since childhood to Leonardo Di Caprio
Despite other colleagues on the track, many people on the Internet point out that this lodger could be a superstar Leonardo Di Caprio's twin brother.
A member of the U.S. Men's Locator team, Breidys Elisons, caused wind on the Twitter site when photographs were published where he was very similar to Volstrítas Wilka.
The sportsman also noticed wind in social media and recognized that he had been compared to Leonardo Di Caprio since childhood.
"I don't personally see a great look except the bar", Breidys tells about the expenditure on Huffington Post.
"He's a good guy, so I'll take it as a compliment."
This year, there will no doubt be an even greater popularity among the most popular London Olympics in 2012: the ambiguity between the British far-off Greek Ruterford and the popular actor Nilu Patrick Harisa.
Russian lighthouse Alija Mustafin, thanks to its large, expressive eyes, is compared with the American singer Gloria Estefan.
In terms of swimming, South Africa’s pilot Camerons van der Burgs has been compared for several years to the star "Showed to View" of Metjø Morson.

The same ancient compatriots are the Tennis star Rafael Nadals and actor Josh Hartnet, who have similar designs and paintings.
Russian silver medalist Julia Efimova and actress Annalina Maccorda may not only look like sun-burning skin and blonde hair. Only fans consider that American athlete Nathan Adrians is the only one who can compare himself to Joseph Gordon Levi.
Women with disabilities: The football star (left) Houpi Solo and the series "Deksters" actress Jennifer Karpenter (right) are similar faces and eyes.
Not one: someone Twitter user was delighted to realize that others also encounter these similarities
Theory: This user believes that there may be a reason why both look so similar
Recently a Twitter user reported with real joy that "the other Internet users are agreeing that Houpa Solo and Jennifer Karpentre are actually looking identical."
The U.S. football star and the Deksters series actress are so exactly the same face form and eyes.
Other popular comparisons are about the Kerio Volš Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the taste of Laura's Line. Also, gold medals were obtained by easy-to-read Gabija Duglas' beauty, a wide smile similar to "Bring It On" of the star Gabriela Union.
The CBC Olympic player apologizes for his comment that the Chinese footballer is 'complete as a pig'.
Baron Makdonalda's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhas's final 4x200 m free-style statuette in women, called the "CBC" star.
The Canadian Canal CBC was forced to apologize because one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese dancer from the game was "escaped from the game that he just died" and "will end up like a dog".
Commentary Byrons McDonalds thought his microphone was off when 4x200 m free-style staff women finally expressed their personal views.
McDonald, who was included in the CBC Commentary Team to give comments on life, said: "The little fourteen-year-old from China can't stay with her."
"He's gone too far, he's gone out of the game that he just died and ended up like a bitch."
Thank you very much.
At 14 years of age, the result of Chinese explorer Ai Yanhana was 1:57.79, which is 1.61 seconds lower than Canadian Taylor Ruck's result by allowing Canadians to reach China.
Readers throughout Canada responded immediately to the Internet because they were shocked to hear such tone and expressions.
Emets Makfarlains wrote on Twitter: "You just said that 14-year-old farmer from China "was finished like a pig?".??.
Idiot didn't realize they were still in the straight line.
Ai Yanha from China 4x200m free-style final women were named "a small forty-year-old from China who is not with her."
The criticism against Bahrain quickly came into force, as many asked for explanations.
Twitter users were unable to make any comments from Bairona Macdonalda.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote: "Ohh, #ByronMacDonald.
You're a representative of CBC and Canada and you and you, we're all listening to you like you are. #pretty.
Shortly after Scott Rasel, who was currently leading the CBC directly, apologized for McDonald's comments, saying: "We apologize that the comment on the landing result was rejected in the immediate room."
It was a failed choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
CBC apologized more than 90 people who had responded to this comment on Twitter.
McDonald's colleague Skotam Raselm came to apologize for his absence.
CBC then included more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and a statement.
We are very sorry that such comments were made and that they went directly into the room.
Last night we reacted immediately and apologized to all direct viewers and followers of social media.
For the sake of clarity, it should be said that the comments by Bairona were made about the delivery of the carrier, not addressed to him personally.
However, in any case they were not professionally and successfully selected and Baron was very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized in the immediate room and tried to explain that he did not think his comment would be taken as a personal attack.
In the CBC Olympic game, he said, "I would like to use the alert and apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's free style matches."
I was talking about the delivery of the pensioner, not about him personally.
It's hard to say I didn't mean to be rude, and I'm really sorry it happened.
Primark bought a shock on a woman who accidentally collapsed in the middle of a supermarket.
The buyers felt uncomfortable when the woman began to dress in order to get into the middle of the store.
When the situation got worse, she asked them to make sure they were there for her and then the village, leaving the bus back in the shop.
She continued to search for clothes at the Volkestone Bouverie Place shopping center at the store and held four more biscuits.
Primark shop Bouverie Place is a shopping center in Folkeston – a place where this woman held her pillow and then put it back in her hair.
At the same time, two children were found at the store, Jeannie Davidson, who says that an unknown woman was attracted to her dress and pastry store, not to buy anything.
She points out that humans were unable to happen to their own eyes.
In the middle of the store, she took off her shoe pockets, picked up her pockets, and kissed them, and went on to the place.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place to measure it, she simply held it on to the spot.
Everyone saw how his uncle's biscuits and apparently didn't like it because she just put it back in her hair.
She made three more biscuits until she decided that she didn’t like any of them and ran away from the store.
They did not think that he would hold them back from watching or thinking about a person who would buy the clothes he was wearing.
Young Davidson (33 years old) from Kent says: "The idea is that someone will buy clothes that someone else has bought and that are not lost after."
The incident occurred on the second afternoon.
Mrs Davidson adds: "I accept that business workers have removed these clothes from the business shoes - which are also acceptable."
I cannot imagine that I could buy a new one and know that another woman has held it and then it has not been lost.
The representative of the Primark indicated that Primark was known for the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
The specific clothes are removed from the business shoes.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves near a distance from the attackers with a gun, we spoke with Krav Mag Major of New York Ron Mizraki.
Regardless of whether you're missing from the front or the back, this video shows how to protect yourself and get an advantage over the attacker.
The suspect indicates that if an attacker breaks off the wall, it is first to be forced to see the attacker clearly and to avoid this trajectory.
Then the gun shall stand between its front hand and its back and make a seat in the face of the opponent with his free elegance.
Then follow the side of the road along the circle and before the attacker gets hurt, he has to take his gun, walk on his face with a gun back and walk away, continuing to turn the gun against him.
If an attacker is approaching from the front, the situation is similar - it must be avoided from this trajectory, it must be shot and it must be turned off so that the attacker can't escape.
At the same time, pressure on the weapon must be placed on the back of his chest and he must finally take his weapon and withdraw while continuing to cling to it.
Do you hear trouble?
Look at the video to see exactly how Mirraki does it.
But remember, if you're not a master of Krav Maga, then it's safer to give your money back to the rescuer.
The family of the bathroom is off the streets of the Saltaša Cornvola’s social home.
The water family has been expelled from the neighborhood for terroristizing neighbors by harming the social home of 50,000 pigs.
Tanja Skeldon and her partner, Sons Trebilkok, were expelled from the property in Saltaša Kornvolo, as they were charged with several complaints.
When they were forced to leave the property, the representatives of the shocked household service found that the property was completely demolized.
The walls and walls were paved with pipes, waste was excavated, and walls were covered with graphite.
The family is now evicted from property and most likely lives in a private property.
Donna Makevoja, managing director of the Cornvola House Service, says there is a concern that homes will not be able to be restored.
She says that the people who lived here were extremely difficult and felt that they could not live.
In this case, a number of factors need to be assessed, as this property will not have a good reputation in Cornvol.
This family is famous and its name is well - known.
The others were three children who regularly remained in custody and the police said that their terror was expressed as violence, street treatment with baseball bats, local people’s intimidation, drug use, drug trafficking and verbal abuse and restlessness.
47 years old Skeldon, whose name belonged to him, will be sentenced to antisocial behaviour in June.
Several demolition houses have found wastes.
In a home where previously marketed drugs are available, there are also several grades.
They say they've been on the street regularly and constantly being called the police.
The Cornvola Home Service released them from the pressure of their property when they were given 11 weeks to free them out of the house.
The missing neighbors were very happy about leaving because their lives had been absolute hell.
One said, "They didn't care about other people."
We lived with them for about 20 years, it's always been a joke.
I can't believe how often I've seen the police here.
We couldn't slow down.
We found out because there was so much noise here - we didn't know about it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be wonderful here.
Adam Fitzpatik, head of the Protection of Neighborhood of the Cornvola Home Service, said that the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family lived here for 20 years and here is called the police regularly.
In the growing garden of houses, various old and unused items were found.
He also said: "I am very sorry that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behavior, since leaving the house is always the last step taken by the Cornvola House Service."
This was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and their neighbors were very strict about their behavior.
I appreciated the work that all my team, Devonas and Cornvola police and members of the community have done in this case, who were brave and cooperated with us by providing us with the necessary information.
I hope that this event will facilitate the lives of neighbors and show that antisocial behavior is unacceptable.
Fitzpatris said that all three children lived here for different periods, but all were about 20 years old.
A clean matrice left on the floor in one of the rooms after the discharge.
Service personnel will now have to clean up the lost sheep left at home.
In 2014, the house was demolished by the police and recovered more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, assets and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon is only recognised as a criminal drug in the storage of Class B drugs for the purpose of distributing them.
She said that the money was meant for her son Lee Sheldon, who suffered from car accidents in 2013.
After the discharge, it is known that they are currently renting a private property in Plimut.
On many of the walls of the house, graphs were marked.
The police tell them they're going to continue to lay down the tenants who violate their leases.
The representative of the Devonas and Cornvolas Police, Angela Krova, points out that this isolation is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
He also said, "This is a warning to those who think they can act like they want and will not have any consequences."
Devonas and Cronvola police are not acceptable criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect the local communities.
The willingness to spend can give impetus to the economy.

The cannon measure shall be prohibited by the drilling of the pellets in the flatmala.
The city of Kannu, the southern coastal city of France, has been banned from selling plastic bags in this city’s platinum, which almost completely protects the woman’s body and is very much remembered by the local authorities on Thursday.
The cannon scale of David Linnars has signed an order that "accessibility to platoons and platitudes is prohibited for everyone who does not have a platoon that respects good practice and secularism" as the basic principle of the French Republic.
"Pludmal fever, which manifests itself externally during the religious presence when France and the places of culture are the target of terrorist attacks, may create a risk to public order (drinking, harassment, etc.) which is necessary to prevent it," said the Act.
"We are talking not about the ban on religious symbols in the platmal, but about external clothing that is linked to the faithful terrorist movements that war against us," explained the head of the municipal municipal service in Tyre Miguel.
He adds that the Burkini peldkostima in the Kannu Plains has not been seen since 28 July, when the good Central Party's "Republic" member Linars signed this order and it came into force.
This week, the water park in the city of Marseilles announced planned private measures for Muslim women who would wear burgins in their pockets, as the consensus on such measures was presented to both the best and the left-wing policy.
In France it is prohibited to wear the headgears of Muslim women who are face-to-face but are not prohibited from religious symbols or appropriate clothing.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed by a terrorist attack in the nearby town of Nica, where a group of Islamic States were held responsible.
On July 26, two attackers who had betrayed the trust of the Islamic State, brutalized the priests in the north of France.

The "Cubana" festival started in Lucassala.
On Thursday, 11 August, the evening in Lucassala was given a start for one of the last festivals of this summer - there will be "Cubana" until Sunday night.
On the first night, a group such as Enter Shikari from Britain, which was expected earlier, but without losing out on the program, American banks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from "The Prodigy" and others.
The next festival day's program also has some interesting words - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", Pan-Croat legend "Ramones" founder of Markijs Ramones with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with the Baltician Pan-Croak leader Sergei Mihaluk, popular Georgian actor and singer Vahtangs Kikabizze, Ukrainian "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and a series of others, but the full event programme can be viewed here.
This is the second year when the Cuban festival takes place in Latvia.
After this severe financial failure and serious losses, but it did not stop the drivers from re-examination - they added the title to the title, included a group of Latvians (on Friday night 19:15 on the "All Day Long" stage) and announced that the festival had now become "closer and gained local colouring with the symbols of Riga like hers and cats".
Whether these efforts will be justified or not is too much to be considered, because the festival just broke in, but, as Delfi Exclaide observed on the first night, at least the great efforts of people to attract did not come out and the number of visitors were similar to that of the spring.
The British Railway Team twice had a good Olympic record and won the press.
On Thursday, the British team twice improved the Olympic record and won a victory in the race for men.
The first Olympic record improved in qualification, but firstly, the competition improved it from new Germans.
At the end of the Sprint, the British team was joined by New Zealand, and the British withdrew the title of the Olympic record owners by leaving them with silver medals.
The final British team won 42,440 seconds, exceeding 0.102 seconds.
In the battle for the bronze French team, Australia was defeated.
It should be noted that the record has also been improved in the qualification of women's housing travel - the British team has improved the world record, which is now 4:13,260.
President who remained in the scene: Gustav Zemgala - 145.
On Friday, 12 August, around 145 years since the birth of the second Latvian President, Gustav Zemgal.
The Zemgals declared the State of Latvia, but the failure has been largely described by the first President of Latvia, Jan Chakste, and the last President of the pre-session, in the era of Karll Ulman.
None of our civil men have so much to defend democracy and justice as Zemgals, published by Gustav Zemgala ten years ago in his book Arnold Auzinš.
In his interview with the Portal "Delfi" Ausijnš points out that Zemgals is one of the rare high-level politicians who have had a sense of humor.
The others are so rigid, always very right.
He taught that it wasn't like it, it could be like Raymond Vylons.
"He was the one who was close to the people," said Auzn.
Today's politicians know stories badly, they refer to Karl Ulman as a good leader, but rarely does anyone know how negative he was.
The only person in the government sitting was General Balodis.
Even if he was mild and gentle in his imagination, he was, in nature, historical.
"Zemgal with its sense of humor and democracy leaves a direct negative impact," says Auzins.
Professor of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia at Aivars Stranga in the negotiations with "Delfi" agree with the Ausnia assessment of the land as a peaceful and well-known citizen.
He also notes that Zemgals has raised respect for minorities and has regularly called on the Jewish representatives to the President's city.
"It was not at that time an act of aggression, after the country's president Alberts Kviesis took over this tradition," says the historian.
He was such a deaf and appreciated person who had come to talk about becoming the president for a long time.
He didn't believe in it himself. He just didn't.
He also felt quite critical because he did not know the French language but felt that the President must understand it.
"The French language bases were both taught during the Presidency," Stranga explains.
The land did not allow him to speak again, and he did not even like it.
In fact, he is a very valuable person in the history of Latvia, already in the city of the President before his arrival - he was very asked for a notary.
Zemgals also led the famous Zemgal kaki Suvorova Street 3, where there was a treasurer and treasurer company, where the practical government will negotiate with the Latvian state.
He was always progressive.
He was not a great Ulman, but he was not publicly opposed.
"In private talks both times, it has been said that Ulman's actions are not really sympathetic to him," Stranga says.
He lived a peaceful life without any suspicion of lawlessness or corruption.
How do we remember Armageddon today?
I'm sorry, but for most of them, he only associated with some street in Riga.
He was an absolute democracy, seemed to be central.
"There were no major disruptions during her time, i.e. he could associate with such a real stable presidency," Stranga summarizes.
During the presidency of Gustava Zemgal from 1927 to 1930, Latvia's national visit to Sweden also took place, which at the time meant its full recognition in the neighbouring country and its inclusion in the North European democratic nation.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgals visited the country in Stockholm.
The visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second president of Latvia was born in 1871 but died forever in January 1939.
Simple ways to help children end up with breathing.
I often come face - to - face with the fact that the child’s smile, the presence of a nude, is viewed by his parents as something wrong and unusual.
When a child manifests his breath - we don't know how to react, Econet indicates psychologist Jekaterin Kesa.
The specialist encourages little conversation about these natural and human feelings - the dreams and dreams that each experience periodically.
Aggression - it's already a physical action directed against other people, and it usually shows up when we feel comfortable.
When we, adults, are spiritually tired, we usually know what is happening to us and how to end it.
We can say, push, hide, keep yourself, tell your friends or other neighbors about it, we can dream of crossing the couch, smoking cigarettes (it's not the best way to smell!), go in the shower, sit down with a chair on the table and do other things that we don't usually do.
We do not face our aggression against others because we know different ways to end these emotions.
Children who are exposed to ghosts do not understand what happens to them, how they are named, and how to live with them.
They can say, "Hey prom!", "You're deaf," "I don't care about you," "I'm not afraid of you" -- and very rarely when I can say, "I'm mad at you."
Children live in a poetic sense, they are completely right here, this time, they are spontaneous and really in expressing their feelings, and often they are in different emotions.
It is very important that parents do not prevent their children from expressing their feelings, including feelings, not being told about them, but rather helping the child.
Do relationships need to be maintained?
The last working day on which not all windows have happened as you would like or simply bad timing - there are so many reasons why I would like to be on the alert, on the day or even longer "stop" from all over the world.
Is it possible to break off relationships and little more?
Does this mean, though, that each of the partners is on their own?
In his opinion, the king is divided into different ages.
Janis (23) is short and nuclear: "In my view, if you have to wait for the relationship, then you are not with the real person".
Eduards (30) has recently discovered a scheme that may help.
If you feel that your partner is starting to get nervous about each smaller issue, then you are certain that it is a real time to study other fields of the forest to see if you are missing, or especially if you are not thinking or even wanting to see him again.
So the answer is - yes, keeping quiet can help save time and understand how important it is for you to be on the other side.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
I think it is important to keep relationships between each other on a daily basis, because if you spend time with people 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then the conflicts are inevitable.
It causes you to remember every single thing another does, and it begins to pass on to the nerves.
People start covering each other, especially if there's no more talk about what you've done in the day.
My personal experience is this, so I have not had relations for more than a few months.
If you ever think of yourself as being better than others - then why has this woman with whom you are together benefited someone who may think that you are not good enough and there are paradise fields behind the mountains?
Just thinking is a little gift already.
I don't, I don't.
"I am, so I don't judge those who don't." said Edmunds (46).
King (33) has a completely opposite view of them.
I'll let everyone have the right time to stay.
You can't see every moment, all the time, from morning till evening, looking at each other's eyes and looking for love that's inextricable.
Watch out!
There are so many things - friends, work, ballet.
It's all your time.
Of course, for a friend or a woman, however, if both are to maintain their balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live to the point of death.
It's and it's just it.
Mortíns (27) says: "It's hard to say - whether it's necessary or not, whether it's possible or not to take it slow, but one is clear - it's something that has to do with the end, something that's missing."
If this question arises, then it must be calculated that there will be a change in the near future - for the good or for the bad side, it will depend on itself.
I think as long as you're new and new, you need so much time, but when everything's going to be serious and the relationship goes into a whole other phase, then there can't be no talk about rest.
But you choose to live forever together!
"If you can't stop each other's company now and once again need a break, then what will be when you will be pensioners who comment on how boring cats die or fight for what the garden needs to be better protected in the day," explains Christap (19).
All of the Lord's names have been changed.
With its sensitive and sensitive personality, Rozentals first stimulated the interest of Latvian people in painting art.
"In this sense he was the first love of the Latvian people, which will remain forever," wrote Roman Suta, the oldest Latvian poet, Jani Rosental.
Also, in 2016, when discovering a large retrospective exhibition of the oldmaster at the restored Latvian National Art Museum in the main building, Rozentals is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but from 13 August it is available to visitors and will be available until 30 October.

In Syria, the Islamic State has killed 2000 civilians.
The Islamic National Guards of the Terrorist Group, fleeing from Menbija, Syrian Aleppo, attacked about 2,000 civilians who were used as a giant on Friday by the US-supported Kurds and Arab Alliance and Observers.

Collegiants refuse to apply for VID.
The Head of State Environment Service Inga Collegova decided to withdraw its candidate from the Office of the Director-General of State Income Service (VID), which was informed by the Agency by the Ministry of Finance.
The collegiate states that his candidacy has increased between the ruling coalition parties.
It seems that the real reasons for the debate are related to the political views, but more often, the invisible interests and they have no say in my assessment of my professional abilities.
"It is not acceptable to me," he said, "and I have already stressed that the head of the VID's office is the applicant.
In the case of its candidate being approved by the Government, it is clear that this would not be a convincing vote and would not allow it to work fully and implement the necessary changes to the VID, with all the support of the Government.
Without it, it would not be possible for a full-time job, Collegiants.
"I have rather stressed in public that I do not want to be politically independent, but my entire application process is now too political," the official explains.
"Thank you for your trust and support to me, it is an experience I value as a benefit," wrote the writer of Rezinezce-Ozolai.
On the third day, the unity showed that during the meeting with Collegiants, there were "substantial contradictions" between the applicant's explanations and the information available in the public register on the costs of the SIA Pallogs dividends, as the decisions of the Pallogs participants in the meetings are publicly available.
The current responsibility of the head of the VID is fulfilled by the Deputy Director-General of Dace Pelek.

Once home after a joint meeting, women have decided to leave the business under unexplained circumstances.
The police were immediately informed of the incident, which also resulted in a decision on the child’s next bed.
Riga's freedom has introduced all the recommendations of the UK regarding the Russian island project.
The Riga Voluntary Administration has introduced all of the five state control (VK) recommendations for the development of the project Infrastructure for the transfer of port activities on the Russian island of Russia from the implementation of the city centre, reported to the company Dana.lv portal.
The approval of the project is planned at the next meeting of the Riga Freedom Board.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the VC proposal by preparing the documentation necessary for the implementation of the recommendations, the Riga Freevost Management also conducted the legal and operational audit findings of the International Auditor Deloitte Riga Free Management and the recommendations made to improve the project management during the next phase of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the VC today.
Despite the fact that Riga's liberal administration does not agree with the VK's opinion on the usefulness of the implementation of the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the financing provider - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all the construction planned within the project is complete within the time-limits and the planned size.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, VK and the stakeholders, that the main objective of freedom is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all VC recommendations on project management and monitoring issues," says the director of the Russian island project Sanita Kaire.
The long-term action plan for monitoring and monitoring the project’s objective was complemented by the most important planned actions of the parties concerned and the time-limits for the necessary decisions, the definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, the planned monitoring instruments of the construction process, and the definition of the most important border points.
The approved action plan for achieving the project's objective by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the VC, is complemented by implementing monitoring activities, thereby strengthening the control of the deadlines of the other parties involved in the implementation of the project by the independence of Riga.
A project management plan has been developed for the development of project management and for the reduction of potential risks, by defining project management areas and by specifying the documents developed to ensure a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
A project management structure scheme is developed to enhance the project capacity, which reflects the structure, qualifications and functions of the project management team.
In order to improve the communication of Riga's voluntary management with the parties involved in the project, a plan of communication of the interested parties has been drawn up, in addition to those of the parties identified in the project's action plan, defining the principles, forms and periodicity of the project concerned for the successful completion of the project.
On the other hand, in order to improve control of the use of financial resources, the need for a contract of service or procurement will continue to be more detailed and legal.
Within the project, the Russian island has built a port infrastructure that is consistent with global standards - four new deep-water stations, railway routes and engineering communications.
The co-financed buildings of the Cohesion Fund have been completed and transferred to the operation at the end of the year in which they have already been established by reaching their funding savings of EUR 10.6 million.
Safety at airports has been strengthened in Slovakia due to threats.
Following the receipt of non-specific threats, Slovakia has strengthened security measures in several airports on Friday, announced by the Ministry of Home Affairs.
"In view of the risks, we have strengthened security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Košic," AFP informed the news agency on Friday by the representative of the Ministry of Home Affairs of Slovakia.

The meeting will discuss the impact of the British Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia is the EU Presidency by January.
German researchers are discussing the number of "Berlin's Wall" victims.
According to the new study, the number of casualties in the Communists in the South could be much higher than the abovementioned, but doubts about the number of actual victims remain undisputed.
According to data provided on the third day by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989 at the border with the west, and the most recent authorities of the Western Communists were gathering 1841 people who were trying to get out of their controlled territory.
The museum has been investigating border-related deaths for years and is constantly correcting the number of victims.
This year, 11 more deaths have been added to the list, including including a six-year-old son, who agreed to try to enter the family through the former Czech Republic and Hungary.
Among the new Berlin Wall victims are also council-martial desserts.
"The final amount of damage caused by the double evils of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," acknowledged the director of the museum, Alexandra Hildebrandte.
"Our task is to ensure that the heads of people who have suffered harm, trying to avoid the Communist-controlled state, are collected and not ignored," stressed Hildebrandtes in a report published.
However, other researchers have already questioned the number of new numbers.
"The number 1841 is unconfirmed", in an interview Süddeutsche Zeitung claims the history of the Free University of Berlin by expert Johann Statt.
He, along with other researchers at the Free University of Berlin, is currently reviewing possible cases of suspected death at the border and has so far been able to approve only 260 cases.
Previously, researchers have noted that only 138 people were killed by the Berlin Wall.
In the light of those people who have suffered, trying to escape the Baltic Sea or to enter the Middle East through the territory of neighbouring countries, the number of victims, according to the State, could reach about a thousand.
However, this is significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the number of victims could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also records all cases of suicide of the East German border guards, whether they were directly related to their service.
The museum also includes cases of death that are not directly related to violence.
"If older people from 70 to 80 years of age die from heart attacks after border control," he should be aware of the consequences of these "slowness limits", says Hildebrandte.
However, the State is convinced that it is necessary to make a distinction between the elderly who may have died as a result of their experience and those who have died from long-term waiting in the bus at the border.
Regardless of its victim's record, it is not easy because the Communist East Powers have not recorded such statistics and researchers have to file documents in different deleted archives, states the State.
However, the State Group has recently received new documents, and therefore it could come up with a new number of calculations in the near future.
LPF President Pone on Rio owes to the trainer's accreditation; this is a surprise.
In recent days, President Kaspars Pone Riodejaneiro of the Latvian Federation of Peleging (LPF), who has won a bad reputation in the Olympic Games, has won a trainer accreditation, but he is surprised to hear about it.
On the third day, a large informant came after the words of the German trainer Alón Ribakov, who revealed that the last time he decided to go to Riodejaneiro to Pone, while the trainer had to stay home.
The original list of passengers was approved by Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalnijš, trainers Jacubovskis and Dave Collins, as well as by President Pone of the Federation.
The Latvian Federation of Peldages applied for five members of the Olympic Games, and even before the departure, Aldon Vrubläevskis claimed that Germany will have and he is looking for tickets.
"However, apparently for objective reasons, he was not there," said Pone, saying that this did not affect the outcome of Ribakov.
At the request of the Federation, Uvja trainer agreed to help her.
Mr., who himself is a member of the LOK Executive Committee, has criticised the operation of the LOK by bringing blame on the Olympic Sport Supervisory Organisation.
In my view, it is not lawful for the LOK Executive Committee to approve five persons and not take any of them away.
"I don't know why there was no place for the Pedestrian Federation right now," Pone says that the work of the federations and their presidents has not been evaluated in society, remembering that the federation's presidents do not receive wages.
Pone also criticised Jacubovski himself, arguing that before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he appealed to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any athletes.
Mr. President could not tell why he was in Olympic games with trainer accreditation, which probably had to be entrusted to Jacubovski.
"I was asked as President of the Federation, but for some unknown reasons I received trainer accreditation and now I'm not here."
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available changed.
Until the last time I thought Germans would be there because I had no other information.
After the information available to the Agency LETA, a few days before the start of Ribakova, she had a conversation with Poni, and after her fiancé had a sharp eye, however, the LPF President himself showed that she had a daily conversation with a desire to start sportsmen before the start.
He recalled that LPF oversees five types of sports in the Olympic programme and that four of them also take place for children in Latvia.
The President of the Federation has shown that there are also important points of reference in Latvia and that he has talked about such programmes for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the Federation and said that in Latvia in 2018 the World Cup could be resolved.
Finding Riodejaneiro is not my vacation here, I work here, spend my time and try to implement the four-year programmes.
It'll take 600,000 lashes in the garage.
During the AS Latvian fishing resources renewal programme this week in Daugau to Mangalsala, there is a shortage of salmon and time-consumers, and this year it is planned to allocate over 600,000 once-a-year-old salmon and time-consuming fish stocks of the Bior Tomes and Doles Institute of Science.
LETA informed the Latvian authorities that fishing will continue in the coming months - each year the total of the Daugava basins is allocated to 6,300,000 different species of fish and capillaries.
In the spring of 2016 and early summer, lead and snow will be released in June - strong, July - summer summer, August and September - summer and summer.
The director of Latvian production, Maris Könickis, said that environmental concerns are one of the main pillars of sustainable development of the Latvian Group.
"Every activity in the conservation and propagation of fish resources is aimed at environmental friendly actions in close cooperation with the Office of the Scientific Institute, both by raising and entering fish stocks in the Daugava basin and by carrying out other activities," Könickis said.
This year, Daugava will be free of more than 600,000 once a year.
For the second year before entry, small fish are marked on the bottom.
Today, there are 25,000 batches of butter with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Each year, the composition of scientificly based species and the numerical size of Dauga and its base in waterstyles are subject to the release of fish and capillaries.
In accordance with the legislation of the Office, the pooling of fishing resources in Daugau and its waters shall be carried out on the basis of an expert on the loss of fishing resources resulting from the economic activity of Latvia and by giving a conclusion as to what compensation measures are to be taken to ensure the diversity of fishing resources.
On the other hand, the State Environment Service shall, on the basis of that expertise, decide on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual amount of Latvia's compensation is EUR 1,035,000 in the programme for the renewal of fishing resources.
In spring 2016, in cooperation with the company "We Fish" for the fifth year, 400 artificial fishing nets will be located in Daugau near Kabala and Ichkoli.
Co-operation with the company, in order to promote a natural physician, is in addition to Latvia's initiative under the programme for the renewal of fishing resources.
The deployment of artificial kidney legends in the aquatic environment is an important measure to promote the protection and development of fish resources in Dauga.
The Festival "Sansusian concert" is a field base, forest, circus.
Guli in the room, eating like a restaurant, walking along the streets and listening to the wanted camera music, enjoying a quiet nature, - such a combination offers an alternative camera music festival in Sansu, which has already been invited by the third summer to the new Akniste.
The festival will take place in Susai - no longer existing darkness - in the former desert plain, near forests and lakes.
On three days - from 12 to 14 August - five views can combine carefree nature and academic music with pleasure.
Here is a theatre and a contemporary circus, performance and installation.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest editions, will find new audiences in free and open environments without concerts.
The distance from the family to Riga is about 150 km, but to the soft face and light foot just a few minutes.
"Please don't look for a program because we've knowingly chosen not to publish it before, so that people don't take one particular measure or artist, because in Sassus the voice can only be heard by taking it all three days," urges the festival's founder and farmer, operbaritone Armand Silinš.
The festivals are held on Friday at 7:00 p.m. and the first concert is at 7:00 p.m.
Of course, on site there will be programmers with all the information.
Those who have to choose one day are recommended on the sixth day because it is most refreshing - from 9 a.m. to the next morning.
"The names of artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv", says Armand Siliņš.
In the colorful works of artists there are, for example, the cosmopolitan Eva Bindere, chellet Kristine Blaumane, the operaist Inga Kalna, clarinet Guntis Kuzma, trumpetist Janis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zariņš, quartet Quadra and RIX, and even a commercial acrobatte Grete Gross, which together with Latvian music Eureka Kiršfeld, Martin Zilbert and Actari Anci Strazdu have created a contemporary circus exhibition of the artist's inner battle.
New jobs have also been introduced for the festival.
It shows children "Kukanis", which, according to the story of F. Kafkas, was made up of the motivations of the Review of Oils Kozlovska and Jacob Nimanis, until the end of Armando Siline, the musicians and actors will participate in entomologist (cultitor) Ugis Peterán.
Oskar Herliņš has dedicated the first Stigtéte, while Anna Čirse - Koku's opera, performances whose main features in the Second Kalnozol regime with Katrina Neiburg's video projections and Andra Egliša's scenario will be three small bottles in three hectares in a wide circle.

Reids argue that if Clinton is elected to the office of President, he will appoint Garland as Judge of the Supreme Court .
The leader of the Senate Democrat Party Harijs Reids is convinced that if he becomes president, then he will appoint America Garland as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court .
The Party of the People's Republic of the Senate has blocked Garland's approval since March when President Obama appointed him.
Head of the Senate's majority, Mičs Makonnels, said that the next president would be elected to replace the current Supreme Court Judge Antonina Skaliu.
On Thursday at his conference, Reids announced that he was convinced that Clinton would choose Garland.
The representative of Reida later said that he had not personally talked about this subject with Clinton and that it was just speculation.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team did not want to "rescue the ship" with another choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal of the United States of Columbia.
Reids said that the Republicans who block the nomination of Garland are "the refugees" and act in the interests of Donald Trampa, a candidate for the President of the Republic Party.
He also said that Tramps was not suitable for the President's work.

Women will want to participate in this project because it is a great art work.
Models can send their photos electronically or in person at meetings in Los Angeles and New York.

Greenland Hajiv is the longest-lived pigeon - video view
Scientists claim that Greenland sharks are the most permanent of all muggers on our planet.
Haizivjes researcher Julius Nilsen says that the long-term record belongs to a mother who may be 272 to 512 years old and five meters long.
The French court rejects the requirement to engage in business in the jungle refugee camp.
The French court rejected the request of the Kale authorities to collect dozens of self-contained shops and restaurants in the jungle, where thousands of refugees live.
At the sitting of the Court of First Instance on Monday, the authorities indicated that the country should buy 72 self-contained shops where people in the territory of the country market different goods, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer refrigeration services, 50 cents (40p) and simple restaurants for some of the euro-created restaurants.
The Office of the Prefecture pointed out that these self-contained companies must be destroyed because they create a cheap economy and do not pay taxes, as well as create fire and sanitation risks.
The representatives of the human rights group explained to the court that these small enterprises are important because the food provided by the government and the support group does not ensure the need for shelters in which the number of owners continues to grow.
They also indicated that self-contained shops and restaurants often offer free bread and food to those who need it most.
The Court ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people who had created 72 self-contained shops, but it understood the concerns of Kale Prefect.
Justice Jans-France Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a more important role than simply providing food to people living in "extremely uncivilized conditions".
He pointed out that these places are peaceful places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places subject to the risk of confusion is the Jungle Book Kids, which provides more than 200 free meals on the day of meal, English and French, and provides advice on asylum issues for hundreds of minors who are not protected without adult guidance.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition for the protection of children.
A letter addressed to Guardian stated that the elimination of caffeine "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charity organisations "Help for Refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" reported that the number of refugees in the jungle has increased to 9000 people who have been the highest since the rapid influx of migrants.

The impressive performance of the British elections in the Rebija-7 series ended on Thursday when the state of Rio Fiji was convinced that they were being met with a result at Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji demonstrated masterclasses in the control of bombs, the play of bombs with legs, support game and brutal power game, putting gold - the first Olympic medal in its history of its existence.
Saquive brought valuable peace prizes - steel medals that were now the third medal of Great Britain. The British election can be successful in the first Olympic Rebija-7 tournament where they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A strong battle half-final, where the Box team was arrested by a result of 7:5 days in the first half of the day, may have played in the UK final.
But in any case, Fiji's election is now in its best form to win 15 men's team.
Although little we can believe, we know that peace for Britain could be the fact that at least one Britt won a gold medal. This is the chief coach of Fiji's choice Bens Raines - former English coach from Vimbledona.
For Britain, this was an exciting experience.
Eight years ago, under Rayen's leadership, they lost all games in the rebija-7 series in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
It's painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji suddenly began gambling by opening up the British forces’ methods for happiness.
Captain Tom Michel and his associates were like a collision with a number of buses on board and World Series champions were headed by 5:0 when the Ocean Colinisau won its first landing.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwa has also increased his balance by making a fall in the right direction.
The results were 12:0 and the British team had not even really hit the bomb.
Michela’s great strength did not allow the generous Leoni Nakarava to get three points, but it only had little effect on Fiji’s results.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jasa Veremallu won the fall in good direction, strengthening the victory over Britain to 17:0.
After the replay, Nakarava increased its weight even more and it had stayed more than a minute... at the end of the first half.
Vatemo Rawovovovou avoided some of the inactions of the British forces and crossed the line by getting points.
The landing provided a result of 29:0.
I thought Fiji was born to play rebija-7 games while the British were still teaching.
In fact, it's also true.
The British team made fundamental changes at the end of the video player line... full four minutes after the first half of the standards were good until Joshua Tuisova, after the fantastic team's win, gained some more points for the Fiji team.
Deam Norton was able to get points for the British team's good by making a fall on the left side and by bringing the result to 36:7, but the game was already lost, as soon as the South Seafarers fan sounded, approached the cards and played in the courts.
Fiji's life-threatening attitude cannot be overemphasized.
Mat Viliame made Fiji win even more sweeter with another fall at the end of the game.
By the end of the game, Fiji could start singing, but the British had only the ability to sit in the medicine after surgery.
On the first half of the day, Fiji won Japan with a score of 20:5, while the British were more than South Africa, where in a very fierce battle both teams were defeated and South Africans lost only for a few points.
On the first half of Kails Browns led the Box team, but on the second half of Dens Nortons crossed the line with great skill and delivered a bomb between the pillars by providing British victory.
Markus Vadson, brother of the British team's brother Antonija, at the end of the game, gave the team a victory and another strength medal.
The trainer's battle with cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heter Staning to win the air raids.
It'll be the most emotional gold medal in these pockets and it'll say a lot.
From the first to the last of the cancers, Helens Gloveres and Heteres Stanning’s gold ring had a special role in the path of Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there are only two athletes on board, she was guided by Robin Viljamsa's support that attracted her to the second Olympic gold medal to women, becoming the first women in the history of British sports that had such success.
She was no doubt dominated by his unprejudiced victory for the 39th time.
The two great athletes with a floored elegance squeezing over the surface of the water, are not fully aware of this triumph.
After each gold medal has been won, a team of the whole team is working hard to make sure that the athletes continue to improve their performance and the biggest contribution to their success by the trainer who had not yet known or experienced this day 30 months ago because he was diagnosed with cancer.
After he said it's gone as fast as it's shown.
I had an urinary tract, which is one of the things that can be operated and it happened.
If I didn't, it'd be spread throughout the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It doesn't change your vision much.
The virus was discovered in December 2013.
This three led to the possibility that Viljams could initiate the recovery procedure at the beginning of 2014 and reduce the duration of the suspension to a minimum if it can be said.
I needed income, so I had to get up quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital, and I walked over six feet [6.10 m] and even 15 feet [15 m] long, although the doctor said he would take some steps.
It all started.
Self - esteem is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After victory, the first thought was about Williams, who was very upset all morning and spoke more than usual.
Staninga, who has lived in the Royal Artillery alone in Afghanistan, said: "This was a very difficult week, but it means a lot to me."
It only confirms how much it means to us and how much Helen and Robin have worked.
The three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin we wouldn't have achieved anything, so thanks to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't imagine any better trainers or better trainers.
Helen Glovere and Heter Staning have not lost any of their lives for five years.
The pair will reach such a speed that no competition can compete with.
Even in the last 500 meters when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanings and Gloveres were too large.
We smell every smell.
Helena cried: "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is very important not to lose concentration.
We had a good start, but at the same time we did not have high hopes.
That day we didn't want to go through the records, but we just got a good shot and won the games and we did the same.
After a few years, you will rest to decide what to do next.
The next month will be the case of the explorer Steve Bashal of Glover and TV.
Wait, she just wants to enjoy the smell.
I didn't mean to say that these were my last game.
This would have been too much pressure.
In London, I needed about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very excited.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "It's amazing."
The unique opportunity to look at the fantastic architecture of the Los Angeles Central Library.
Learn more about the city's Central Library, as the company of the historians of the Southern California Architect works in conjunction with the book "The Los Angeles Central Library: Its Art and Architecture History" by Arnold Schwarcman and Steven J.
J. and Schwarcmans plan to discuss and show pictures of Bertram Gudhue in 1926, as well as the 1993 restoration and additions to the Hardija Holcman Feifera team.
The meeting will take place on August 21, from 14:00 to 16:00. Salle Moderne, Art Deco Divisitum at the Legal School (formerly Bullocks Wilshire), 3050 Wilshire Boulevard.
Visitors will be able to visit the central hall, exhibition rooms, catacombs and tea rooms.
Tickets must be bought in advance; SAH/SCC members $15; other $25.
The young and young of DTLA are experiencing home changes,
By marking the 90th anniversary of the Los Angeles Central Library - with what else? - as a new book!
The team leader of the VID will "be forward to the end".
Following her statement, Minister Márim Kučinskim (Green and Land Union) and Finance Minister Dana Reisniecei-Ozolai (Green and Land Union) are now "primarily important" to approve the Minister of Finance candidates in the office of the Head of the VID.
Rajevski believes that both Kučinski and Reisnice-Ozolai in this government are "the first major decision" which can affect them as a political future.
If it is now beginning to change the position of the head of the VID board candidate, it will have a negative impact on their mother-in-law.
The next week's session of the Cabinet of Ministers has included the question of the transfer of Collegiate Director-General VID to the office of Director-General of the Government.
Mr Reisnice-Ozola, Minister of Finance, addressed the head of the VID, after the departure of Inar Petersson from the administration of the service and when the call for the Director-General of VID ended with no results.
On Thursday, 11 August, VID's manager, Dace Peléka, joined the Latvian Radio interview - if she was offered to apply for the director's office, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance shall also later recognise that he does not look at any other candidates of the VID leader.
Raivis Dintars, Head of the National Union of the Saeimas Group, also acknowledges that NA continues to support the leadership of Collegiants.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing budget deficit could not be threatened by the creation of a government.
Before 12 July, the European Commission (EC) concluded that Spain and Portugal had not implemented sufficient measures to reduce the level of budget deficit to 3% of the total domestic product required by the euro area (ICP).
The calculations show that, despite the savings measures implemented, Portugal’s budget deficit was 4.4% of GDP at the end of last year, but in Spain – 5.1%.
However, the European Commission decided not to apply economic sanctions to both countries while setting fiscal targets for the near future.
One of the reasons why the EC has not yet imposed sanctions on these two countries has increased Euroscepticism in many European Union countries.
Additional sanctions would only increase such negative disturbances.
Critics also point out that the EC is not consistent in its decisions, from the start of agreeing on uniform rules and then unable to apply them in life.
For example, German Bundesbank President Jens Veidmanns pointed out that Europe is losing its confidence by creating the people's impression that the European Union's rules are recommended, not binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have agreed to extend the budget deficit deadline by the end of this year to Portugal and Spain by 2018.
The European Commission intends to examine progress achieved by both countries within the next few months, while indicating that both Spain and Portugal must be ready to introduce additional conservation measures if required by the circumstances.
The initial projections show that the targets set for Portugal could be achieved at a given time and that this year the budget deficit could be reduced to 2.5% of the total domestic product.
This means that within the framework of the Stability Programme, the Government of this country must implement conservation measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in the budget for this year, with additional attention being paid to the control of purchase costs of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complex.
This year's budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, this year up to 3.1% and 2018 up to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, the consolidation measures for the next two years must be 0.5% of GDP per year.
In particular, it would be difficult to achieve these objectives because for eight months the political parties of Spain have not agreed on the establishment of a government, and it is becoming even more likely that Spain can reach a third time of the year to conduct a preliminary parliamentary election.
However, public opinion discussions show that there would also be no significant change in the political side of the third election.
The most popular party is still the current Prime Minister, Mr. Mariano Rahoja, the leader of the nation party, whose vote would be 33% incomplete again.
Only socialists have increased their popularity a little while the popularity of the "Podemos" or "We Together" and "Ciudadanos" or "Citizens" have been slightly reduced.
The People's Party wishes to achieve socialist and "Ciudadanos" involvement in the government in this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit to the European Commission a draft budget for 2017 by mid-October.
As announced by the representative of the Parliamentary Group of the People's Party, Rafael Hernando, if the government is not established and Parliament's elections will also be held the third time, Spain will become the whole of Europe.
The purity of pludmals is critical in the waters of the Riga Sea.
Over the last five years, activists have concluded that, unfortunately, the number of losses found each year has increased, and here are the most condemned visitors to the countryside.
The most polluted places are in Riga.
In the capital’s view, it is difficult to fight against unclean visitors every day.
In addition, waste left in the dry ground during waste gas can be thrown into the water by causing serious damage to its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beaches and certain places in Kurzem, the cleanliness of the beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
Such a statement was made this week by the volunteers of the "My Sea" campaigns.
For five years, by measuring the road along the Riga Seabed, activists have concluded that the number of losses left by the population has increased by hundreds of meters.
Unfortunately, this year this critical assessment has taken place.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of wastes per square foot of 100 metres may even exceed 200 units," says Janis Ulme, representative of the expedition "My Sea".
Latvijas Radio called, he was found in Your Pladmala, where he continued his free journey along the river of the Riga Sea.
This year, between the various losses of life and the rest of the picnics, even the daily light bulbs left in the sands of the sea will be collected.
The transition participant and organizer Ulme said that the accused were directly affected by pollution.
"The main source is the visitors themselves, because more than half of the total waste is plastic, different waste starting with mixtures, plastic bags that are already at the breaking stage, they can no longer be identified, and flavors, bottles, baskets," says Ulme.
Among the cleanest beaches there is also a swimming pool in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgrí every hundred metres, nearly 800 waste units have been collected on average, which is critically high.
The organizers of the campaign also make it clear that every step on the road is also taken and not all signs of alert or ban are placed.
"The average figures for all three Riga landscapes together - Daugavgravrīv, Westbuljes and Parents - unfortunately are larger and far beyond the desired or the goal of reducing the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020," concludes the environmental representative.
Cleaning of places in Riga every day, in summer’s hot days even twice, the representative of the Council explains Ugis Midauskis.
However, the fight against unclean visitors is very difficult.
We're going back to these people's cultural issues.
"For those who want to use alcohol, smoke and do all things they can't, even special signs don't work," says Midauskis.
This is why Midauskis calls on the visitors to report on pollutants to the police as well.
You can call the police, make sure to refer to these violations and thus fight everyone.
Perhaps you can put some new warnings in place, but as I said, quite or as radically changing the situation.
"Since everyone should simply turn around and be indifferent to such offenders," he points out.
As long as water quality measurements have been carried out by the Health Inspection for the fourth time this evening, which may provide for a ban on official pasture sites.
Today, as in other years, water quality is always good and satisfying.
The present situation is that the quality of water in all 56 bathing areas has been good all the time and there is no restriction on bathing.
"For the last time, we will take an analysis at the end of August," said the senior environmental health inspector Normands Kadios.
The wastes left on land may be disposed of in water during solid waste gas.
This can, in turn, affect its quality, as indicated by an environmental expert.
Rotating in Russia will continue - change in the administration of Putin.
Pats is a lover?
Vladimir Putins announced to the Russian media that Sergey Ivanovs wanted to do this work himself and will continue to be the Special Representative of the President on matters of natural protection, ecology and transport.
When I announced the change, Putin's television camera gave Ivanov the famous words: "Sergey Borisovic, we've worked with you for many years together and we've done it successfully."
I am satisfied with how you fulfill your responsibilities.
I would like to remind you of our agreement not to use you in the office of the Head of Administration of this President for more than four years.
So I will wisely stand against your desire to change the field of action.
And I hope you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience in the new task.
However, it is noted that the management of the presidential administration is a very important task and has made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the upcoming elections of the State Council in Russia, the fear of this step is linked to the struggle for power in the political elite of Russia.
Ivanov was also referred to as a possible representative of Putin, so the claim that he himself wanted to take over the role of the President in matters of nature and transport raised doubts.
As indicated by the Lsm.lv archive, Ivanovs is the VDK and the Federal Security Service General Colonel.
Ivanov and Russian President Vladimir Putina were members.
He began his career as a specialist in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanovs became his deputy.
On the other hand, at the end of the reign of Russian President Boris Jelcina, he was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after the arrival of Putina, the "Information Security Doctrine" developed by Ivanova was approved, including the renewal of national censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergey Ivanov became Russia's Defence Minister, but in 2005 he was also Deputy Prime Minister Mihail Fradkova and was responsible for the development and export of arms by Russian defence companies.
Now, following the resignation of the head of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also remain in Russia's National Security Council, where the new head of the President's administration is now also working.
The blame comes from the family council party.
The President's board of directors of Vaino is recommending Ivanov himself.
I know Anton Eduardodovic and I already know him.
It's been since we worked in your government.
And in the last five years, we've been in virtually every day.
"So I am convinced that after all professional and personal qualities he is ready for this work," Ivanovs said.
The case came from a family belonging to the party elite of the council.
His father, Karls, took high positions in the Communist Party of Estonia, including his first secretary from ten years to 1988.
The Internet publication "Meduza" refers to the book "Igania's Self-determination and Independence" states that at the end of the 1980s Karls Vaino was asked to allow Moscow to use force against demonstrators.
However, he was denied and soon lost his job.
Soon thereafter Vaino moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from the Moscow International Relations Institute and manages the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the management of the President's Protocol.
It has already been reported that in recent weeks Russia has destroyed several senior military officers and even arrests, including the replacement of several district governors and federal representatives.
According to politology, President Vladimir Putins re-elected the governing elite before the elections to be held in 2018.
One of the main elements is the increasing number of representatives of the body of leadership.
He also dies a minor in Níkiforenko's losing Olympics in the first battle.
This was the first time the fight was, and the Latvian junta has ended his participation in the Olympic Games at the end of the 17th place.
Coach Olygs Baskins of Latvia's Television acknowledged that Níkiforenko's expectations were very low, and that was already clear before the competitions.
He also discovered that a young Jew had suffered a stroke during the war.
Of course, to get to the Olympic Road Marks, Níkiforenko came to start in another category of weight other than experience - i.e. weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The size of Azerbaijan was 25 miles [25 km] taller.
It has already been reported that in the Bordovko war, Juvgenijs weighed up to 100 kilograms against Ryunosuki for a period of two minutes until the opposite was granted a year of pure victory.
So far, the Jewish game of Latvia has been closed by Rio.
Dreams die in Rio's guts.
The fourth day was given by Jewish Jew Yevgenijs Bordovko.
Yes, he was even more hostile than he was, but he was able to overcome ambition at times.
He didn't say anything.
Arthur’s assignment in Žikiforenko was even more difficult because he had less experience and was also more respectful.
The result is similar, though, for half a minute on the roof he stayed more than Borodovko.
Unfortunately, in recent times, the Jews of Latvia have a direct lack of ambition.
Since the leadership of the Federation, Gunnars Xierson and his financial studio Vladimir Šestakovs have gone from Latvia to Aleksandr Jackevićs, no longer called "Golden Score" - the Jewish development rite by means of a leaking line.
Jackević, who here consults the Jews of Kazakhstan, and Vsevoldam Zelón doesn't see the men.
But if you don't, you won't.
And it's the federation's favorite.
Because of the fact that from another galaxy of the "Rita Panorama" the President of the Latvian Judo Federation promised Rio to break the medals.
The flight is far from reality.
In the evening, we looked forward to the playball game Samoilovs/Smédiņs - Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
Intriga as already in the "death" group - losers in the game are over.
Latvia's gift had a small break - it could also be lost, but not more than four points in two weeks.
The controversy was still on the horizon in the previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the wind-card fever all along the street.
For players, the violent wind caused further difficulties.
At first, I'd say that it could be ours - which is the most universal - publicized.
But it didn't.
It was quite simple to play here against the Latvian customs.
It's as good as Samuel and waiting for him to break up.
On the Canadian side, on the Kub side at the end of the first and on the third, because there was no charge.
In those days the carpenter could cook because the work was small, but when it was done, it was good.
The Brazilian Samoilovs with Shmedinju could have won two sets, because the first took over with 16:15, however, still on 16 others, also at the point of the loss of the limit.
But they could also lose with 0:2, because the second set of deficits was -4, however, thanks also to the governor, they managed to win.
The third has already been placed on the Evandr service mark.
The chain was created - an unconfirmed service, the second game rarely flew too close to the network and Samuel was left completely vulnerable to the resulting attack.
If there was a neighbor in the field against the Cubans, then this time he was more successful, and only His recent loss would not be professional.
Creel also made a mistake, and very symbolicly, that the last bomb hit him in the block.
He's losing his team.
At the same time, there was also a lack of success - only two Evans attacks almost flew out of the map in the third set, but the bomb still hit the line.
Two of them were next to the line.
The video of the controversial episodes is also decided for good opponents.
If Evandru had worked with the services in the first two games, it was very productive for us.
All total loss on the table.
The causes of failure should now be analysed in a peaceful manner.
It may have taken many people to live near the stadium, not with a delegation in the Olympics.
It's been a couple of hours on the road.
A series of seven semi-finals may have given little confidence.
Maybe you shouldn't have played in Klagenfurt, but you better get in here and get aclimatized.
It may have been a failure to find a sports platform.
We are waiting for more questions than answers.
Our lucky games are over.
The dream of the medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some of the World Cup tournaments and also the "Masters of the Sea".
The prophet Samuel had never been a friend, and there will be no one like him because there are too many different personalities.
But it's not necessary either.
When the dream of Olympic medals has been shattered, the thought of separation can also be found, because the blame will be sought not only in itself but also in the partner.
Divorce is not difficult, but much more difficult will be found in Latvia to find a decent partner.
The two brothers are playing the game, but John and Tom have already tried and got divorced, while Michael Samuels Samuel is still too green to start swallowing up the world’s tops.
You can try to go back to the Queen of Harald, Alexander Solove, Edgar Toc, but this will not be better than this option that has not just proved itself in the stages of the World Cup.
This time, they were not ridiculed by the Cubans.
A certain one.
Of course, it should also be taken into account that the pledmal volleyball is becoming more popular, it's becoming a new pair, and only the rare growth is less than two meters.
This still does not guarantee success, but there is an important argument in the fight for victory.
Our spirits don't stay.
For both athletes and journalists, it is possible to be moderate in the places offered by the players as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennisists are not staying in the Olympics.
Also, some of the beach volleyballlists have visited the hotel in Copenhagen.
This time, prices were severely overexploited for journalists for all reliable shelters.
This is why the choice is also based on the rent of the apartment.
The risk is because at times they may be uncomfortable from a logical point of view.
The risk is therefore justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovic we rent apartments on the Kopabana and Ipanema border.
Pludmale 200 meters away, a half-hour walk away from the arsenic.
The region is very safe because it is a favela but you must not lose your mind.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some think at once, but the most professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It appears that another metal dream was sounded on Friday morning.
Laura Ikunice-Admidinja is 100 metres away from her personal records.
But there are still five disciplines.
After 10 years of interruption, "Porgijs and Besa" takes place in Liepaya.
In Latvia, the first study of the "Porgijs and Besa" took place in 1973 in Latvia's National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognized headquarters has not been re-registered.
That is why the organizers of the Cés Art Festival and the Liepaja Art Forum decided in close cooperation to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy George Géršvin's chair.
"We are delighted that after a ten-year break, when Liepaja was finally able to enjoy the study of the opera, this great George Gäršvina "Porgijs and Besa" opera concert is a pleasure to us in the new, newly opened concert "Great Dintar"," says the concert director "Great Dintar" of the Bible.
The opera "Porgijs and Besa" is a story of love, its insatiableness, illusoryness, as well as the tragedies of life and the simple everyday pleasures.
It reflects African American vitality, music and rhythm.
The lack of this policy correction in this operation, this exclusion of tolerance makes it so alive.
"And you have to, this love story is extremely powerful, very beautiful and in some way really deep," says Director Viesturs Kairs.
What I like most - by listening or relaxing to this opera, there are always such touching points - famous melody, famous motives, but these transitions from one character to the other by lighting one person or another person, or the corridors or orchestras.
"It's the most exciting, this building," the opera evaluates the opera "Porgijs and Besa" musical director and director Andris Poga.
The visitors of the opera are convinced that this is a grandiose event.
They are delighted to hear the famous Christmas opera in this world.
It is commendable that in Libya, the spirit of the world can be just the spirit of the world.
"Completion professional", the operator reviews Edgars Láms.
The concert was special because the first time the orchestra was played by the orchestra at the new open concert "Great Dintar" in the orchestra, and the first time an opera concert was performed.
The garden at the Art Museum's renovated buildings could be named after Janya Rosental.
In the opening of the exhibition of the Rīga Vice-President Andris Ameriks Rosentala said that the museum's own address could be not in the future than the Christian Valdemar street 10a, but the New Rozental Field 1.
The director of the museum, Mara Láce, acknowledges that re-registering addresses will create a strong bureaucratic burden, but in general, this idea is welcome and has therefore been accepted by the municipality's proposal.
In 1936, the city of Riga was founded on this concept by creating the monument of Burkarda Jenna Janim Rosentalm, who stands at the museum.
The director of the museum at the time, Wilhelm Purvitis, was one of the first to build this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I've had a bad heart all the time - but Wilhelm Purvitis, where do we live his name?!!
"Bet, if you, Mr. America, promise to think," said Lace.
It is reported that the building of the National Museum of Art after extensive reconstruction and modernization was officially closed in May this year.
This will finally start the reconstruction of the VEF Cultural City.
The cities of about 11 million euros will be restored to the SIA "Velve".
It is planned to renovate several city rooms, including two viewers, as well as the building to adapt to people with mobility disorders.
The Riga Council has intended to attract the project to a total of EUR 6 million in the European Union's funds, but the Director of the Department of Specialities of the Riga Council of Directors of the Ministry of Finance Olyges Burovs recognises that there is still no complete clarity about the future of European funds for the project.
"In spite of the political desire to start the work of the VEF Culture pillar in connection with the European Structural Funds, it is, in months of waiting for a decision, real action by the heads of the Ministry of Finance, whether or not it will be granted or not," said Burovs.
Last December we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission to decide on its own decision not to take a decision here by Brussels.
Now we see that there is another round of discussion again, and then we will see what we can expect in the near future.
"I would like to point out that the Riga Council is undoubtedly guaranteeing that this process will be started and completed within the deadlines," Burovs says.
It has already been reported that more than a year before, in March 2015, the city of VEF Culture collectively conducted a leisure concert immediately before the expected renovation of the building.
Although last year, the renovation of the building had not yet been started and it had continued to function collectively under unimplemented conditions.
The Department of Specialities strategy of the Riga Council of Culture, the refurbishment of the city of VEF, seems to be divided into independent reconstruction works, where each will ensure the implementation of the functions of the city.
The first is to increase the availability of VEF Culture City and improve the area.
It is intended to build the environment and communication, as well as to restore the building’s façade.
The second is the improvement of VEF Culture City services.
It plans to improve the interior of the building, wall and ceiling restoration, view and sound records, as well as to arrange internal engineering communications.
Thirdly - Improving the working conditions of creative amateur collective work, which includes plans to improve work equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before "Livu" on the 40th anniversary, the legendary rock band can be seen at the exhibition in Liepaya.
The exhibition will look at various "Livus" features - photographs arranged on the time line to reflect the group's activities from the beginning to 2010, when the group's activities are announced to be completed.
There will also be exhibitions of viewers, musical instruments, awards and concerts, as well as other issues that have not yet been seen by the wider public which have reflected the activity of the "Live" group.
The exhibition will be supplemented by the items of the Liepaja Museum's warehouse.
The exhibition's visual formation became in cooperation with fashion artist and painter Elitu Patmalnieci.
The musicians who were associated with the "Live" group and their neighbors also called out and shared in both objects and memories.
"Livu" was first sought in 1972 when a vocal instrument assembly was set up in the Liepaja Cultural House, led by Juris Pavitols.
The Assembly participated in its original composition in the Festival "Liepājas Dintar" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in cities and republics.
In 1976 an illegal meeting took place when Juris Pavitól met with a group in the town of Erik Chigel and Metalturgu culture, calling for the accession of Ingrid Gutman, Andri Krzynji and Jani Groduma.
Over the years, the composition of the group has changed at least once.
The participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, most importantly - we want to prove that Latvian hand music is able to live and live - remains unchanged.
"Seeing no need - ginsots, bats and bardains, these children are emotionally separated from the stereotype of the generalized strategy heritage," says music viewer Class Vávere.
In the group without the above-mentioned music, such as Igo, Wilnis Rjevinš, Moderis Sterns, Valdis Störcks, Laimas Racenajs, Talis Pusbarneik, Ainars Virga, Avars Brize, Guntars Muceneek, Danis Virga, Thomas Klein and many others.
Entered into the exhibition without charge.
The exhibition shall be held from 19 August to 30 October.
On August 27th, the "Live" will be held at the "Live" concert "LIVFest 2" of the 40-year-old jubilee festival.

Zbigniew Stankevičs: The time is coming, and the truth is going up.
The Catholic Archbishop of Latvia's Metropolis Zbignævs Stankevičs in an interview with the Independent stressed that if we want to gain power in life, there must be a message from the Gospel in its center.
Because the power of truth is greater than the power of evil.
Many are already on their way to the Most Holy Virgin Mary’s celebration of the Lord’s Evening Meal in Aglono.
What messages will faithful ones receive this year?
In recent years the desire to take the lead in the ministry in Aglono has been expressed by the pope’s silence.
So, too, the main message is his message.
The tradition of your kind is also to consider the fact that John Bullis is the leader of the Krusta road.
He will also form his own message.
In the past day, I was conducting the sacred service of the Vigililian god.
Last year I will turn my attention to the French encyclical "Laudato si" and update it to a common house, the theme of the land in the context of Latvia.
This year... of course, I'm watching what's going on in the world, and I'm trying to react to it.
My approach to meeting the church recommended that the Gospel message be kept at the center of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel answers the most troubling problems in human life and gives him the motivation to go on.
Then it's talking to people.
But in Cesius, in the debate on Lampas, you say that "they return to the understanding of the whole human being".
What do you understand?
Does this mean that a person is excluded from the priesthood?
And does the church have such a means of returning today?
Men dying on the street in the capital city of India.
No one in the capital city of India has ever known anything about the deaths of men on the road - it appears that he was stuck on the road for an hour and then still drowned, reports BBC.
It has been reported that the man who was identified as Matibúl went to the market every day but worked for protection at night.
Matthew 5:30 a.m. went home on the way when they were hit by a light car.
The surveillance camera record shows that the driver is out of the car to look at the injured person and then walk away.
After an hour when no one knew of the bleeding man, he fell into a coma.
About 90 minutes after the quake, the police arrived and the injured man was taken to a hospital where he died from the trauma.
With reference to his candidate for the Office of the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID), Inga Koljegova, the Head of State Environment Service, has resigned the government from membership, the associate professor of the University of Latvia's Social Sciences College, Ojärs Skudra.
The colloquial explanation of the withdrawal of the candidate in connection with the dispute ruling coalition is bound by the fact that he has initiated a coup.
In the interview with the LETA agency, it was difficult for him to think that this week at the government's meeting "Oneness" would support the college's candidacy.
Accordingly, if the Ministers of Unity voted against, but Collegiants so well approved, this would lead to government democracies.
The expert also believes that before the notification of the withdrawal of the candidate, Collegiants have consulted both the finance minister Danu Reisnieci-Ozol and the Prime Minister Mári Kučinski.
At the same time, it is also a violation of the "Oneness" which strongly opposed its candidature.
By predicting whether it will appear with the help of tendering to find an appropriate candidate, Skudra recognises that there are two options - either a figure of compromise will be selected or the institutions as the director-general will continue to run in Dace Pelek.
At the same time, he points out - if the Minister of Finance has so far claimed that no other candidate has been considered, it is the house of Pelekaya that he cannot participate in the competition.
LATA has already stated that the Head of State Environment Service Collegova has decided to withdraw its candidate to the Office of the Director-General for VID.
Because of the "unity" opposition, the government left the approval of the College on the second day of the week at the Office of the Director-General of VID.
After the government's decision to give up the decision, Collegiants confirmed that they were still ready to become VID leaders.
However, the thought was later changed - on Friday, in a presentation by the Finance Minister to Dan Rezniece-Ozolai, she points out that she withdraws her consent to transfer to the VID director's office and does not have an easy choice for her.
Mr President, Mr Kučinska, Secretary of the Press, Mr Vaivars, explained to the LETA Agency that a new invitation will be made to the Office of the Deputy Director General of VID.
An accident occurred in the center of Riga involving a police car.
A road traffic accident involving a State police car occurred in the center of Riga this afternoon.
The police car with closed sound and light signals appeared on the top of the category, until the crossings of the Christian Barona and Djernav Road ended up with another car.
The police explain the circumstances, but the initial information shows that the second force does not release a long police car.
In the event of a woman's suffering.
The number of people living in Riga this year
At the beginning of this year, there were 638,784 people in Riga who were 0.34% less than in 2015, when the capital was officially registered as 641,000 people, the agency was informed by the Central Statistical Administration (CSP).
On the other hand, Latvia’s capital is located in 30th place between the European Union (EU)’s capitals and major cities with a population of more than one million.
According to data from the EU Statistical Office Eurostat, Riga is the largest female figure - Latvia's capital is the leading figure among Europe's largest cities with 127 women per 100 men.
All three capitals of the Baltic States are the largest women in Europe's largest cities: in Vienna they are 123, but in Tallinn 121 women are 100 men.
The warning icon will be placed at LNMM.
In the next few days at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM), warning signs will be placed - icons, LETA sent to the agency by the representative of the Department of Specialities of the Riga Council of the Department of Art (LNMM).
The improvement of the speed of the museum's glass damage has now been successfully achieved as a result of the activities of the shipyards.
In the near future, it will be placed with a warning pictogram.
They will tell the people that the fate may be quiet and snowtime, and that they must not be moved by cars, as well as by bicycles, textiles and textiles.
Ušakovs also wrote about this social network on Facebook, which indicated that no security threats were caused by damage, but "it seems unaccompanied" and scheduled "to be born".
Holidays for children and parents - Rīga are equipped with new children's rotary fields.
During this summer season, the municipality of Riga has even established two new rotary areas in the city, Cyprus and Chile, which are now available to children.
A wide, multifunctional rotal ship with various lifting elements, tulips, games, drums and slippers is installed in the chips.
Rotary garden is intended for all adult children.
The field also includes the elements of silencing and various balancing elements.
For small shipowners of the fantasy world, the location of the attraction on the Danube coast with a look at the passenger port and the sights of cruise ships.
On the other hand, in the field of wheels between the 4th and 5th crossings of the Chicurkalna, the boat, the path of the steps, the balance of the track, the wheels, the pumps and other game elements, as well as the winning area with the wheels of power and coordination training, the wheels and the sports elements.
The area is covered with rubber thread in different colors.
Up to the rotary field from the side of the road is a new, colorful bridge.
A reconstructed road phase has been opened in the woods.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the leadership of the State of Latvia (LVC) and the representatives of the building SIA "Binders" and the municipality opened today the national main road border of Russia (Grebnäva) -Räzekne-Daugavpils-Lietuvas border (Medumi) (A13) from Medumes to the border of Lithuania (156,4.163,05 km).
Roads are a national road map, especially border routes, so a particular delight is to discover a rebuilt stage at the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of improving the situation on national main roads thanks to the co-financing of the European Union funds.
"As forecasts show, the available means for roads will already be available in 2018, and we need to think about how to keep the most crowded roads in very good quality and also ensure the mobility of people in all regions of Latvia without funding from the European Union," highlighted Uldis Auglis.
The Minister of Transport also indicated that proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing for Latvia's roads will be presented to the Government in the near future.
During the construction phase from Meduma to the border of Lithuania (156,4.-163,05 km) SIA Binders began early and continued this year following technological interruption.
The cost of reconstruction is EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The reconstruction phase has completely restored the construction of the road and tomorrow's next phase will start repair work from Meduma to Daugavpilj itself until all roads from the border of Lithuania to Daugavpilj are set up," LVC President Janis Lange reported.
The main roads of the country are most crowded, and by 2018 we are planning to achieve that all national main roads are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, temporarily ensuring periodic maintenance and to make changes to asphalt over every 7-9 years.
"It will, of course, require adequate funding, and all passengers with hope of the proposals of the expert group for the establishment of the road financing system," Lange noted.
The project includes road connections and lighting at the Centre of Medumes.
Substantive land operations: four stages of recovery and extensive recovery and recovery have been compared with road garen profile, which has so far been very unequal.
Renewal of public transport facilities and newly built return to public transport.
In the past, there were insufficient capacity and areas of releifs were not transparent because of the mountain roads, as well as the old road common to releef.
In the next construction season, it is planned to renew the road stage from the city border of Daugavpils until now to the rebuilt stage (144,80-156,40 km).
This year the LVC plans to carry out various types of work more than 1100 kilometres of national road.
Information on all the repairs planned on the national road network this year is available on LVC’s website www.lvceli.lv.
"To achieve the desired weight reduction results, it is very important to choose the right combination of food products," admitted Lithuanian Dietologist Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
In addition, it is easy to enjoy summertime when our own gardens produce fresh fruits, eggs, and vegetables.
The combination of processed food products can help not only to reduce the remaining weight but also to contribute to different body processes.
Macaroni and etiquette are a successful combination because it provides long-term Satanic feelings and helps fight fat.
Studies published in the European Clinical Food Journal have shown that ethics has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us to be fair in our appearance.
The rich food of the cat’s peppers and whites, such as poultry meat or protein cocktails, causes not only the taste of salt but also a reduction in the meat’s legs after large meals in the next mealtimes.
The combination of such foods can also increase by up to 35% after meals.
Studies show that Caucasian peppers can help relieve fat flow in the liver.
Olu consists of a metabolic agent - Holin, while the paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
Taking sufficient amounts of this food may reduce cortisol levels, including fat storage around the body's average.
An egg’s excess powder, which has been added to fresh eggs, is another layer and fat-burning meal for breakfasts, which is worth including in their diet card.
The eggs and eggs contain solvents that, according to Canadian scientists, control the grain – appetite stimulated hormones – and thus also the sense of excretion.
In addition, the eggs contain polyphenols, which are supportive of weight reduction, and do not allow fat formation.
Plants and proteins are also able to perform miracles in weight reduction.
Such a combination can make Satan feel.
Plants contain water and liquids and thus contribute to Satan’s feeling.
At the same time, the protein slows down the bleeding process and gives Satan a long time to feel.
In the afternoon you can eat a sauce with salads or also prepare a protein cocktail from a ready mixture and enjoy it together with your favorite vegetables.
Avoid any combinations of products.
The fruit has cyccurides - monosharides or disacharides - one or two molecules.
On the other hand, the fortress located in gardens is a polysacharide.
Plants divide into the stomach mechanically, while chemically they do not divide until they reach a third or fourth degree in the fertilization process that occurs in the liver.
The wall is divided into three different stages that are already in the mouth.
It is therefore essential not to eat sweet food immediately after meals.
Eating sweet food immediately after meals, it's "extended" in the stomach together with other foods where it's not chemically cooked and starts eating.
Do not eat meat, potatoes, poultry, bananas, dates or other products containing carbohydrates together with lemons, vines, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
An enzyme ptialine found in cells only works in an environment that is contaminated.
Plant acids inhibit not only the accumulation of carbohydrates but also contribute to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, fats and meats, cheese and eggs or cheese or cheeses, meat and milk, oil and milk or rice and milk and similar protein combinations of rich products at once meals.
It is necessary to process them in different strains, each with different strengths, characteristics and time when they need to arrive at the nest.
Beef, honeymelon, muscle melons and other melons should always be eaten separately from other foods.
Melons shall not be digested if they are in the stomach together with other foodstuffs.
Fats in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats form a successful combination with hard, but they cannot be described as fats and protein substances - fats prevent protein accumulation.
The protein may be combined with a completely small amount of fat.
If a large number of protein-containing products are consumed, avoid all use of fat.
This also applies to freezing - it is not recommended to combine large amounts of rice (containing protein) with whole avocado (containing fat).
This combination prevents effective weight reduction.
How better to prepare?
"Preparation of food, thermal treatment causes significant food loss - approximately 15 to 55% of the original ingredients of the products," notes Dietology.
In most cases the food is lost by spilling food into the water.
However, the value of certain foodstuffs increased directly.
After gardening, it is recommended to use the remaining liquid for the preparation of soup - in this case you will not lose any nutrients left in the water and you will be able to drink it later.
It is recommended to prepare the vegetables, also to push them.
The thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of the lycopene contained in tomatoes.
When tomatoes are harvested for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
The thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of betakarotin found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, burcans, frozen potatoes and spinach.
The thermal treatment of eggs and meat removes the natural properties of the protein in them, making them easier to digest.
Treatment of meat and egg thermals also makes these products and other minerals more readily absorbed in the body.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products may reduce vitamin C by 10% to 90%, however, the freezing of solvent does not affect.
In combination with tomatoes, the iron intake can be increased in the body, which provides better brain and muscle function.
Our body takes up to 33% less non-inflammable iron, which is found in plant products such as bees, leaves, grass products, rather than blood-producing iron, which are found in animal national products such as beef, fish and veal.
You may significantly increase the absorption of non-inflammable iron into the body by using non-inflammable iron products with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and eggs.
vitamin C helps change non-instrumental iron so that our organism can absorb it more easily.
Iron is necessary for the production of haemoglobin, which ensures oxygen consumption in muscles and brains.
For the maximum benefit of salads, add them to healthy fats such as olive oil or flaxen oil.
When preparing skimming machines with lasers, add vitamin D to the rich rubber or sardines a safe yogurt that is a good source of calcium.
vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the liver and plays an important role in bone formation.
Auzas (as well as other herbal products) together with vitamin C sources such as soils, vines, sheep and other fruits or eggs help stabilize cholesterol levels and avoid arterial contamination.
Snapchat "Anime" effect in the criticism of Asian cariage
Snapchat representatives say this filter has inspired animation, but some commentators claim that it is racistly insensitive.
With this drop effect Snapchat allows 150 million users every day to change reality in an absurd way and play with their identity.
You can turn yourself into ananas, dog, or image that would fit into the Paradise of Liechtenstein.
The lens is a mythical, corrosive instrument that generates more than 30 million self-transformations per day.
Any error becomes public noticeable.
The effects of Snapchat leukemia have already been criticised by receiving transmissions that the application popularizes too black or light facial tone as an ideal beauty level.
This week, new leukemia effects were published, allowing users to create the eyes of the eye, the teeth of the teeth and the cheeks, and some critics called it a racist Asian character – “jelten’s comedy”.
The question was also raised whether such contradictions did not indicate that the company had greater problems with diversity.
The news and public negation occurred on the third day when The Verge and Motherboard reported that the effects of leukemia were withdrawn from the application.
The company explained that the aim of the legend is to depict the images of Anime, not to cariage people of Asian origin.
But for people who have experienced racism, these effects have been reminiscent of painful stereotypes.
Others categorized like Anime.
Korean American art student Greisas Sparapani Twitter entry for pictures has gained wide rationality. In an e-mail she points out that the effects are "inviting and not easy to say any more".
She adds that it is difficult not to notice the apparent similarity between Asian caricatures and the effects of lakes.
This shows that the effect of lightning is not just a yellow face but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has been established in these cultural sites.
The American culture is also involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion from the meeting rooms of companies to Hollywood and the devices we use every day.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people representing different races, unlike the older population, is more sensitive to such matters.
If Snapchat falls to create an image that calls users, then "Today such things don't go unnoticed" was said on Thursday at a 25-year-old Keitia Jou interview.
On Thursday, Zhou, the manager of the Media product company, destroyed his Snapchat application and recommended that others do the same.
In her letter "Midium" and in her phone interview she explained that she felt that there were problems with race due to Snapchat's employment policy, which does not support the diversity of race.
I criticised the company's management, which consists mainly of white men and then ended up writing with a reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there are no racial differences in the company, so such decisions are allowed. Or some other racial representatives are working in the company, but they do not take such an assignment in order to be safe and easy to express their views," says Chinese-American Joe.
She also felt that others agreed, while Snapchat did not answer her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many employees represent different races, indicating that it is a private undertaking.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of his employees, but his representative discovered that the company had become a staff specialist who would focus on representing also racial minorities who were not well represented and would promote inclusion in the company.
On the other hand, Juu will not update his Snapchat account by adding: "Amazing, do they really need more users like us to understand that it's not right?"
The Court of Congress announced that the military officials had changed reports on the State of Islam.
On the fourth day of the communication, the Congress Chamber notes that the representatives of the Central United States of America have changed reports, reflecting the war against Islam in Iraq and Syria much more optimistic than is the truth.
The analysis of the Central Command Service shall present a general non-compliance with the provisional report of the mission unit established by representatives of the Committee of the Armed Forces, the Committee of Inquiry and the Sub-Committee for the Financing of the Communities, indicating that their management controlled reports on American progress in the fight against Islam.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, which supervises U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest reports of this report indicate that the reports of the intelligence service, which were approved by senior military commanders Centcom, reflect the US's fight against terrorism more positively than is the case. The facts were regularly distorted, reflecting better achievements than other intelligence analysis.
The representative of the Republic of California said: "Centcom's action is unacceptable - our soldiers are those who suffer when our policy makers receive incorrect reports."
Centcom management errors are sought at the top management of the organisation.
This 10-page report is detailed in detail about existing problems in the reflection and analysis of the Central Union's efforts to prepare Iraq's forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although this does not provide irrefutable evidence that the senior officials of the Obama administration would have allowed reports to be reviewed, it shows that the Centcom administration has made a known pressure on analysts to reflect an optimistic view of the State of Islam (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report indicates that, in the first half of 2015, the Central Administration Press Releases, Statements and Reports represented the situation in a much more positive light than it was in fact.
For example, the representatives of Centcom publicly announced that the Mosula recovery operation could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosula is the second largest city in Iraq that is still under the control of the Islamic State.
In his report, the representative of the Kansas Party, Mike Pompeo, writes: "The investigation of more than a few months clearly confirms it."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the United States Central Administration’s main officials reviewed the reports, representing ISIS’s risks lower than they were in the truth.
The Republican Party set up a working group, acknowledging that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being distorted.
In order to continue its investigation, the report published on Thursday will follow new disclosures in this case.
The General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defence shall conduct an investigation into the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
The members of the Democratic Party of the Committee for the Management of Exquisite Management published their own report on Thursday, which they agree with the conclusions of the Working Group of the Republican Party.
In its report, the representative of the Democrats Adams B. Šifs wrote that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom was too limited to prepare the review reports on the ISIS and the Security Forces of Iraq.
Mr. Schifa explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information", undermined the analytical work ethics and "distributed the facts that were not in line with the truth."
But the members of the Shefs and Democrat Party add that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports according to "pre-defined or political position".
The Daily Beast published preliminary results of the congress investigation on Thursday.
In August The New York Times reported that the General Inspection of the Pentagon began an investigation after the centcom investigations.
The representative of the Pentagon, Lieutenant General Patrick Evans, said that the Pentagon would not comment on the report of the Congress until the investigation was continued.
He also adds that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defence and Investigation Management calls for constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not only about whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (the claim made by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's complaints are questioned whether President Obama can fully rely on the reports submitted by the Central Administration on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot points.
Critics of the Islamic State’s view of Islam remind us of more than ten years earlier when Centcom’s analyst Gregory Hükers published a study, claiming that George V. Bush’s administration started the Afghan war, thinking too little about its possible consequences.
Hüker also played an important role in opening up the question of the State of Islam.
Last year, the official representatives reported that the Hücker team had discovered that contrary to public reports, air raids on the Islamic State oil industry did not significantly improve the financial situation of terrorist grouping because they had built temporary factories to sell oil on the black market.
In the September issue, The Times reported that this discovery did not go beyond the central management walls.
In the meantime, Commander General Loids Ostins III received an ass criticism because many lawmakers considered war reports to be too positive.
In April General Ostins resigned and replaced General Joseph L. Votels.
In the United States with British women's field hockey, the United States will win a fourth victory by order.
The day after victory over Japan with a result 6:1, the fourth day Keitia Bama won the first two words of the U.S. women's field hockey team, when Americans won the Indian team with a result 3:0.
Five good things in two games are unforgettable achievement, but 27 - year - old Bama said that she could not remember what had happened to her.
She said, "I don't feel any pain."
I'm not one of those people who count their names.
But she knows that the American result in the Olympic games is 4:0, which gives them in their group no distinction with Britain, which will not be won on Thursday after victory over Japan with result 2:0.
Britain and the United States will be on Saturday to play the first round of the latest games.
The two teams have already qualified for the fourth and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the six teams and which one will be the second.
The first was soon to avoid meeting with the powerful Dutch elite, the leader of the second group.
Although it is not a six-day game, the Americans have already declared a surprise wind four years ago in London to take the last place between 12 teams.
In that command there was also Bama
Her husband in Bübbele, for the first time, accepted her husband’s hockey in his hands at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters had already worked with this type of sport in Dreksel) and joined the national election when she was 16 years old, becoming the most recent in the history of the players.
She wasn't at the 2008 Olympics because she didn't get to the end.
However, in 2012 she and her team were unsuccessful.
In the following year, English Kregs Parhams was appointed as a trainee and all changed to a good side.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical changes."
In London we didn't do as much work as we do now.
We've completely changed everything.
In the fourth day of the game, Bama discovered the result by picking up the first half of the game with a back-up girl from nearby distance.
India started the game without winning its account, but their choice was very strong and kept a minimum result 0:1 until the end of the third period when Bama again won the awards.
She put the bombers in the area on the left side of the field, then she noticed going to the middle of the field and popping up the bombers in front of the Americans at 2:0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melisa Gonzalez won another prize.
This was the first game of the U.S. Guard in the dry game of Jackie Brigas, each of the first three games to go through one gate.
She's stuck.
And so is Bama.
"We're going very well now," said Pahams, but how good, the game will appear on Saturday.
The most delicious food during the period of depression is "Sustainable meal"
In March 1933, shortly after the election of the president, Franklin Delano Rūzvelts sat in the oval room to stay in the dining room.
The President of Rūzvelt was greeted by such delicate culinary delicateities as the toothpaste or the mouth of Merland's bronchos.
But today his painting was much more accurate: an oyster filled with tomatoes, potatoes biosphere and desert - a flood bottle.
Jane Ziegelmane says, "It's a way to solidify food preparation with people who were very heavy."
Her husband, Andrew Kou, adds: "It's also a message to the Americans how to eat."
A couple from the Brooklyn Heights area are food historians.
The last book of the "Darzenos Sautjaj" describes the Chinese cuisine in America, but Ziegelmane describes the life of his book "97 Abels" through the food house in the eastern part of Manhattan.
Their new joint work "Satisfying meal" published by Harper on the second day is a story of American food during the Great Depression.
By showing known solidarity in the culinary, they held meals together with reporters " Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop" in a simple half-day restaurant located in the Flatron region and worked since 1929 when a major depression began.
At 54 years of age, Ms. Ziegelmanes ordered a buttermeal with dried cheese and dried olives, while 57 - year - old Kou ordered salads for papayas, potatoes and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a false sentence , the couple recognized that his choice was very appropriate for the discussion of the Great Depression meal .
Mrs. Ziegelmane told me that the fake dress was very popular.
There were groundnuts, livers and rabbits.
They were made of basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meals.
I thought what it was like to dig so many maps so that they could be in the middle of the day.
What kind of man's new?
"I'm sure I'm going to say that the liver is full of pigs," he added.
In the years leading up to pre-depression, half-days of the United States were similar to Swedish ships, especially in rural areas.
Women were ready to eat for their men workers and breakfasts, lunches and dinners.
During World War I, the Americans sent directly to Europeans. The "Separate Malt" described how Americans adapted to conditions when America was no longer a state of overcrowding.
"At that time the meal became the main object of the American people's attention every day," said Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write directly on this subject.
As important as new budget diets were: food such as fake dishes and snacks became daily, soaps were "a great way to use surpluses," noted Mrs. Ziegelmane, for the dangers could hide undesirable ingredients under harmful targets.
Fresh fruits were replaced by dried fruits.
The meat that had long been the main component of American cuisine has now become an extremely rare luxury price.
During the time when the number of calories and the food content was more important than the sound, the new generation, still unknown.
In an ancient manuscript, Mrs. Ziegelmanes chose recipes for making a full-fledged sip of ground butter.
"It was not a popular half-day table supplement."
Mrs. Ziegelmanen emphasizes: "It was real."
The groundnut butter and fruit juice are not compatible.
Many home meals were used in difficult times.
Thus, economic operators such as Luíze Stelli, head of the Federal Economics Office of the Economy from 1923 to 1943, determined state food supplies that had not been experienced before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing letters and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised households to become "economicists" and to accept challenges such as turning macaroni and burcanic mixture into spiritual food.
"Strengthening Maltíte" is a love of historical virtues.
It is particularly interesting to see evidence of the government's attitude towards its native citizens, for example, President Herbert Hüvera's "let me eat chicken" attitude.
Although he spoke publicly about his simple childhood and food in Ioo, he really ate like a little millionaire, which he had become.
What Mr. Kou says: "He liked European cuisine, for example, fish with cornmeal."
He ate almost in the crowded guest room eating half-day jackets.
He was completely absorbed in reality.
President Rūzvelt would have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to show an example of her eating habits.
The book says that Rūzvelts became a house servant who did not learn to prepare food, so that the Baltic Nam became a place "where not only one of the most expensive meals were delivered in Washington, but also the most expensive food prepared".
As soon as the national economy is recovered, most of the symptoms of depression are eliminated.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutrients, as well as to how science is used in culinary, Mrs Ziegelmanes added.
He relates that when he wrote the book, he gained a better understanding of Mrs. Ziegelman’s mother’s diet, such as why she could not eat outside.
"She was really afraid to miss out on a meal," said Mr. Kou.
Mrs. Ziegelmanen said, "She actually betrayed people."
Sometimes there was an incident with windshields.
When we were in Eisenberg's dining room, a couple of writers came out of the soma house prepared dessert: a bottle of flowers that President Rūzvelts wanted to eat on Wednesdays.
"It's a flood break," said Mrs. Ziegelmanes, adding that at the same time there was a distribution of income for suitable foods to give a short name.
It has no dirt, only dried streams, little flour, sugar, water and canal.
All were impatiently designed in the brown mass that was found on the solvents.
Surprisingly, it wasn't even that bad.
I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
After listening to the experienced "economicist," he said to the woman, "The gold of the collection of lashes."
Gilead will receive compensation for legal expenditure in the fight against Merck for Hepatitis C patent
The District Court has decided that "Gilead Sciences Inc." is entitled to receive back expenses for legal services which it has paid in respect of the patent of Hepatitis C against Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was justified in the case of 200 million mercenary fines for two Merck patents, which threatened it with successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when the U.S. federal judge found violations of Merk's operation, for example after the transfer of the animal and other inevitable activities.
On the fourth day of the proceedings, U.S. district judge Bets Labson Frimens stated that Gilead has the right to claim compensation for the legal expenses incurred by it in this case.
Merck tries to gain positions on the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with new birth hepatitis C drugs, which are effective 90% in cases of liver disease.
The case was initiated in 2013 when both Gilead and Merck appealed to each other, trying to gain ownership of the newly developed active components of sofosbuvir, which is the main component of Gilead medicine.
The US-supported forces claim that they have completely taken control of the city of Manbidja from the Islamic State.
The US-supported forces in their control are fully occupied in the northern part of Mandage City, along the Turkish border, and the last Islamic State military members of the city have disappeared on Friday, the group representative said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently opening up a city from the last enemy fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2,000 civilian civilians who have been defeated by the attackers, told the news agency Reuters that Charfan Darvišs from the SDS-based Manbage Military Council.
"The city is now in full control of us and we are looking for fighters," he informed the Agency Reuters.
Clinton's income reached $10.75 million in 2015, and the couple paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
Hilaria Clintone published a 2015 tax declaration, which shows that the candidate of the president of the Democratic Party and her husband have won $10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent, respectively.
During 2015, Clinton gave US$ 1 million, mainly to its Klinton charity. Former President Bill Clinton won about $5.3 million by standing as a sponsor and former Secretary of State received $3 million from his work book in the State Department, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's election was announced - US Secretary of State Tims Keins and his wife Anna Holtton published their tax declaration for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hilaria Klintone and Tims Keins continued to set new financial transparency standards," wrote Clinton's campaign partner Jennifer Palmieri in his statement.
On the other hand, Donalds Tramps hides behind a variety of beneficiaries and tenders in order not to comply with promises to disclose his tax information.
The publication of tax information paid is a practice of registration for US presidential candidates, but this is not required by law.
New York businessman Tramps and his attorneys have audited the State Revenue Service as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your passport," in his Twitter entry, Ians Sams sent information on the tax information of the Democratic Party's candidate for tax in Clinton's campaign partner.
On Thursday, Trampa Special Adviser Michael Kohens told CNN that he would not allow Trampa to publish tax information before the audit was completed.
The trampa critics, including the presidential candidate of the Republican Party of 2012, Ms Romnij and other Republicans, claim that their refusal raises questions about the amount of his real property, the amounts of donations and other business obligations of his party, including those of Russia.
Clinton joined the oil fire on Friday, publishing videos where several influential Republicans asked Trappo to publish their tax information.
She returned to Michigan on Thursday during the economic discussion on this issue.
She said to her efforts: "He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have done for decades."
Politicians reported that during 1990 Tramps had paid very little or no taxes for two years, and on Friday, the author of the New York Times business store reported that many journalists and jurists believe that nothing has changed.
The federal rate of taxation is an important issue for these presidential elections.
Clinton, in support of the proposal of billions of Varena Baffeta, popularizes the idea that every person who earns more than $1 million a year must pay tax at least 30 %.
This proposal is also supported by President Barak Obama.
Last week, during Clinton's stay in Omaha, Nebraska, where his "Berkshire Hataway" conglomerate was also located, Bafets called on Trappo to exchange tax declarations.
Bafets said he was also audited by the Revenue Service and Tramps was afraid of voters, not tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information up to 2007.
Klintoni now lives in the Czech Republic, New York and the period from 2007 to 2014 has paid an average federal tax rate of around 32 per cent and a total tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
Clinton’s 2015 tax report shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is paid.
Their main investment was the low cost index fund from which Clinton received $109,000 in dividends.

The director of the Hebrew film criticises hotels in Berlin about shutting down Israel's remote code on demand - RT News
The director of the Hebrew-born French film series was quoted in the social media when he discovered that the "Kempinski Bristol" hotel in Berlin does not have an Israeli remote guard code available. The hotel staff are based on the requirements of Arab customers.
Claude Lancmans, documentary film director of the Shoah Holocaust, did not hide his discontent with the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During the recent visit, Lancmans tried to find the Israel Remote Code in the hotel list offered.
However, this country was not included in the list with countries to which it can be called directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that Israel has been trapped and destroyed in Berlin, the new capital of Germany in 2016?
Written by Lancmans.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol hotel offers to call this country through its call center.
The director asked for an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancmans writes that the answer he received "was shocked."
The hotel administrator explained that "this is a known hotel management decision".
The reason for the withdrawal of the code was even more attractive to the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they asked for the removal of the Israeli code," Lancmans explained in another hotel worker's explanation.
Suddeutsche Zeitung reports that Israel's Ambassador Jakovs Hadas-Handelsman in Germany has been referred to as a "great dog".
We're surprised and shocked about this incident.
The same thing about yourself is great beauty.
And the fact that this has happened right in Germany, right on this hotel network is even more low.
No explanations are required.
"We hope that the hotel will make the right conclusions".
This event took place quite widely on the Internet, where people called it scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski hotel has just been issued to Arab customers.
Another entry sent "behave", indicating that the hotel is located in Kurfurstendam on the street near the synagogue.
The issue of Der Spiegel reports that the hotel itself quickly rejected all transfers by declaring that it was all "reconcilable" and apologized to Lancman.
"We have not received direct orders to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung, Kempinski, quoted.
And add that the code has been added to the list again.
The police use rubber and steel gas against protesting Brazilian students.
Student and police confrontation took place on Thursday in the city of Sanpaul, Brazil, where students took part in a demonstration against government education reform.
The police used rubber and steel gas against the students.
Problems began when lawyers tried to expel students as a result of the use of rubber and steel gas by the police.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to show their indifference to the reform of the education system.
Sanpaulu Governor Geraldo Alckmina's proposal is to close almost 100 public schools and 300 000 students will be transferred to other schools with a view to saving funds.
Some demonstrators marked on the wall a graph with letters against temporary President Michael Temer.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when the students in the hourly demonstrations were to give support to former President Dilmai Rosefia, who had voted in favour of the press.
Skots Kelums Skinner ends first, bringing to Britain gold medal riding
Kelums Skinner from Scotland finished the first team of men riding a bike at Rio veal which took place last night. The British team won the title of its championships it won in the 2012 London Games.
At the age of 23, a 23-year-old sportsman from Glasgow played an important role in these events by making a nice legendary scoundrel of Sir Kris Hoy and giving victory to the well-being of New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won a remarkable victory when Hoys won a fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they did it again at the World Championship in London, although Hoys had already finished his sports career.
Problems were at a stage between Beijing and London Olympics, as experienced beginner Jamie Stafu came to replace.
This was the last time they got it out.
When Hoys left, he tried to fill his place with Kianas Emmadi and Matt Krampton.
Britain’s coaches were hoping for Skinner, looking at the potential he later proved.
Hindus, Kenijs - champions who started four years ago with Hoju and Skinners who set up the Olympic Qualification Record, but the best start was for the New Zealand team
However, British trio obtained gold medals.
The Hindus, after their turn of life, were in a difficult situation, Kenys was in charge, and Skinner was in charge of this.
The change of the strategy played an important role in winning, as Hindus traveled with greater movement to allow Kenya and especially Skinner to move faster.
Hoys was seen as a BBC representative and cut off Skinner, Kenya and Hindi eyes at the time they climbed onto a good pastel.
The 23-year-old glaucoma said, "It was an unprejudiced promotion."
I do everything to protect my name.
We finally set up the Olympic record and won the World Championships.
That was just incredible.
There's no better victory.
After winning with Kenya and Hoju in the 2012 Olympic Games in London, Hindus admitted that they were on their way after a failed start.
Later he reviewed these comments and did not have the power to prove the opposite to British competitors.
There was no such difference at all.
Hindus said: "The British flag in the tribunals referred to London in memory."
Over the past three months, we have become a licensed team.
We have lost so many world champions, so the Olympics were really special.
One medal will be awarded to a country that won seven out of ten gold medals on bicycles in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is a team progress indicator over the last five months, the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of Kenya’s outcome, he could indeed resume Hoja’s success by acquiring three Olympic gold medals.
Kenya would mean six golden and one silver medal. Kenijs was born on March 23rd (it seems to be a British sacred date because this day has also been born by Steve Regreivs, Mo Farahs and Rogers Banisters).
This data also contains Hoys' birth.
Kenya's next series is a press that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
A 28-year-old sportsman from Bolton said: "Now I'm just trying it all.
The team's journey is always the best.
Because then you can win with team members.
If you're honest, then you're a little lonely."
He said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he'd have to be hired as a soldier."
That day it was the only war on medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sers Bradlys Vigins, Eds Klenseys, Steves Burks and Owens Douls showed the fastest qualification period in four kilometres.
His time was 3:51.943
The world record set up in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final will take place today on the second side of the day, where Vigins will certainly be at the center of attention.
Last night before his qualifying trip, he had had a disagreement with the Commissioner when the judges called him to measure his growth.
In the women's journey that will continue and conclude today, Laura Trota, Joanna Rovsela Shanda, Elinor Barker and Keitia Archibalda from Mingavia set up a new record 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British Riding Team, hopefully, will end up in the middle of the Olympic Games in the middle of the season.
Looking back on the outstanding and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone looks forward to the same achievements as Rio.
As soon as it has passed, after allegations of sexuality and respect, technical director Sheins Satons has resigned, and Hojs and Victoria Bendletona have also finished their career.
However, starting with the first train rides, it is clear that Britain will always reach the highest level in the real time.
The future of the Portland castle will become unclear as a contract has been terminated.
Aluminia castles and hundreds of its employees' future in Portland, Victoria has become unclear because its main client energy company has announced a cessation of cooperation.
This Communication is based on the Victorian Government's plans to stop the subsidisation of an energy company which is vital to enable the company to continue its work.
The 20-year subsidy will be suspended in November.
Thus, more than 2000 Alkoas Portland's workplaces are at risk.
The risks could be either direct or indirect jobs up to 2000.
In addition, it will also have unexpected side effects because it is consumed about 10 per cent of all of Victoria’s electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the “Point Henry” cabinet leading to an end to the operation of the English station.
The Alcoa Portland cashier works with losses and can be closed.
These events have led to several years of speculation about the value of Australian dollars and the cost of industrial production.
The supplier of industrial energy "AGL", which supplies energy from his "Loy Yang A" power station in Latroubes, says that the other three owners will probably also terminate their contracts.
Most power stations belong to Alcoa and Alumia Joint Undertaking, as well as parts of the company belong to Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubien Corp holding companies.
"AGL" hopes to continue the work of the Portland industry, which would mean further energy supply to the customer," its representative said.
‘AGL’ stated that contracts are so-called ‘risk-limiting contracts’ which are intended to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month period of validity and will therefore be valid until 2017.
"AGL" plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in the fiscal year 2017," said the company's representative.
From the year 2018 onwards, the potential impact of the fiscal year on profits will be limited to a favourable market forecast for electricity wholesale prices in the future.
‘AGL’ claims that in its forecasts losses have already been calculated at $187 million , assuming that these contracts will be terminated .
Alcoa submits that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue or supply energy to it.
The US company reported that it had concluded a Loy Yang contract for 20 years in 2010, but it will be terminated in November. The company does not provide any explanations on why it will cease its cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concern about the possible closure of the Portland castle in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago industry shortly from the New York sector due to the weak economy.
In the past week, Executive Director Stevens Mikelson said that 600 megawatts and 900 megawatts were used during the Portland year following analyses.
If both of these industries were driven from the energy market, the demand for energy would be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160,000 people every year.
More than 160 000 people are rejected each year, as well as budget cuts, the situation could worsen.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to combat illegal exploitation are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overrun, warns that reducing funding will only make the situation worse.
These legal centres will receive 30% less funding than they have so far since June.
Mr James Farels, Director of the Centre for Legal Affairs of Queensland, said that the latest report of the National Legal Centres Association reports that legal aid is currently being rejected by thousands of people in need.
Mr Farels pointed out that if this decision was not rejected, the situation would only get worse.
He also said: "The legal centre of Queensland is constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that the aid is rejected by thousands of people it needs."
People who are trying to end violent relationships, people with deep debt, families who experience divorce, workers who are unjustly fired - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the help they need.
Since June 2017, the federal government has reduced funding by 30%, which means that more than a thousand people in Queensland will have to solve their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney-General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to stop the reduction of funding immediately so that those who need legal assistance can obtain it.
Last year, the government opened its plans to make legal aid level up to the national average.
Now it is time to also pay attention to the needs of local communities and their clients and to the Palazzok Government to invest in this important area.
Donald Trampa's campaign was filed in court because one of the employees fired the gun
New York: Donalda Trampa campaign organizers have been charged with the court because they have not acted on the information that its North Carolin Operation Manager will shoot a gun at a worker when they arrived in one car in February.
This incident was described in a court order submitted by the Court of Charlotte on the third day by Vincent Bordi - former campaign programmer.
Boroni said he had waited months for an internal review of the case to be started, but understood that it would not happen.
Director ærls Philips "takes off his gun, puts his good showcase shop on the street and leads a stand against Vincent's road," Bordi claims in his complaint.
He also claimed that, by submitting complaints to the local and regional campaign management, Bordy knew that at least four people had experienced the same.
"The guns don't have to go out to cause losses," Bordy wrote in his complaint.
Only two days before the presentation of this case, a candidate from the Republican party to the presidential office caused scandal by informing people that "The People of the Second Amendment", i.e. the owners of arms and enthusiasts, would be able to act if the wish was to win his chance of Hilary Clinton and his chosen judges.
The representatives of the tramp campaign announced that the media had expressed their words from the context, and he never pushed anyone into violence.
Borons, on their request, would like to pay compensation from campaign organizers for ill-supervised monitoring, but from the Philippines - for the use of illegal weapons and the creation of emotional stress.
The representative of the trampa Houpa Hixa did not comment immediately.
You haven't been able to contact Philips.
WCCB - Charlotte’s local news agency reports that Philip has recently launched a campaign.
It has also not been able to contact his "Innovative Advisory Services" company.
The candidate for the presidential office of the Republican party Donald Tramps has implemented a controversial election campaign.

New tradition - Christmas and sports holidays in Čultije.
On the sixth day in July, the first day of the week, the crowd gathered for the festivals of the Passover and of sports.
After ten years of singing, it was decided that Ezra’s festival would no longer exist.
The new page is now split.
Day started with sports matches.
At the same time, the competition was not traditional and too serious to be taken because, for example, the shootings had to be done for a sleeping purpose, the flavor flew, with a man's left hand loss, "bumbleding" had not been in any Olympic games at all.
Yet, each participant was able to show how strong, courageous, and courageous he was.
After the sports games, all of the time was spent in a free-of-life strategy where Christmas celebrations began.
At the same time, "children's discipline" also worked, where small ones could get involved in the exciting attractions and get a new picture of the scene in the gymnasium.
A young person who could also become a tradition was a traveling merchant in which both tractors and motorcycles were given.
Inga Kadiče-Skadina, the head of the Külciema estate administration, spoke all about things that were fun and cool, but that was not very disturbing.
The festival continued with the greeting of the newest people in the world.
It's really good that the priest has added five girls and one girl.
With advances to the Italians, a more ambitious collective from Engures novada - viewers greatly liked the performances of the "Rudens rhythms", the performances of the "Reds" and the performances of the young dancers "Zelta Pearls".
And it's nothing that happened on the secret view of something else.
Of course, the local people and the villagers were delighted by the famous actor, Janis Jaráns and Danis Porgants, who was once again Mildinna Nabina and Clearite Kránina, as well as the attractive women of Barzciema from the fishing seat "Dienjas".
Balli played "Brugis" group.
Britain must maintain the Olympics and extend the Hitrova.
Not only will rapid prosperity and growth in the local regions and London but also throughout the country.
This, I think, makes Hítrov very attractive, just like in London in 2012, where we have worked hard to get all the regions from the Olympics.
Stratford and Eistenda gained a great deal from the Olympics.
And we will do this again by providing local residents and businesses with business opportunities from Hitrova.
For local communities only, we will create 10,000 new business opportunities, 40,000 new jobs, and finally add a point to young people's unemployment in the Hytrov area.
As in the 2012 London Olympic Games, there will also be people who will consider this challenge too big and that the expansion of the Highway is too serious.
On the other hand, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare Olympics during the time and that it would be a global catastrophe.
Skeptics failed in 2012 and will not be fair in the case of Hitrova.
There are always obstacles that must be overcome, but Hitrova has so far overcome everything.
Like the Olympic Games, Hytrova is a project of infrastructure that will benefit the entire society, not individual individuals.
The expansion is possible to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating soil for both employment and experience in this airport and throughout Britain.
A large team is working in an emergency, which has created an investment programme of 11 billion trucks worth of infrastructure, including in time and budget, starting with a terminal 5, which has been named five years from the site as the best airport in the world and finally with a terminal 2, which has been built between two most intensive flights in the world.
Now they are ready to set up a third-party flight, which will be financed by private investment in the amount of 16 billion cargoes.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am convinced that it will be the same for the rapid expansion of Hétrova.
It is time to revive the Olympic era and expand Hitrov by ensuring our future of trade and creating a new employment environment with which Britain could be pleased.
Lord Paul Deitons is a member of the Hitrovas government and former secretary of the Ministry of Economics.
In Switzerland, a woman will climb up a hill trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, he fell asleep on his knees.
The police tried to find Witnesses for the accident when four o’clock in the morning she was transferred across several cars.
The incident took place on Thursday afternoon after midnight on A1 road near Vo Canton of the city of Morges.
The Vo Canton Police report said that if she deliberately wanted to commit suicide, the woman was on her way into the dark of the road where she had been picked up by several cars.
Understandably, the victims, 49 - year - olds, gathered several machines, including a heavy machine.
She died at the scene.
Several cases involving these persons have already given evidence, but other interested parties have not yet been identified, says the police calling on the persons involved to call out witnesses of the accident.
The case also began a criminal investigation which, in this case, is a logical step, by the lawyer Gilles Hofstellers for the issue of Le Tribune de Geneva.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid the persecution?
Hofstellers says, "You're a noskaidros prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have occurred over the past five years show that none of the drivers will be called to account.
In both cases, the walker had gone through the middle of the night on the highway, so it was decided that car drivers could not expect to find a walker in the middle of the night, a message paper.
In the past year, a policeman was justified in notice after he visited a man who had been lying on A1’s way from Paijer in August 2014.
The court found that the 22 - year - old victim was drunk and later found himself stuck on the road.
The Court concluded that a police officer who was on his way to the scene of the accident was traveling in an appropriate manner and the judge recognized that the sleeping man on the road was "fully unexpected and extraordinary".
Any person who has information about the events of the fourth day is invited to contact the police by telephone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
The Internet collects signatures for the conduct of a new VID director.
Avaaz.org Portal of Petitions opened the collection of signatures for the conduct of the invitation to tender by the new State Revenue Service (VID).
An application addressed to the Ministers of the National Union (NA) and the Green and Landing Union (ZZS) indicates that the public wants a cross-border and professional process of exoneration of officials.
The petition was made on 10 August and is currently signed by 55 people.
The award process of Inga Collegiants, the Deputy Director General of VID, is indisputable and non-professional.
It recalls the best practices of the Council's staff of the Union.
It discredits public administration and, on a regular basis, makes society more popular in government and politics.
"There is a need for a tender with clear criteria for which all candidates should be assessed," the text of the petition.
His author, Janis B., pointed out that the public did not know the criteria for choosing Collegova for the task.
In addition, it is not clear what the candidate's intended VID is for work.
The request indicates that a new open invitation to tender for professional candidates is required for the State Chancellor and an appropriate remuneration is offered.
Last week, Minister of Finance Dana Reiznieces-Ozola officially appealed to the Head of the College of VID, and this week he was scheduled to be approved in the new office, but all the party ministers voted against, so the issue of the week was raised.
Samuel: If we lose, then I won the wrong.
Pludmal volleyballist Aleksandr Samouilovs and Janis Šmedijn were waiting for the prize of the Riodejaneiro Olympics, however, there was no difference where the competition was closed after the tournament ended Samoilovs.
One of the world’s most powerful paddleball volleyballs in the four-day subgroup tournament in the final and decisive game with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost the Brazilians Evandr Gonsalveša Oliveira and Pedro Solberg Salgada, completing their participation in the most important four-year sport forum.
Three teams of Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same was true of two others.
Three too small points were further counted, which was the best direct of Latvia's data after the loss of this scale.
"In the first set we were in charge, but from 16:15 it was also left to 16 points," recalled Smedian.
I don't even know how the rest of the set remains without points.
It must not be played.
After that, it was all right and at the end of the set to win the game, and it had to be a good foundation for the third set.
We started it the same way, but after we moved to the parts, the results grew for only one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup all teams were similar, almost all games had three sets, so small points were important.
"You should have played more like this, not multiplely give 3-4 points in order," said the athlete.
We knew Evandru could be observed.
"In the first seven to meet with it at the end, in the second sentence 1-2 points, but in the third at +4 he has already bought a game," Smedian recalled.
We tried to show the best game.
It's time. It's time. It's time.
The co-assessment situation was not seen before the match, but it was known that it needed as little as possible.
"If we lost, then I won evil," Samoilovs said.
From Evandr we expected a good service and with it at the end of the first set, but the third opened up a service and it was difficult to make an attack.
On the other hand, I took a lot of mistakes directly to the Pedru server, but it had to be done.
Samoilovs told me that the opposite was not the case for athletes today.
"We went, we played, we also had protection, but we needed better service," said the athlete.
"They played well and finally got to the Urea."
Before the tournament, we had just said that the explosion was not as easy as it could have been.
We were able to fight for the first place, but we didn't even go out of the group.
"All of us were waiting for medals, and so were we, but then there is no more difference - 25th place or fourth place," said Samuel, who predicted that the present would continue to play together in the future as well.
I think there will be no question and we will continue to play together because this is just one tournament.
Samoilova Riodejaneiro was already in his third Olympic career, since in Beijing in 2008, he started with Martinus Płavín, but four years ago he played with Ruslan Sorokinu in London.
This was the second beginning of the Olympics.
"Latvenergo" also follows the process of opening the gas market from a potential trader's position.
State energy company Latvenergo followed the process of opening the gas market from both consumer and potential trader positions, said company press secretary Ivita Bidere.
"The decision whether the future "Latvenergo" gas market will also be a trader will determine which gas market model and legal regulation will be established."
"We are therefore actively involved in the creation and commentation of legislation on our part, as well as in the submission of our proposals," said Bidere.
The Agency has already written that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (EM), in cooperation with the Commission for the Regulation of Public Services and the Energy Company "Latvijas Gase", has developed a draft regulation of the Ministry's Office on "Trade and Use of Natural Gas" which will change the principles of the functioning of the existing natural gas market from 3 April 2017 on ensuring that natural gas users are free to choose a natural gas dealer.
By working on a new natural gas market regulation, the EM aims to make the natural gas trade process as simpler and more user-friendly.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service solution is chosen as a "central model of the trader", in which all activities related to customer service are provided by a trader - one contract, one account and one information and one customer service place, by leaving technical issues of the natural gas distribution system for the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trade.
It is recalled that the opening up of a gradual market for household users - also after 3 April 2017 for those household users who will not choose another natural gas trader, will continue to receive natural gas at the regulated price of the current trader, thus becoming related users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas related users at a regulated price has been laid down for a public trader," the Ministry reported.
However, traders will have to choose a natural gas trader to conclude a natural gas trade contract.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trade agreement, the former natural gas trader will provide traders with a fixed price for certain periods of time.
The draft rules of the Ministerial Office detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules shall lay down arrangements for the supply and suspension of natural gas to users, the safe use requirements of the natural gas system, the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the natural gas owner's rights and obligations in the supply and use of natural gas; the arrangements to be made for the provision of services received, the percentage of delays, the trader's change arrangements and the supply of natural gas to users; and the procedure for the provision of natural gas related users by the public trader.

Minister: The next week it is planned to discuss an increase in the remuneration of the Director-General of VID.
Minister of Finance Dana Reiznice-Ozola (Green and Lands Union (ZZS)) plans to discuss the increase in the remuneration of the Director-General of State Revenue (VID) with Minister Mári Kučinski (ZZS) and the government coalition partners.
On Friday, Journalists said that the issue of increasing the pay of the Director-General for VID must be addressed urgently in order to make this task more attractive to the re-opportunity bidders.
Also, the next week we are talking about a change in the terms of the tender.
The Minister also stressed that she did not think of any specific candidate to plead for a holiday mission.
At the same time, Reiznice-Ozola expressed the view that the Head of State Environment Service Inga Kolígova would be a good VID Director-General.
On the other hand, with regard to the current VID leader Daci Peläko, who has expressed his willingness to object to this task, the Minister has repeatedly expressed the view that the new VID Director should be "see from the table" and should not come from the VID structure.
She also stressed that it is expected that Saeima will return from his leave to move as soon as possible to the amendments to the laws necessary for the reorganisation of the VID.

Collegiants also indicated that his candidature consultation has increased between the ruling coalition parties which are also unacceptable.
It has also been reported that the former Director General of VID Inar Petersson left office at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; more beer indexes in the United States and Europe, as well as the dollar value of the US.
Oil prices in the world continue to rise on Friday morning, with the positive impact of investors' savings on the Ministerial statements of South Arabia's Oil Affairs, which reinforce the hope that the largest oil-producing countries will take action at the upcoming OPEC meeting in September to stabilize the global oil market.
The three main U.S. beer index reached a record level that had not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and strong financial indicators for several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and the strong financial indicators of several companies were also a reason for the rise in the European beer index on Thursday.
The value of the US dollar increased on Thursday for the euro, for the British fleet and for Japan's yen.
In New York’s electronic market prices for the WTI brand oil supply increased by $1.78 U.S. to $43,49 per barrel on Thursday, September.
The "Brent" brand for the supply of crude oil prices in London in October increased by $1.99 - up to $46.04 per barrel.
The turnover of the "Green Lavender" of the conservative producer is only 33.8%.
The turnover of the Green Lawmaker was approximately €4.202 million, which is 33.8% less than years ago, while the company’s losses decreased 5.7 times - up to €904.7 thousand, according to the annual financial report published on the Lursoft database.
The company’s management report stated that in 2015 the company had been working on losses caused by several reasons, including the lack of sustainable means of circulation caused by the withdrawal of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market by interrupting the existing credit line and leaving the Green Law on contracts that had not been able to comply with them.
Therefore, the company did not have sufficient means to purchase cheaper raw materials in large quantities and receive a discount.
The creation of the relevant bank from the Latvian market also led the company to implement projects of support from the European Union Structural Funds that would allow the manufacturer to purchase new production equipment and modernise infrastructure.
In addition, the company’s financial producers had a negative impact on the rise in the price of raw materials during the marketing year and on the refusal of customers to pay more than the product produced by the company.
"Only on the second half of July 2016 did customers recognise price changes and were ready to buy goods for new – higher – prices," says the company’s management.
In 2015, the Green Lawn also started negotiations with potential investors, including the assessment of the company's foreign and non-exchangeable assets.
Investors have already been at the company’s largest creditor "Unicredit Leasing", where the parties have identified and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company’s activities and development had a positive impact on the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan itself includes improving technological processes and optimisation, which enables greater productivity and capacity to be achieved.
"A number of equipment has been purchased to ensure greater production speed," the company's management said.
The management of the "Green Law" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company to carry out orders that were not so far possible.
The first batch of production which will be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
Since the goods are already signed for sale of the product, all the products produced will be sold in accordance with the goods' protocols.
The new product will increase turnover by around 300 000 euros a month," the company's management said.
In August 2016 the company plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish production to Iraq.
In 2016, the Green Law has sent the first experimental container to Israel, expanding the market to Cyprus, and this year will sign a cooperation agreement with the new U.S. wholesale chain.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, Green Lawn worked with a turnover of EUR 6,347 million and losses of EUR 5,113 million.
"Green money" has been established in 1997 and its core capital is EUR 1,156 million.
The company belongs to two Latvian private persons - Mihal Kaidanova (89.11%) and Igoram Shirshoon (10.89%).
Steps were invited 15 to the museum to wait for the film show Záru Leanderi and to participate in the press conference.
Riga can be viewed as the city of the beginning of the zar Leander's career of the divine film.
The arrest of Záras Landeres at the Crustmat Ruth, who was a Swedish ambassador in Latvia, was evaluated in 1924, as she immediately revealed to the woman of Záras Leanderes an unusual low contract that she was trying to debate on the stage of the theatre in Riga in 1924.
Perhaps a feeling of unworthiness in Riga has become a legitimate passion for the world’s glory along the way of Sarah’s creation.
Riga Zárai Leandere was associated with warm memories, and she hoped to return to Riga in the neighborhoods, but unfortunately these hopes were not fulfilled because World War II began.
Using the form of the exhibition, this meeting will be possible at Riga's 2016 holidays and the great Ieva Kerévica will be in the role of Záras Leanderes.

The insurer shall pay compensation to passengers on the third day of departure from the airport.
If the insurance has paid a travel insurance fee to a family on Wednesday, a flight cancelled by Riga airport on August 10 which resulted in a refusal to visit the planned music festival.
On 11 August, an application for compensation was received from a customer in the If Insurance.
The family had planned to go to the music festival in Belgium, but since it was not possible on the third day because of air travel cancelled at the airport, the customer was expected to pay for a night-care reservation that could no longer be cancelled, as well as for tickets bought by the festival at EUR 204.
On the other hand, customers who have spent money on airplane tickets have promised to pay the airline.
If the insurance of all travel insurance benefits has averaged 15% of the cases, the compensation for the termination or cancellation of the journey has been paid.
"In such cases expenses are paid for the purchase, return or exchange of tickets, as well as for the reservation of accommodation," says Dagnia Rutka, director of the insurance product.
As we know, on August 10th, due to the technical problems at Riga Airport, the private aircraft stopped, so only a number of departures were cancelled, but several incoming flights were moved to other airports.
As a result of family repair, a man is forced to leave his house with broken ribs.
In the case of LTV "4studija" Dmitry Sidijaševs, who was close to starting capital repairs in his apartment, and since then Dmitria has suffered from severe anxiety and is not convinced that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors took part in the construction work and my apartment was damaged.
Then I informed the building government of Riga, household managers and other organizations.
The building government said we are not an operational service and we are not an expert.
"The owner of the apartment has to go to the Latvian Engineering Union, and there will be an expert from the owner," says Dmitry.
The invited expert came out, confirmed what had happened, and realized that the surplus was in a condition of dissatisfied.
However, since the first Dmitria proposal in the building, months have passed, and by the beginning of this week no one has been able to answer whether there is no risk to life in the apartment.
In the building house said - this is legislation, wait if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in order.
"Then I wrote to the Riga area, but they sent the house manager, then the house manager back to the building, and then there's a street," Dmitry said.
After all, it is clear that the construction work has been stopped, at any rate it can be heard that someone is working there.
In another two months an expert must be carried out and within six months the owner of the apartment who is doing repair work must avoid all these defects.
The independent expert has developed his opinion, but the building board considers it incomplete and superior.
The expert has not indicated whether there is damage to the metal regime in this adjacent construction, until it is not convinced that the owner of the lower apartment is at risk.
"That is why we have asked for further clarification from this expert," says Ilze Züka, representative of the city of Riga.
Despite the ban on any repair work in the upper apartment, the owner is still hearing that construction will continue.
The court for temporary construction without building permits is from 70 to 700 euros, but in particular the court may be stricter.
While the expert opinion is expected, the building government has decided that both apartments cannot be operated - both in the building and in the Dmitria apartment.
"This is not a case in the construction practice where, because of this lack of knowledge or simply unwillingness, the inhabitants may have caused a threat not only to their own property but also to the owner of the underlying property as a result of which the owner cannot exploit his property," said the building representative.
Now Dmitria is still looking for another place to live - with relatives, friends, hotels or rent other apartments.
But the losses caused by Dmitry can be managed by a neighbor's civil law, which can take a lot of time.
It is now prohibited to stay in both apartments because of the common construction, until the construction worker has completed his work and can wait even three weeks.
The losses caused will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment in which repair has taken place.
The owner of this apartment is also at risk of being detained for up to six months because of not taking into account what the building said.
Take it!
How much do I eat in this picture?
The expected answer is five.

Hakeri, who interviewed U.S. National Democratic Committee (DNC) computers, may have carried out several other cyber attacks, also denounced former NATO European Commander Philip Brydlova e-mail and the services of the "Open Society" of George Sorosa Institute on Thursday was sent by the Business News Agency "Bloomberg".
Hacker's information was published on "DCLeaks.com".
Among other things, the list and reports of the work of the Soros Institute are also included.
The Hakerem Institute's computers were available for a full year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same hackers associated with the Russian specialist, who violated DNA e-mails.
The Wall Street Journal, on the other hand, reports that the administration of U.S. President Baraka Obama is currently looking at the issue of establishing new sanctions for Russia in response to DNA leaking.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have an official cyberattack to the Democratic Party's servers to be accused of hackers supported by Russia or the Russian authorities.
According to the report, the website WikiLeaks published about 20,000 e-mails received from the DNC computer system and of which it is clear that the leaders of the Democratic Party have tried to harm party candidates Hilaria Clinton, former senior senator Vermont, Sonny Sandersa in the fight against democracies' nominations for the start of the presidential election.
As reported by U.S. press sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which conducts a survey of democracies, as well as other US specialists, believes that Russia’s commitment to cybercrime is certain.
Makartnij: The "The Beatles" was threatened by the presence of Joko Ono.
Paul Makartnijs acknowledged that Joko Ono's presence created a sense of the threat of the legendary group "The Beatles".
At 74 years of age, the roszwaigzna is currently enjoying "good" relations with the late John Lenona heritage, but while she was in the group when she was in the study, Makartniju was afraid because Ono was the only woman in the group - George Harrison, Ringo Star, Lenona and Makartnia - between.
When the singer asked about both relationships, he said to Rolling Stone magazine, "That's really good."
We're still at risk.
As we entered, she sat on the strengthening floor.
Most groups could not bear it.
We were able to do it, but not quite successfully because we were very upset.
We were not sexually active, but the girls usually didn’t come up with a record study, so she allowed us to work.
When John began to meet Joko, he did not sit in the control room, but both of us.
The author of the book Yellow Submarine also acknowledged that he now regularly contacted former group members Ringo and at any time approved the workplans of the "Apple" study, but otherwise "The Beatles" is "end of work".
The question is whether he still meets another member of the legendary rock group, Makartney said in Rolling Stone magazine: "Not at all."
We are involved in social activities and ballistics.
But at the meetings I don't go either way, I feel very limited about it.
I left Apple during a severe separation.
In my place at the meetings I sent to John Eestman and said, "Let me know what everyone says, because I can't bear sitting on his table."
It was too painful to see her pet die.
The company now works because I'll just listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus has ever been inhabited on the planet
Based on NASA's latest climate models, Venezuela has once lived on the planet.
Scientists at the NASA Godard Space Research Institute have developed models to study the history of Venezuela using tools and algorithms, which also use climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether the surface of Venus is hot, where there is no water and where the atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, which once had similar conditions on Earth.
Scientists have already mentioned that the slow pace of the evaporation of Venus is clear with the bloated atmosphere.
But recent simulations show that Venetian once had a plan, an atmosphere similar to that of the Earth, and it turned slowly.
The model also looks at Venezuela's oldest topography.
The planet had a more dry area than on Earth, but it had plenty of water and geographical diversity so that life could be created and water would not be taken away.
In early Venezuela, Saule was 30 percent more relaxed.
In the GISS model simulation, the Venetian heating model reveals that the light part of the day lasts for 2 months, the press religion explained to GISS scientist Antonijs Del Genio.
This process warms the planet’s surface and causes a case that, in turn, produces frequent tears of tears that act as a relief by protecting the planet from Saul’s wrath.
As a result, there is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually some degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model describes Veera's history, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypothesis.
Although it was once alive, for several billion years Venezuela had been subjected to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans were burned, and ultraviolet stars were burned.
When the water is completely depleted, the rest of the planet's carbon dioxide atmosphere is left with a deadly greenhouse gas - Venera, which we know today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venezuelan climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Rojs withdrew from "Avalanche" trainer's office
On Thursday, the coach of Colorado "Avalanche" and the vice-president of the hockey operation, Patrick Rojs, presented an explanation as to why there was insufficient impact on the team's decision-making process.
The vice-president of Colorado and general manager Joe Sakiks confirmed this information and informed that the club would immediately start looking for new trainers.
"For the past three years, I have been energetic, creative and objectively fulfilling my duties as the main coach and vice-president of the Kolorado club's hockey operation," says 50-year-old Paradise.
During this summer I've been thinking a lot about how I could improve the team's delivery to give it the necessary flexibility and achieve higher results.
To achieve this, the vice-president's vision of the main trainer and hockey operations must be fully aligned with the organisation's vision.
He should also be able to influence decisions relating to the provision of the team.
At present these conditions are not met.
The statement, which reached Paradise on 23 May 2013, thanked Roja for her contribution to her team.
The speaker said that Patrick had informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and want him to do the best he can.
In its first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Rojs was recognized as the best trainer in the league and received Jack Adams' prize.
He helped the club reach 112 points and the first place in Central Division, but in the first round of the closing game Colorado team won the Minesot hockeyist. Since then, the club has not been involved in the closing games for two years.
"Avalanche" concluded the 2015-2016 season with a result of 39-39-4 and left five points behind the "Wild" team without receiving a second special invitation from the organizers of the Western Conference.
In his career, Rajs graduated from four Stenly courses - two with Montreal "Canadiens" and two with "Avalanche".
North Sea oil platform workers start negotiations and leave the line
Staff strands on the remuneration of employees at the North Sea Oil Platforms have been suspended as both parties to the dispute have resumed negotiations with the Heads of Communication.
Periodically, the Wood Group works on North Sea oil platforms where the Royal Dutch Shell works.
The Joint Notice states that Wood Group and Unit and RMT agreed to resume the dispute settlement negotiations.
A number of full-day meetings are scheduled for the next week, starting at the beginning of next week with the aim of re-examination of the issue.
The companies reported that their recent measures, which have been organised after more than 25 years, are aimed at a 30 per cent reduction in the planned wages.
The negative market pressure of the Wood Group reduced wages to 9 per cent of North Sea workers this year.
In 2014, the company reduced the wages of land workers by 10 per cent.
The company explains that additional wage reductions would allow the company to survive market collapse.
On the other hand, Shell has already reduced wages for thousands of people and has announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries to optimise its work by preparing a large-scale merger with the British Energy Group.
Energy companies feel pressure due to rising oil prices, and the situation is increasingly difficult for the UK to make the decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, Scottish Parliament Member Devis Anderson met with staff representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - North Sea strike plans.
He said North Sea is vital to the economy of the region.
In his report he explained that the North Sea and the country in general need the economy from which all are benefited, not individuals.
In 2016, the new North Sea projects are intended to invest nearly $1.4 billion compared to $7 billion invested in the last five years.
Keplers measured the speed of the star movement in Plejades.
The most recent Kepler telescope mission has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of the speed of constellations in the Pleiades.
New data helps astronomers to understand why stars are at different speeds of this star, as well as how the speed of rotation of stars is related to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will obtain more information on the link between the weight of stars, age and even the history of their solar system," told the release of the Pasadenas Caltech Infrasarkan Process and the Analytical Centre scientist Luisa Rebula.
The star of the Flood is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars on this planet are only beginning to grow at about 125 million years of age.
They shall be speeded at maximum speed.
With maximum speed, these rising stars emit a large amount of star air.
When the stars enter the magnetic field, they're breaking the stars.
As the stars get older, their rotation rate decreases.
Keplers measure the speed of rotation of each star by setting the time between the known area of stars such as the sun's plane.
The most recent constellation speed catalogue shows that larger stars are slower than smaller stars.
Rebul compares stars with dancers, larger growers make pirates less than small growth dancers.
Rebuls tells us that the Pleiades "ballet" shows that the slow moving objects are larger and larger, while the faster the rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to the proximity of the Pleiades star, it serves as a great space laboratory that can compare the characteristics of stars with the speed of rotation.
Rebuls says that the Pleiades star helps to create theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions to both older and younger stars.
We still have much to learn about when and why the speed of the rising stars and about their complete stopping process will be slowed down.
The Rebuls and his colleagues detailed the analysis of the speed of the Pleiades stars in three new publications that will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
