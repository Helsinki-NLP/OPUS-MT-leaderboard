It's very famous, but it's an English contradiction that taught under the honour of Modern Education and the King, claiming that he had 9,000 students at the top of his career.
In his writings, he used words that some parents consider to be coopy and says he's been using sex in school.
Modern education accuses him of making a lot of praise in buses without permission, saying he's the main teacher in English.
He was also accused of violating original rights, but he was not charged.
The former student said, "He used a lecture in school, taught time skills by making notes and keeping himself like his students' friends."
Although China has been officially a Communist government for the last three decades, it has developed a market economy.
The first economic changes were made during the rule of Deng Siaoping.
Since then, China's economy has grown 90 times.
For the first time last year, China has declared more cars than Germany and moved from the United States as the largest market for this auto industry.
In two decades, China's HNA can be bigger than the United States.

Portugal, located about 3,000 million miles away from the city of Miami, Florida, has a maximum of 40 million miles per hour (64 km / h).
Scientists at the National Center of Potters predict that by Thursday, Daniellellen will be forced to become a Potter.
Because it's far from stealing, it's still hard to appreciate the possible effect on the United States or the Caribbean islands.
Bobek, born in the capital city of Zabarbeb, Croatia, took the lead in playing in Belgrade's Parizena.
He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.
During his time with the team, he spent 403 dollars in 468 lectures.
No one had ever played more than Bobek for Akbub or became more famous.

People hit windows through windows, but the windows didn't break.
One of them finally broke up, and they started going out through the window," said Francis Coal, a survivor.
Goddess release light and heat from the explosion of water atoms (or coagulation) due to the energy produced together by making it more difficult.
Scientists are working to create a reactor that can get energy in the same way.
This, however, is a very difficult problem, and it will last for years until we see how useful combination reactors are built.
The pulpathea strains the face of the water because of the gravity of the mackerel.
The complexity of the climate is due to the fact that water molecules on the surface of the water are much faster than air molecules above them.
Water molecules are built on an invisible layer of cold water that allows such things as salt to flow across the water.
The modern nocturnal beads for the structure have a double edge, between which there is a corrosive hole, and both sides allow it to handle better than the structure, even when it's being repaired.
Because the bottom of the table is a small hole, because the side of the table is covered by this or that side of the table, and the area connected to the building is also corroding.
It's going to force the left-hand side to turn around. If the left-hand side is right-hand side, the left-hand side is right-hand side-side, and if the left-hand side is left-hand side-side, the left-hand side is left-hand side-side.
To return to their previous energy level, they need to be freed from the extra energy they've received from the light.
They do this by removing the smallest part of the light called photo.
Scientists call this process a "dark outlet" because atoms flow from forest light by putting light on the outside of the photo, and light is a type of lighting.
The next picture shows how atoms extract photos. Of course, photons are much smaller than those in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the substance from which the atom is formed.
After working for several hours, the lamp finally burns and the lamp doesn't work.
And then you have to change the electric lamp.
First, you need to turn off the lighthouse switch or turn off the ball.
It's because the electricity of the wire input, where the metal part of the lamp is strengthened, can become a powerful electric shock if you hit the inside of the tube or the metal base of the lamp while it's still in the other part.
The most important organ in the heart system is the heart that moves blood out.
The blood goes from the heart through what's called fluids and goes back with what's called heart cells.
The teeth of the triangle could be cut not only by the roots but also by very thin edges and roots.
Some scientists believe that tricythetopes have eaten ticadas, which were known as plants of the Caucasian period.
These plants are like a small ravine that has at its top a hole, a hole in it.
The green dinosaur could use its powerful nest to remove the leaves before eating the seeds.
Other scientists argue that these plants are very toxic, so it's unlikely that any dinosaur would have eaten them, even though today the fungus and other animals (the dinosaur's successor) can eat poisonous worms or fruits.
How can the speed of Ioo be measured? If you stand at the level of Iooo, you will have less weight than you measure on Earth.
The man who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth will measure about 36 pounds (16 kg) on io. So, the speed is, of course, less than you need.
The sun is not like the outer layer of Earth that can be seen on it. The whole sun is made up of weapons, fires and plasma.
The gas gets better when you move from the center of the sun.
The outer part of the sun we see is called the lighthouse, which means "the beam of light."
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope and saw that there were holes like the glass of Venus.
The poles follow each other because the sun is only one side of Wenner's (or Lusney's) view, and Wenner's poles support the view of Copernicos, even though the planets move around the sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horochs noticed the ageing of Wenner.
After Denlo's recovery, England was at peace for a long time.
Yet, in 991, Ethelrede worked with the Viking fleet, which was the largest from Gutreum's time a century ago.

Hangoul is the only special album that is used every day. It was created in 1444 during the time of King Sejong (1418 - 1450).
Sejong was the fourth generation of Johnson dynasty and was one of the most respected.
At first, he called Hanguelle Abubene Hanmy Jonge, which means "The Right Sounds to Teach People."
There are a lot of views on how the Sanskrit came up, one of which is about India's migration from the west to India, which has also brought with them language.
Sanscrit is the oldest language and is comparable to the Latin spoken in Europe.
The greatest book in the world has been written by a Sanskrit.
Sanskrit is a very difficult and rich language, which has been a source of origin for many Indian languages, such as Latin for European languages, such as French and Spanish.
At the end of the war for France, Germany was preparing to enter the British island.
The German attack covert was "Operational Coast." The British army had lost most of its heavy weapons and ammunition when it was dropped from Dhakur, so the army was too weak.
But the royal ship was even more powerful than the German ship called Kriegsmar, and it could destroy all the ships that came from the English scourge.
But there were very few ships in the Royal Navy along the lines of possible intrusion because the sailors were afraid that they could be cut off by a German aircraft attack.
Let's start by explaining Italy's plans. It was mainly the "little brother" of Germany and Japan.
It had a smaller army and a smaller ship, although they had built four new ships before the war.
The main goal of Italy was the African countries. To catch those countries, they would need to have the base of force so that they could sail through the Mediterranean Sea and buy Africa.
That's why they had to be freed from the British fleet and ships in Egypt. Besides those operations, Italian war should not have done anything else.
Now about Japan, it was the country of the island, like Britain.
Suzannevas are ships designed for coastal travel, and they stay there for a long time.
Suzannes were used in the first and second world wars, then they were moving very slowly and had a very limited distance to fire.
At the beginning of the war, they were mostly on the sea, but with the development of the radar and becoming more accurate, they had to go under water to avoid detection.
The German submarines are called Yu Ships: the Germans were well on board and controlled their submarines.
As a result of their success in Suzannevarians after the war, the Germans don't trust to have more of them.
Yes, Tutanhamon is one of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt at present.
Interestingly, he was not considered very important in ancient times and is not listed on the lists of many ancient kings.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous, unlike other ancient tombs that had been buried, this one was actually wrong.
Much of what is buried with Tutanham has been preserved well, including precious metals and small stones made of thousands of historical objects.
The discovery of wild horses has helped the Syrian chariots to be easier, faster and better prepared to carry out their duties as soldiers and other vehicles.
Their dead noses could break the defeats of the enemy soldiers. About 1,000 B.C.E., the Syrians represented the first warrior.
The trainer is a kind of army fighting on horses, so the bomb has not yet been invented, so the Nazi rider has been fighting on horses' tails.
We know very many ancient political actors, scientists and artists -- probably the most famous of this culture is Homerus, the most famous eye-catching creature that has ever created the heads of Greek literature -- the Illian and the Odyssian poems.
Sofocles and Aristophanes are still considered to be the famous papers, and their pizzas are one of the most powerful works in the world's literature.
The Pythagorean is another famous Greek, which is primarily known for its famous theory of relationships with equalizers.
There are different values about how many people speak Hindi, which is valued as the fourth most common language in the world.

The number of speakers is from 340 million to 500 million, and over 800 million people can understand the language.
India and Urdu are the same from the point of view of terminology, but they're different in writing. In everyday conversations, people who speak two languages usually can understand each other.
About the 15th century, northern Estonia was under the influence of Germany's cultural influence.
Some German monks wanted the locals to be closer to God, so they were able to read Estonian literature.
It was based on the German alphabet, and the "O/O" note was added.
As time went by, many words that had been changed from German to German were removed, which was the beginning of education.
According to tradition, after finishing school, the owner had to go to military service immediately.
However, Charles attended the University at the University of Trinity, Cambridge, where he studied humanities and science, and later history, by getting 2:2 (second level of science lower).

The European Turkey (East Turkey or the Republic of Romania) includes 3% of the country.
Turkey's area is over 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) and is about 800 km (500 million) in a straight way.
Turkey's area, taking into account the beaches, operates 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometers (291,773 square miles) is south-west Asia, and 23 764 square kilometers (9,174 square miles) in Europe.

Turkey is surrounded by three seas: the Aegean Sea in the west, the North Sea in the north and the Mediterranean in the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence came in 1839.
The current regions of Belgium have previously been part of Luxembourg, but then they have become Belgians in the 1830s, after the Belgian revolution.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain neutral, but as in World War I, also in World War II has been captured by Germany.
In 1957, Luxembourg became the founding member of the organization known today as the European Union.
Dukkgi Dzong is a fortress and Buddhist village in the upper part of Paro’s village in the village of Fondey.
It is said that in 1649, Shabdrung Nguang Namgel founded the force to win his victory over the Tibetans.
As a result of the earthquake in 1951, Drugel Song's remains only a part of its parts, such as the image of Shabatrung Ngawang Namgiti.
After the earthquake, the fortress was preserved and protected by remaining one of Bhutan's most remarkable sights.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was under pressure from its two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.

In order to create interactive media, you need conditional and traditional skills, as well as tools that have been released during interactive classes (images, sounds and videos), stories and so on).
The interactive design requires you to reevaluate your assumptions about creating information and to think about non-linear ways.
When you come out of an interactive design requirement, the program's components must be connected to each other, but they're not identical as a separate part.
The lack of focusing objects is that the weight of the focus needed to detect the lengths of the focus is much greater than the number of targets that guarantee the permanent distance of the focus.
This becomes a little less important problem because the Spanish producers are reaching higher standards in the nature of this production.
This allows you to get the image of a quality that is comparable to the image of a fixed focus width.
Another drawback is that the maximum openness (speed) of the objects is usually lower.
This makes it difficult to use non-valued light-free mirrors under low-light conditions.
One of the most common problems with changing the DVD format is the wide size of the image.
Most of the television works to please most of the society.
So what you see on TV, that's why it's got its emphasis on the top, the bottom and the side.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. It's called the overall content.
It's heartbreaking when you're making a DVD, and probably it's going to be cut off, and if the video signatures are very close to the bottom, they won't look completely.
The Indian Middle Ages has inspired people's appearance for many years through the imagery of the Winter Wars, the Fascism and the Winter of Arthur.
Even standing in thousands of years, it's easy to detect the sounds of battles and sheep that took place long ago, almost listening to the sound of bullets that hit the salaccharists and the fear that comes from sturgeon attacks.
But is our appearance really based on reality?
In time, the school of Kirby Muxslo is better built than the real school.
Its large, narrow windows and narrow walls would not be able to withstand a decisive attack for a long time.
In the 1480s, when the building began by Loro Hastings, the country was relatively peaceful and needed protection from only a small band of surgeons.
The balance of power was a system in which European nations wanted to preserve the national sovereignty of all European governments.
The plan was that all European nations should have tried not to let a nation become powerful, so national governments often changed their structures to maintain balance.
The war for Spanish heritage marked the first war, the main issue of which was the balance of power.
This has been an important change because European forces will no longer have the power to wage religious wars, so the Thirty Years' War will be the last one that will be destroyed as a religious one.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was completed on July 21, 356 C.E., as a result of a restoration by Herodotus.
According to the story, his spirituality was in line with any war. The Ephesians who were misled declared that the name of Herodotus would never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabbon later mentions the name and here's how we know today: the temple was broken the same night Alexander the Great was born.
As King Alexander proposed to pay for the reconstruction of the temple, but his proposal was rejected. Later, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.

Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent, which arose in the 15th century in the Panjab area as a result of the sexual corruption of Hindu culture.
Sikhs consider their faith to be a separate religion from Hinduism, although they accept its Hindu roots and customs.
The Sikhs call their religion Gurumata, which means "The Way of the Goru." Guru is the basic aspect of all Indian religions, but Sikhism has gained importance by becoming the foundation of Sikh beliefs.

Children are very young to form a picture of race and race planners, and these race planners influence behavior.
For example, children who have a well-educated racial minority, who are underage in school, tend to be underprivileged at school when they know about their race-related program.
MySpace is the third most known page used in the United States, and there are now 54 million users.
These pages are worth a lot of attention, especially in educational institutions.
These pages have positive aspects that include easy management of the classroom, which can include blogs, videos, photographs and other features.
This page can be easily accessed by just one page, which makes it easy to remember and print for students who have difficulty using a device or writing device.
It can be adapted to make it easier to read, as well as with any color selection.
The focus of attention is "a neurological agreement whose classification is a set of symptoms, including impulsivity, confusion and hyperactivity or increased energy pressure."
It's not an inability to learn, it's a problem to learn. "It affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, probably 2 million Americans."
Children with a lack of attention spend hard time focusing on such things as school work, but they can focus on things that make them happy, such as playing games or watching their favorite films or writing without any preoccupation.
These children tend to have problems because they're "introduced into risky behaviours, they're fighting and they're fighting against the government," to interfere with their brain's work, because their brains can't go through normal methods.
THE idea of relationships with peers is that other children cannot understand why they are doing so themselves or why they utter the same words or how different their maturity is.
Because it changed its ability to get knowledge and learn as mentioned above, many of the news to get knowledge changed.
The approach to getting citizenship was different. The impression was no longer dependent on one person's opinion, and the ability to reason on the text was worth more attention.
In fact, the theory of evolution has changed significantly in terms of access to education and the spread of knowledge.
Unlike other Primates, Hominides no longer use their hands when they move or depend on trees or keep their weight.
The chimpanzee's hand and foot have the same size and length, which shows the use of the hand to keep the weight.
A man's hand is smaller than his foot, and his fingers are more upright.
Over two million years ago, the cuts in the hands of the bronchial arm show a change in the specificity of the hand, from movement to movement.
Some people think that a lot of artificial gin dreams can be quite often very stressful.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that it's time between U.S. situations as a result of simple dreams.
In the course of the night's sleep, the situation in which you're actually asleep and your body is restored becomes not enough to become a problem.
It's just as exciting as you've been watching every 20 or thirty minutes and watching TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to dream consciously during the night.
