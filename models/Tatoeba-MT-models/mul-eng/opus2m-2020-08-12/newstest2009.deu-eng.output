The Prague Börse runs against business closure in Minus.
After the stolen waste in the morning, the Prague Börse managed to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal day business.
The Prague Börse was related at the beginning of the day's work on Monday when it fell to six more percentage points.
This time the reason for the use of Wall Street was.
In the Czech Republic, the market's response to the outcome of the US House of Representatives' vote was also shown to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector.
In case of action in Asia
A dramatic case occurred on Tuesday in the stock exchanges in Asia, although the indexes were able to balance some of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Hong Kong Hang Seng Börse index lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but later it was able to settle some of the losses, thus reducing the return to about 2.5 percent.
The Hong Kong Hong Seng China Enterprises, which observed the movement of Chinese shares at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, decreased by 3.8 per cent in Shanghai.
The share of the stock in Sydney lost more than five per cent, but then the loss decreased by 4.3 per cent.
The beer in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent after the index there.
"The timing for the rescue action in the United States is uncertain and the financial markets will be influenced worldwide," said the head of the monetary authority in Hong Kong, Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong determines, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, so independent of the Central Bank of China.
The interest rates in Hong Kong move to the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the US legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and approve the draft for financial support.
Otherwise, it would be safe for other countries to be affected by the use.
A Bloodbath of American Shares
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the plan for financial support on Monday for up to 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 billion Kč).
The legislators therefore ignored President George Bush's request to support the plan.
Bush's view is that the plan would regulate the main causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the whole economy.
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the most important stock indexes recorded the largest consumption in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost seven percent, and he had recorded a similar outbreak last year in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was hardly any indication that the draft would not be carried out in the House of Commons, the index experienced a free case.
Congress makes a point: US government can pump 700 billion dollars into banks
President George W. Bush's senior representatives of the US Congress and the government have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial aid for the US financial system.
This will be agreed at the beginning of next week.
The U.S. legislators reached a surplus of 700 billion dollars (about 12 billion dollars) in discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid for the US financial system.
However, this does not mean any victory.
In other words, the congressmen must discuss some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the adoption of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated at the US Congress on Monday.
This was said on Sunday by the Chairman of the Committee for Bank and Financial Services Barney Frank of the Reuters Agency.
According to the Senate, different information could probably be agreed on the plan earlier Wednesday.
As a result, economies should be informed that the plan will be adopted, which is the first significant psychological factor for a population of financial markets.
However, it will then become a "use" due to the complicated mechanisms, as it could also help markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have explained our different views on how to look at a package for the stabilization of the market," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg Agency.
As a result of your words, it could come to an end on Sunday.
The legislator's representatives met with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of non-sellable mortgage assets from financial corporations that are seriously undermining financial firms and jeopardising the stability of the entire system.
"We are at the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we're the target," says Paulson.
A Sign for Asia Business
The global financial crisis is also very low in the stock markets which are very low.
Following the words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators were striving to reach a final agreement even before Sunday at the convention.
This is why we want to ease investment in the Asian financial markets, which are in the first period, where a decision of the Congress could influence business on Monday.
In the meantime, however, it is not quite clear that when the two chambers of the American Congress agree on the law, there is also uncertainty as to whether negotiations in the last few minutes could not be resolved on a problem.
The legislators hope it will be adopted in the next few days.
However, the law will experience some further changes.
The total amount allocated to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The original 350 billion dollars should be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
But the Congress can block the spending of the rest of the money if it has the impression that the program does not work, although at another 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush appreciates progress in positive negotiations
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the Congress may vote in favour of his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic ideas of the programme remained, which was based on money for the purchase of bad mortgage securities that had fallen into value because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've done everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to agree on the law on Sunday, the Senate then on Monday," said Republican Senator Jude Gregg.
US President Bush also showed satisfaction with the progress.
His speaker Tony Fratto stated that Bush would be satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "estimate the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of the golden screen
The President of the Banking Committee of Senate Christopher Dodd, the leading contractor, agreed that the legislators were responsible for the money programme, the protection of the taxpayer from losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for the financing of the plan.
The new law should also limit the golden screens for directors of companies involved in the programme and set up a committee to oversee the Fund.
This should lead the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and have made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also calculates with help for household owners who have problems with the return of their mortgage.
The government should deal with new rates of mortgages that it purchases, where the aim is to reduce the monthly costs for creditors and enable them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea after the main economy of Patria Finance David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And that is why you don't know what mechanism and what price the problem assets are bought.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses together," Marek told the iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week, Marek's view is not exclusive.
"It is much more important that the Congressmen agree to support the plan and that they accept it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that it comes to an agreement is now the most important thing," Marek stressed.
Double on Messers Cut: MP3-Player against phones.
We advise you on your choice
While nearly every phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 players can call yet.
It seems, of course, that it's better to buy just a phone.
In spite of everything, there are enough reasons why you should wear a private player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and requirements of the future owners.
It is safe to buy yourself a great expensive record player for home to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such music news does not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for it.
However, if you have LPs with Type Rock, Jazz or Blues in the regular, you probably dream of at least one.
This is also the case with music on trips, so with compressed music, it is simply expressed - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For one one it may not be acceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for a player, but also a Pink Floyd fan will probably hardly be able to force headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is sufficient space for each room.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The life span of the batteries is also decisive.
Some good Music Players can play much more than just music, but what they can do on the phone they don't even make sense.
No modern device is to be used as universally as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the telephone and the Simsen, it can repeat music and videos, both include, it has a better time, it has a better camera, it can also navigate.
And if you're still involved in the smartphones and communications, you've got almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little wonder, because there's no ice cream and no TV.
However, the universality of phones also brings some benefits.
The more you use your phone, the more often you will need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy coolers.
Only a few phones can play music longer than ten to twelve hours, usually it is much less.
In this regard, Music Player (especially the simplest) are clearly more efficient.
Therefore, you should calculate on the cheap phones that they can't play music for more than a few hours.
If you leave and call again, buy for security more than one charging device for the office - that is also true for expensive devices.
For MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good keep running uninterrupted at least 9 hours with one upload.
Another problem is if you want to play music on the phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the device has a USB conclusion, and not every phone without special software can directly connect to a PC.
Of course, music can be played directly on a storage medium, but only a few card reading devices will be completed without reduction with the modified memory cards used in phones.
For players you do not need any special software until you have an exception (iPod).
You only need to feed the device through USB port with music from your PC.
Most phones and players themselves set up a music library, arranged by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the evaluation by users.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address list, like the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, phones can more
In selecting a particular device, you should explore after the life span of the battery, storage capacity, quality and type of sound and of course also the service comfort.
If you have music for you, especially Kulisse and listen to them every day just for a short time in the street, then there is enough any phone that plays MP3 files.
What really can almost any phone can do.
You also don't have to control separately which types of music can process a phone or a player.
MP3 creates all, and the most music you get will just be in this format.
The format belongs to the most widespread, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format, Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also allow you to buy music online.
You only need to call the relevant pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already buy a song or album.
This service can already be an excellent argument for why you should wear a musical handy.
Unfortunately, the offer of the supplier is bad and is usually limited to rapid radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is clear that this is the kind of sale of music (such as GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) in the future will control the music industry.
The phone takes most of them.
If you like to listen to something, pick up the phone in the jackent bag while the player forgets to stay at home.
However, it depends on whether you also wear your headphones or at least one wireless speaker device.
If not, you can return to the integrated speaker, with almost every phone, but only the smallest MP3 player.
The greatest benefit of musichandy will be for many people at the price.
The cheapest prices are usually less than three thousand dollars.
For three and four thousand crowns, you already have a perfectly suitable walkman.
The biggest disability will be for the majority that no normal headphones are involved.
The best and technically efficient telephone with a 3.5-mm opening for normal headphones costs up to 50 grand.
The advantage of the player is again in the light service.
The simplest - and not unconditionally cheaper (see selection) - Player can really serve everyone.
A minimum of functions, which is apparent when dealing with the previous normal cassette record or, for example, the disc player.
There is no collusion in the form of an unduly embedded mobile internet and a subsequent account for data transfers.
What device to use now
The most cheap phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) are usually equipped with a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, it's up to two thousand krones.
I'll take care of it.
The basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already own a phone and want to buy another valuable MP3 player, then take it to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
In terms of capacity (max. 2 GB), you will not have to put more than 1100 kroner on the table.
If you belong to the most demanding audiences, take more specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have their own MP3 service keys, and the service comfort comes to one individual MP3 player.
Above all, this is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individual MP3 players sold.
The same services in the same price category from up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players of the above manufacturer.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile service market in Chechnya is right to say that the Czech suppliers offer practically all services, as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
However, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic prices to be lower.
Maybe this won't be allowed to wait any longer.
The fact that the Czech mobile service providers work at Europe's most expensive business has been reported often on mobile.cz.
This was also confirmed by the ČTÜ Telecommunications Authority, which pointed out that the price for a SMS here is higher than that of the rest of the European Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in the area of the regulation of Roma taxation, it is likely that it will become a paradoxic situation - for some of the customers of the Czech mobile service providers, SMS will be cheaper from abroad than home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really makes a struggle.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, but there are three mobile networks in the Czech Republic and a penetration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile service providers are willing to change the fact that there is extremely much competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Paul Dvořák, who has often argued in the past that there is no place for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with a own network has no more special opportunities (otherwise he would probably not even find frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
Just the entry of virtual suppliers into the mobile phone market brought a significant price change with which the classical mobile service providers had to respond.
Before the entry of companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market in Britain there were similar votes like in the Czech Republic.
However, it has shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
On the other hand, you don't have to look for examples for a long time.
In February we reported on the start of the virtual mobileking provider in Poland.
In just half a year, it was possible for this supplier to gain more than 100 thousand customers and thus rise to the country’s fifth largest supplier.
Behind the mobile phone is the Penta financial group, which is located in the Czech Republic under other U:funds.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need a lot less customers than a classic provider.
In other words, they do not need any relatively high costs for building, operating and maintaining a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers are usually viewed as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in Britain at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobileking in Poland shows, it can also be a real good incentive to set on a non-clicking target group.
This provider refers specifically to men.
"True guys choose Mobilking - the supplier they like and they can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual supplier.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept could be found in Poland as well as in Chechnya.
In addition, Vodafone's press speaker Miroslav Čepicky says: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual suppliers are based.
Moreover, it is relatively adjusted from the point of view of the service offer."
In the Czech Republic, the mobile phone service providers are free.
It is almost certain, however, that if a virtual mobile phone provider gets over Chechnya, this will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not appear to be particularly promising.
It will become more and more a market entry from Mobilking in other countries of our region," says Jana Studničková, editor of the Penta Financial Group.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the current mobile service providers in the Czech Republic have not been particularly affected by these thoughts.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
Your interest at a start of a virtual mobile service provider has been shown for a long time by the GTS Novera group, which wants to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed-net but also mobile phone telecommunications services.
And you're older, that's better.
On this opportunity we have repeatedly negotiated with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we were already able to make negotiation progress," said the press speaker of the group Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe better times come now.
Non-official information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected until the end of the year.
Until then, however, it is surrounded by a windy wall of the village.
"At this point we do not understand that there is room for a complete virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
Until now, we have no subject with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sršeň in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2.
Further suppliers also point to the specificness of the Czech market.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in a series of harmony with O2's statement: "As long as we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project to be built on."
And she adds: "In the network of T-mobiles, almost a virtual provider will be raised by the end of the year.
At this point we must already have a concrete offer to think so briefly."
Vodafone focuses more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepicky means: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual suppliers, especially in the area of sharing of costs and infrastructure.
That's exactly what we view from the customer's point of view as the best.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is looking for a partner to build a shared network for a quick mobile internet."
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers in hand
The progress of mobile service providers is easy to understand, a further provider would be more competitive, which would result in lower prices and also a return to profits.
So why should such a competitor facilitate market access?
That the suppliers can draw on a string when it's about something, also lies the long hen and her about the formation of U:fund.
The most powerful pressure towards ČTÚ was the time when U:fund came to the market, from T-Mobile company.
This includes the public information available on the ČTÜ websites.
Now, however, it is just U:funda as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competitive atmosphere of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new operator would make high demands on the market itself and, above all, his services."
However, in view of this approach by the mobile service provider, the absolute lack of interest on the part of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
It is not just about the attitude of ČTÜ, which is suffering in the Czech Republic - in contrast with the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries - does not have the ability to enter into economic competition.
This is exclusively owned by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
But this whole problem was its very typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile service provider would then be possible after it has reached a contract agreement between a mobile service provider and a virtual provider on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
Until then, such a contract has not been concluded because the offer of potential stakeholders was likely not interesting enough for the classical suppliers," so in his reply to our request Kristián Chalupa from the Division for External Relations of the ÚOHS.
Such formulation would not be surprised by the representatives of the tenderer.
This is more than a matter of concern to an authority representing the consumer's interests and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses its position on the market.
In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a country where virtual providers work quite normal, it is noted that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, it is likely that the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price change are not in the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, it is really shocking to see the almost inconsistencies of the three mobile service providers, who are affected by their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just an accident is on hand.
Just like the absolute same petrol price at the tanks, it is sure only accident and the result of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not found any signs in this case which are relevant to an anti-competitive act and therefore has no reason to intervene in the matter in any way.
None of the providers have a dominant market position, so he has no responsibility for his trade on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile functional market for virtual providers are probably also missing the regulatory authority for telecommunications," Chalupa quoted in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many conflicting points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets drawn up by the ČTÜ, after telecoms from the perspective of economic competition, a single market.
Of course, none of the Czech mobile operators have a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - for the entry into the market of a virtual provider the approval of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile phone provider - logically - has monopol for his network.
It means that it adopts a dominant position in a particular segment as necessary.
Even if you do not agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators appear to be similar.
In this regard, complaints by a number of stakeholders (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) suggest that they are at very similar obstacles when negotiating with all suppliers.
The abolition of responsibility for the ČTÜ is then a right-of-the-art trick in telecommunications services, which distances the ÚOHS from the whole matter.
This was already observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to implement the recent novelty of telecommunications law to enhance the competence of ČTÜ in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts have agreed to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this only too well, but they are likely to have other interests.
It's time for no one to look at it.
In spite of this, it is only once that some pseudovirtual providers are functioning, of which there are several equally in the Czech mobile networks.
It is companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services which are only part of the public.
It is normally about companies acting in the area of multilevel marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others offer their own mobile telephone services.
The prices lists of these companies are usually only available for choice.
The whiteness of the case is that the company appears to the operator as a classic customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it will then receive special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar type of further sale.
"If there are any cases you describe, then it can be a breach of the contractual conditions with which we will then deal with what can lead to an end of cooperation with the society concerned," answered Martina Kemrová on our question.
It is, however, quite unlikely that such a thing is not addressed to the mobile service providers.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it may concern thousands of customers.
However, no operator would object to such a procedure.
They are not affected by the activities of these companies, i.e. they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, although all these companies' services are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card does not run on their phone, so they cannot fully have it as the normal customers of mobile service providers."
However, at least this had to happen rarely.
In addition, a further question is raised for the ÚOHS.
If the mobile service providers agree before such a procedure, why stop them against a virtual provider?
It is also true that the ÚOHS has a right of great competence to discover such activities, and if it does not, it must not be satisfied with the supplier's statement that they did not know anything about them and that their business conditions would not be satisfied.
When Chechnya is no longer expensive
As already stressed in the text several times, the market entry of virtual suppliers brought a significant price decline in the various services.
They have virtually all countries where virtual providers have been created, the classic providers are trying to prevent their creation from virtually more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - too small, or too high a market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in the highly developed countries, the regulatory bodies, which are not far from the interests of mobile service providers, are directly involved at these times, but their customers are trying to be true.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created and followed up.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are making the whole case like a hot potatoes.
From our experience, we cannot fail to realize that incompetence in these cases is more valuable than clarity.
But we don't throw the flints into the throat.
If the background information agrees and a virtual provider soon emerges, the Czech mobile phone market may soon be re-initiated.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting other stakeholders (to discriminate).
And the Czechs will finally stop calling more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Hymne has four new versions.
Find the best out
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Hymme.
On Sunday Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented my country with a new reception on the day of the Czech state at a holiday hour.
The Hymne was re-enacted by the Orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jirí Bélohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female sologging, in body and in an instrumental version.
The gesangsfasung took over Katerín Knážínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the Hymnen versions are Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can also listen to all four versions.
For Bälohlävek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had already told the Czech Round Funk that he had chosen young, representative voices that are marked and popular for the solo variants.
"From the beginning, I tried to hold a clear dictatorship to understand the text so as to create an agreement," said the director.
The Czech National Hymne will take place next year in the 175th anniversary.
The song Kde dodomov myj first appeared in 1834 at the stage of the standing theatre in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetan Tyl, the music of František Škroup.
It became popular, and people responded spontaneously.
The first stroke of the song then became an organic part of the National Hymne after the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven symbols remained after the birth of the Czech Republic itself.
How the "new" Hymne sounds
The Prague transport companies also carry on a chip for the first time in the middle of the week.
The Wednesday, 1 October 2008, will enter the history of Prague transport companies as a date on which the first passengers enter a train, road or bus that carries an electronic coupon in the bag instead of a paper ticket.
These can now buy about a hundred thousand people who own the chip card Opencard.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or a year-old coupon (as from 1 January 2009) and play it on their chip card at the same time, although in the information centres and offices of the transport companies at the U-road stations Museum, Móstek, Nádraží Holesóvice, Andël, Roztyly, Latvia, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have also been available on the Internet since yesterday at www.dpp.cz.
The service was received until the afternoons by over four hundred customers.
Those who use the internet can really forget the exit window in the U.S. stations where they had to wait regularly for long distances on their paper journeys.
They buy the Copon on the Internet, which will be played on the Opencard in one of the thirty branches of the city library.
"In these places the passengers also have a locker with a loaned staff, the interested in online purchase and also the coupon on the map," said project speaker Martin Opatrní.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play electronic coupons on self-service cars on the opencard that are included in some U-Streets.
How do such machines look?
They are red, remind of drivers, the passengers may already have noticed in the bus stations Roztyly, Budějovikká, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city until the end of the year, but it should be eight," Opatrný adds.
The Coupon controls a car instead of the driver
It's easy to handle the machines that will work from tomorrow.
You only have to introduce the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon plays itself.
Electronic coupons are applicable not only in the capital but also in the environment.
So in the city and on the bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, the inhabitants of the central boroughs of the region were first reached in the city.
"In trains which are part of the transport integrated into Prague, accompanying reading devices with which they can verify the duration of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid Organisation. This organisation combines the road plans for Prague transport companies.
The buses in front of the city have card reading equipment at the driver’s box.
On entry the chip card must be displayed not only on the driver, but the opencard must be placed at a marked position on the side of the box.
The driver thus controls the validity of the recorded coupons.
"To check the validity of the recorded coupons, a driver will not be easier than to ask the driver for this information," Drapal said.
A driver who does not drive by bus and no longer knows when the coupon’s validity ends can then return to the self-service car where the coupons are placed on the map.
Here the information on the validity of his documents is shown on the display of the device.
The Saudis asked the United States for a referendum
In 1945 the Southern Germans had sought the introduction of the Böhmer forest to the United States.
This is from a letter which is stored in the collections of the Southbömian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the U.S. government.
With such a desire, some groups of South-West Germans should have joined the US Presidents in 1945.
This is from a letter which is kept in a private archives and is kept in the collections of the South Bömme Scientific Library today.
The Germans of Krumau are asking the US Presidents in the letter that he will not allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was adopted on the basis of the Munich Treaty of Hitler - to the Czech Republic.
"We have really understood the situation and want to make sure that the US units are not in the form of pressure and enemy of German territory, but as a freer," it is in a letter signed with the words "People whose destiny is in the heart of the Sudan".
Since the accession to the Czech-Sweden-Sweden Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - makes it possible for them to expect brutality, incompetence, incompetence, oppression and slavery, the author of the letter asked the US Presidents to take over the forest of Böhmer for today and forever.
"We can't believe that you have, without the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, spoken for us a foreign state, tried to suppress and eliminate minorities and have contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies," is read in the letter.
The reason why the authors are unable to sign is that the fear of the "Cechistic pressure" strikers.
If the U.S. President raises doubts about the view of the Böhmerwaldeschen, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a referendum in Böhmerwaldgau on whether the inhabitants of the United States wanted to become part of the United States or under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter in today's postwar history may sound somewhat naive, it is, in the opinion of some newspapers, a good picture of the expectations of the Southern Germans.
Even if the Germans had to know at least that they would be negotiated on their withdrawal from the Republic, only a few of them had such an opportunity at all.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to deal with some sort of autonomy for the Sudan.
Other people thought they could just stay in the Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the well-known Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as a German German mariner at the East Sea.
When he arrived at the end of the war in British prisons and was taken to a military prison in Holstein, thousands of other bohemic Germans came to him, he was to help them in Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, they would be able to adapt to the Czech language," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia had calculated his opinion that he would be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Benez Decree.
You don't think - then pay!
An emotional campaign is directed at car drivers
The first action for safety on the streets in the Czech history.
The emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday, was also characterised.
The authorities of Minister Aleš Rébíček are committed to bringing drivers of dangerous behaviour behind the chain.
The campaign for 150 million kroner will run on television, on radio, on cinema, on the Internet, but also on planes.
It will take the driver from too fast driving and alcohol to tax.
And they also remember to take turns on their journey.
The campaign wants to talk to young drivers, motorcycles, pedestrians, and not least professional drivers.
And what's going to be shown in the spots?
Especially the stories of people who appeal to emotions.
It also shows the "blood" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - then pay!
The words "do not think" are in capital letters on a child's character.
And then in a bloodthirsty there's the word "beautiful."
This should mean that you can pay attention to your own life.
The spots will "shock" the viewers by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the English countries, where it is normal to see images of tragic captures of victims.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and the number of traffic accidents on the Czech streets.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar bread and pastries for car drivers
"For the driver the motto sugar bread and peitsche is applicable.
Sugar bread means that when they drive at red, for example, they save time.
The Peitsche is then the execution of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says the hospital's transport psychologist Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that's why information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising are necessary, says psychologist.
Its view is already less effective than tables that alert drivers to a danger.
"If you set up a static table that warns of a danger, they will probably soon flow with the environment, and the drivers will no longer see them," Kořán says.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied areas in exchange for peace
The President of the Interim Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, spoke about the return of practically all areas occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Mountains, if it is possible to end peace with Palestine and Syria in exchange for peace.
He emphasized this in an interview published on Monday by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (worked) areas if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We have a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israeli territories) because there will be no peace without them," he added.
He hoped that any return would also include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozer to play over his legs, as one of my best friends has done, will be forced into part of Jerusalem," observed Olmert in a play on two attacks in the city in July where several people were killed and thousands were injured.
According to the Premier, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temples and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the ancient city.
"The one who wants to maintain the Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Deduction from Golan heights
Olmert spoke of Israel's withdrawal from Golan heights, which he viewed as an inevitable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some efforts on the sides of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to close peace with Syria alone and only on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Highs," Olmert confirmed.
"The Syrians know only too well what they need to borrow in order to get back to the Golan heights.
They will have to rely on their current relationship with Iran; they will have to rely on their relationship with the (Schitian) Hisbollah movement; they will have to rely on the constant support they have provided for the terrorism of the (Schitian) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the Dschiyad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister concreteized.
Ask after the accident: Are Stewarts illegal in the bus?
She doesn't know the law, she's not allowed to travel by bus.
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus by the Society Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewart and Travelers can drive on and on the bus.
"If we want to adhere strictly and formally to the law, then the work of a Steward is in opposition to the road traffic law," said Karel Hanzelka, speaker of the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, which took over a 20-year-old Stewartes last week, was probably caused by the LKW driver who crossed the bus.
The young woman at this moment was in any accident near the driver at the least safe place in the car, although she still had two more seats.
A bus can also have an accident at the moment or blow a bell in which the Steward coffee or newspapers come out.
A role also plays whether the bus is also equipped with parking spaces.
If this is not foreseen in the bus, the passengers must sit down.
The train bus by Student Agency has no seats; what the company's director, Radim Jancúra, confirmed against Aktualné.cz.
"This is what we have spoken to the Ministry, and this has not initially approved the movement of passengers.
This was taken back later, and we have reached a consensus that passengers should go to the toilets when they have their seating place," he shared his position.
The law doesn't know Stewart.
"There is no clear legal explanation for the role of a Stewart – no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no law prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The road traffic law only knows the concept of vehicle accompanying it; but it does not define its rights and obligations," adds the speaker of the ministry of Hanselka.
The Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorní believes that the law covers this problem at night.
"It depends on whether the bus in the product authorisation also has seats.
That's all then," he says.
Buses are divided into urban buses where there are parking spaces and the maximum speed is limited, transport buses with parking spaces and a higher allowed speed and road buses without parking spaces with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP specialist for transport safety Jaroslav Horín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of Stewart on a bus.
"In a flexible way, there are few risks, the situation is comparable to the service on the board of an aircraft.
Nor is it safe here when turbulence comes, and the Stewarts can shake their head."
"But at least a bus is expensive, then of course also the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a street street.
The safety of Stewarts needs to be clarified by internal regulations," he says and also believes that this problem will not be solved from the perspective of the law.
Jancúra is ready to perform the services
Student Agency offers as the only bus company services of Stewart.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider his profession to be risky after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the profession of Stewart is risky, I will strike him.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by passengers at the entrance.
This would also reduce costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin is based on the lack of Stewarts in his bus. But his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have Stewards, but we've been fighting since the beginning.
Earlier or later this ends with some fatal accident," he had not declared a whole year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy.
In the case of a line bus to Naples, a young Stewardess from the Pilsen region had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian LKW was probably blindless from the standby and had stopped the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to get rid of a sharp manoeuvre, but agreed with the right advantage with the LKW.
That the two places were sold for the Stewards, Jancúra argues.
"These places can't be booked on remote connections, they're blocked."
The company wants to apologize to LKW drivers.
With a fine for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but it will also expect financial damages from the debtor's side.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more precise system of movement of Stewart on a bus could bring about a legal arrangement in which a thirty-one expert team of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"This, however, has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the road and the use of telephones on the road," says Fachmann Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider Stewart's activities to be a threat to the safety of passengers," Hanzelka said, while monitoring the safety of the bus in the competence of the police and the labour protection authorities.
Düsseldorfer Hopes Rest in Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter of the WestLB delegation to the staff of the house.
By bringing together units of the Düsseldorf Financial Institute with the Frankfurt Deka Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen Financial Group" could be created, which is the letter that became known on Monday.
The WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable revenue in such a business.
And in general, such a link of the decisive interest could be to further mergers in the banking sector.
This is how a board of directors wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the attacked WestLB is still under intense pressure.
Not only since the EU Commission, but also through the Federal Office for Financial Services, which the North Rhine-Westphalia Government has recently clarified, it is time to find a solution for the future.
From a long-standing relationship between the Deka Bank, the savings customers know about their investment fund, and the WestLB has been talking for some time - also on Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-bank chief Franz Waas has made it known in a merger of the house at the Mainzer Land Street with a bank of land, such as Helaba or WestLB, he does not see any point.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is responsible for half of the national banks and savings bonds, has called on the Board to hold talks with the WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks are free, so it's called at the financial place, just beginning.
For the first time, the Deka Bank, which has been counted by its 3000 employees to the most important employees at Frankfurt, is not talking about consolidation in the Sparkassess sector.
In 2003 it looked as long as the Deka bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, there was nothing from this triangular bond.
The plans were almost public, the Hessian Government spoke against the participation of Helaba.
Neither did the two other houses find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to Baden-Württemberg Landesbank in Stuttgart.
However, it has always given back reflections on the connection of the Deka bank to national banks.
Finally, however, Günther Merl, President of Helaba, had spoken against planning games in association with his house.
It seems, however, that a combination of the various houses of the public-law sector needs to be taken into account.
After the day-to-day election in Bayern, a link between the BayernLB could be withdrawn from the Baden-Württemberg Landsbank.
For Helaba this is not necessarily a good news.
If the pressure is to increase further mergers, go after and after the partner.
In the south she would only be more young partners, although she has been far better able to cope with the financial crisis than the households in Munich and Stuttgart.
In a meeting with the West LB again, the Spartacus and Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, who is participating in Helaba by 85 per cent, proposed a rule at the beginning of the year.
In any case, stay the North LB.
But such geostrategic considerations are just one side.
On the other hand, it is about how the different business models of the individual houses match each other.
In June, Merl raised the crucial question of which business model to ensure the future of the Land Banks was not answered by the German Sparkassen and Giroverband until now.
At the end, there could also be a reduction in the West LB which is not necessarily desired there.
In this way too, in the letter of the board of directors there, it will be called for a "total solution" for the house in any case.
As with the combination of individual units with the deka bank under a hat, it will still show itself.
The second weekend is known as "Italian weekend"
For Elena it's the first, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is his friend with it, and so it's all different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter bier phase of the Kaiser brand, is a massive built-in bakery and proves the approximately 200 Octoberfest travelers, whose deep tones can produce its keel.
Elena's gonna give Luca a hug, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus station next to the Porta Nuova train station, start this evening at 23.45 p.m. four buses, "Destinction Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are reserved especially for Italians, except for Brazilians on a bus.
In a corner of the park, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated it in the night.
And that's how Marco Guarda says it's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with pelzimitate bread and a glasses with large silver balls, belongs to the bus.
Since five years they've been going to the October party, three tourers are alone in this year.
Night back, on the way back at 22.30 p.m.
Nighttime would only mean unnecessary food, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the ride, the welcome truck with Kaiser-Bier, thanks to the Bavarian clean offer, the health insurance and the German-speaking travel guide - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And they're already driving the buses into the night, on the highway towards "Brennero".
There's no beer, there's no beer.
Soon it will be quiet in the bus, the passengers sleep.
Well, they're still gonna need their powers.
It will be held in Brixen and Woodskirchen, where there are also other buses with Italian signs on the road 8 shortly before Munich again.
When Marcos Group finally arrives at the parking lot at about half an hour in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco holds a last statement, explains the attack plan.
First: Set up the yellow cappuccine.
On the left is "Octoberfest", in fractur, the internet address of Marcos Reisburo: "conoscersivijaggiado.it".
Second, "When the doors go up to the beer, it runs!" Marco calls here in the morning.
"Run!" Run and hold the places in the back of the cell.
"No front, otherwise we block, and not all silver coins on the same bank, in space!"
The measure, Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget about drinking money.
"The security people show us we're good at it!
Once you have left the places, they are gone."
Thirdly, "Today's 11:00 p.m., find it again here!" Understand?
And it's going to show.
Along the way, a yellow hat binds as road markers to trees, paintings and even to the selection site of a large Bavarian people's lot.
You want to be armed for the back trip.
It's the second weekend known as "Italian weekend".
There are no specific figures; the talk is of 50,000 who make themselves across the Alps and fall into the biosphere, 10 percent of all visitors are expected to be extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are strengthened by seven South Tyrol police officers and Italian volunteers support the Bayerische Red Cross, which is leading a national statistics in which Italians (about 60 uses) and Austrians (about 80) are placed in the first place with about 200 medical care.
Especially popular for Italians is the court.
Sleepless nights for believers in the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, stressed by Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
How good it is that the politician used the word "relative" and also implied that the German banking sector will not be affected by the crisis-related developments.
'Cause it's been introduced on the weekend.
The Münchner realfinanced mortgage (HRE) noted in the Dax receives a billion credit from a German bank consortium to withdraw from the turbulence of the markets.
One person with the situation said Reuters on Monday that credit aid amounts to up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate must only sell the part that it also claims.
Money comes from both private and public-law banks.
The background is lost at the daughter of Depfa.
According to a report on long-term projects for which he has paid money, the financer had been very short-termly refinanced - which is no longer possible because of the mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve was reduced by 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio was slightly increased from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current revenue and net income from financial transactions were zero compared to the previous year's period, the revenue from subscriptions to claims and certain securities and the resolution of return on credit transactions decreased by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only in terms of higher revenues from post-settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as from the replacement of interest after the debt regulation and from the provision of business for corporate companies, the decrease in income was still moderate by about 16 per cent.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financer was initially represented by commercial real estate loans which were then transferred to the AAREAL Bank.
In view of the low cost of classical state funding, the Depfa had then been strengthened in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community private investors and the state (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
At the daughter's value, the Hypo Real Estate must now make copies that have a " material effect" on the group's profit and loss calculation.
The fact is that the dividends were broken.
In 2007, she was reduced to two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major public and infrastructure financer since the Depfa acquisition.
It is more dependent on the refinancing of the interbank market than other institutions, as it has no customer inputs.
With the collapse of the U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the credit transfer under the banks was rescinded, as the banks claimed their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a portion - about 50 billion euros - of the loan portfolio of the Depfa short-term funding.
After reporting the Hypo Real Estate, the group’s funding needs with the credit have been covered over for a considerable period of time and the company has been described as "from the influence of highly functional international currency markets".
From other sources it is to be heard that, thanks to the money, it is safe to refinance until the end of 2009.
HRE President George Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to claim the cash markets at a reasonable time.
The Bundesbank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services (BaFin) show that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secure.
This is to be expected for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But in view of the dynamics and inequitableities of the crisis there may be no certainty.
It is not even surprising that funding must not be taken fully into account.
But the opposite is also not to be excluded.
After the late Sunday evening, the bank was still in the process of insolvency, nor could the temporary rescue be allowed to slow down the measure.
The share rate is 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
It is right to stand up to the loan rate.
When the previous debts are almost moved, the course of after-rank loans will be more clearly followed.
In particular, the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and of course the extra-2009 periods are concerned.
A speculative investment option is designed to ensure that its value is taken into account after the significant deterioration of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which, by taking over the crisis into the house, had only been taken into account as a result of the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the notes banks, governments and less targeted business banks are ready to support the system, they can be excluded from a time-consuming balance of interest.
Or it comes up what hardly anyone else can hope for today - that the financial crisis will be overrun in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the above-mentioned reports by the State of Participation, it is now only a legitimate hope that the safety limit will be met.
This should, above all, prepare for the long-term believers some sleepless nights with the decision whether they should separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use a closing line to create a lost contract for future deduction tax payments on course winnings years later.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
As Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, she was supposed to be at the Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls started to cook: The German is total "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - she tells Japan in her new exchange log.
"The first day of trial in Japan.
I was upset.
I already had bammel before school.
I lived on the coast of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and traveled 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way myself. I didn't leave.
The start of education does not appear to be as strictly fixed in the Tachibana as in our home in Lower Saxony.
From eight o'clock until twenty-nine a short discussion round begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before I started teaching, I was on the line to introduce myself.
I'm not even the guy who wants to talk to people, or before a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school uniform yet, I had an old rock of my host's mother, which included blue, blue knobs and black leather shoes.
So I put myself in front of the pult and tried to say everything right: 'Seyonara Where she Sylvana...' - I'm called Sylvana, come from Germany and have a week of birth.
At the time, I was very glad that I had started to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all kissed, kissed and kissed and kissed and I have always heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew it from my mangas.
It belongs to the survival rate of Japanese girls and means 'precious, sweet'.
Then I'm quick to move to my place.
The girl beside me has quite wide borders, she found it an honor for the exchange student to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong died, I was regularly beaten.
Everyone talked to each other and looked at each other and asked me questions in the mouth - it is really difficult to understand Japanese.
In the break, all of them packed out their Bentos.
My host mother had also made me a lunch box - that's something else than the German holiday bread.
I had a trip with roots, small bushes, salads of corn and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofumantel.
Most of the time I don't have any flashlights, what exactly I'm here in Japan.
Things look remarkable and taste completely new.
It turns out everything's really nice.
Well, maybe until the sauced flowers, brrrrrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a self-prepared Bento, which then makes her especially artistic - in the hope of getting to know the boys better during the break talk.
I've read about it in my Manga comics.
I've been wondering if I can see it here too.
'Why does Japan count?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I've always said,
"Because I'm fascinated now."
Finally, I've been reading the most popular mangas for years.
And in order to understand the comics and culture better, I also began to learn a little Japanese once again.
So it was quite clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a disability for tradition, seating and use.
And you put a big value here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I haven't lost myself here yet, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Even rats have feelings
A rat or a sheep flees when it is in danger that it also feels afraid?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
Just how can you check if they feel the same if they behave the way we do?
The online journal "Edge" has published contributions from well-known scientists for several years.
SPIEGEEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you hold for the truth without proving it?"
I believe that animals have emotions and other consciousness, without me or anyone else able to prove this until now where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope because all human brains show the same basic configuration.
However, once we use other species and deal with matters of emotion or general awareness, we belong to uneven areas because the hardware does not agree.
If a rat is in danger, they do the same as many other animals: they die, fly or move.
People behave similarly, some scientists end up with a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
For one thing, the wheelchairs associated with human consciousness are almost always connected to the side front cortex (because of its involvement in short-term memory and performance/control functions).
This wide region is much more developed in humans than in the rest of the primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the pre-frontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic property must lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since such a large part of his experience is connected with language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly influence it so that animal consciousness, as it may be, is very different from most of our consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine how awareness may be shown in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it is not yet measured, because of the special hardware, it is possible to analyze it through our own experience, we are facing major problems.
Most of my statements relate to the content of the known experience, but there is yet another aspect of the consciousness that should be scientifically easily accessible.
The awareness processes of animals could be examined without reference to their content, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly for example visualization.
However, in this approach, followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one prefers to focus on the neurological correlates of consciousness rather than the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also stresses the importance of the preliminary cortex for the status of visualisation.
What happens now to the emotions?
I bring it back to the fact that an emotional system such as the fear is activated in a brain known for its own activity.
So what we refer to as "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the nervous system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) lies in working memory.
In this way, emotions are closely linked to the regions of Cortex, the prizes and in particular the people.
Related to the linguistic nature, there are good expressions of feeling, because we can differentiate and categorize with the help of words and grammars in order to write them in addition to ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that emotions from primary activities in the cortex and brain sensitive regions are similar to that of Jaak Panksseep, which is more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may be directly involved in tingling emotions.
Pure theoretically, I can't answer him, but it's too convincing.
Panxseep argues what appears in rats and people like fear, probably also feels like in both cases: But how can one test whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A sheep flees at risk, even if it feels afraid?
In my view, only behaviourality can not yet show an equivalent of experience.
What helps the neuronal comparison continues: rats and humans have similar brain stems, however, not even a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for emotions?
And even if you could prove it to people, how would you like to show it to advice?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (as human consciousness is based on special spheres and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behaviour rather than the emotional feelings of councils.
In any case, progress is being made at the neurological level, provided that there is the same difference between rats and humans.
As I do not study language and awareness in councils, nor do I know whether they exist.
You can keep this for a while, but I'm more likely to go ahead than always to walk against a wall.
I'm also a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Welcome to Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be put under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of Uefa in Bordeaux as evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM with Poland," said Vasjunik.
"But this is no amnesty for our country.
The work has just started and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the time frame for the construction or reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two guests are covered.
Perhaps even the number of EM stations will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at the highest speed now," said Ukrainian Federation President Grigory Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep us constantly."
Another radical step has been taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Federation of PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Minister Miroslaw Drzewicki.
There is "the serious risk that PZPN is not able to act in accordance with the rules," said Drzewicki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not be tolerated."

Employer Dennis Quaid hits back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in the interview about Privates - and now she's worried about the ex: Hollywood Star Meg Ryan shets her guilder Dennis Quaid as a Jew.
He's ashamed, and he's coming back.
Later Rosen War at the ex-Ehpear Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their shooting, the two Hollywood players now have an unbelievably conflict with each other - in all public.
Meg Ryan, in an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week, said first about the reasons for the wedding scandal: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
The extent of the lie has only been experienced after the skiding.
As an opportunity for the soul stripease, Ryan's press work was for her new film "The Women" - the story of a Hebrew poem is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an untrustworthy husband clearly came out: "Unfortunate" was it," said the 54-year-old of "New York Daily News", that "Even the story of our relationship was reexamined and re-examined for the next time."
It was also "serious," that the 16-year-old son Jack "will be remembered publicly for the pain and changes that mean a divorce for every child."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid has been remarried and has recently been father to Zwillingen.
And so he concluded his essays with the title "My life goes on anyway.
I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's best going."
Prices for tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even as cheap as 50 percent.
Flights and nights in hotels have become more affordable - this is the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial service provider.
The company has analysed its booking data since the first half of 2008 and has established a significant increase in prices in the first quarter of the second quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, the nights have already been valid in many places.
From January to March, prices rose by 41 out of 48 European cities under investigation by an average of 6.9 per cent compared with 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where travelers from 30 to 37 percent had to pay less than a year ago.
As a result, American Express looks at the weak dollar course that led to a "recovered trip of American tourists".
Also, financial sites such as Frankfurt or London are more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Koln or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even keep record in Europe.
Also at the airport prices, the trend in the first quarter showed still above:
Due to kerosene pollution, passengers in the economic class had to pay 7.1 per cent more than 2007 and long-range long-range flights were even increased to 29.2 per cent expensive.
From April to June, prices for tickets from the economic class dropped by 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but the price changes were much lower in the business and first class.
In Germany, prices were even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose by 11.9 per cent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 per cent.
According to the study, in German Inland flights the prices have even doubled.
On the other hand, the company explains that the price gap is the resulting economic growth.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market is broken.
On the other hand, the Open Ski Agreement, which liberalises aviation between the United States and Europe, provides an increased competitive pressure.
Marks of the tense situation were the strike of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines registered in the first half of 2008 – only in Europe were these 24 airlines.
HSV hits Gladbach 1:0
With a door and simple methods, the Hamburger SV will be a table guide.
At the Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functional elf.
From Christopher Small increases the brideland for national players Marko Marin.
The gladbacher soon came into the game and broke up with a heber on the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she went convincingly to him about the lips.
He knew he was right.
"We need the second tower," said Hermann Rieger at the entrance of the Hamburg Arena.
Many were not released in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most fell back on their places.
On occasion, he was about three decades of HSV's physiotherapist, who enjoyed a higher view than some of the most influential actor.
And so his prayers were found by the people in responsible positions.
Assistant trainer Cornelius Jol denied and gave approval to the women.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg’s Chief Trainer Martin Jol.
This command will have been obeyed similarly: Lord with door two!
The implementation remained outstanding.
"It wasn't a good look today," said Marcell Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhardt also "wanted more."
The 1:0 (1:0) hamburgers have to thank Mladen Petric's headball event (11); and the condition that very weak gladbachers could not weight the weak hamburgers.
"It was a terrible victory," said Martin Jol together.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 this month.
On Saturday afternoon, observers celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the Arena and the flashboards on the video wall, which showed their unity as a class premium.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know to order it," said Marcell Jansen.
He knows that the tabled intermediate product is more for the incalculableness of the League than for the domination of his HSV.
The team with its later binding access - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the protection of Petric and the Jansen, who were expelled from the FC Bayern, is still not able to shine.
"We need more Flair and more drabble," Jol asked.
After the vote,
The wall street is full of fear.
First news from the skipper of the rescue package temporarily reached the Dow Jones 700 points.

Only a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett was involved in the company.
In the framework of the rescue plan, funds should be provided for the purchase of so-called fake mortgage paper.
However, the sum should be paid not to one stroke but to one step at a time.
On the other hand, the State should receive equity options from financial corporations which could be resolved in the event of appropriate price developments in order to reduce the burden on government funds.

Dark matter influenced flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been taking place in research for advice: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called Swing-by-manoeuvres.
Experts feared that the general relativity theory Albert Einstein could not be quite right.
For nearly 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through the world area.
Because of the rapid cooling lead, you now take the cold water.
Among scientists, for years there has been a mysterious phenomenon of confusion - the Swing-by- anomalies.
The Swing-by is an airman from space probes where they receive additional swim in the gravity field of a celestial body, that is, the earth.
By doing so, the sines can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Research Sun Cassini Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Sun Sun Sun Ulysses.
However, what researchers have been surprised about for years is that flight bodies do not behave 100 percent as expected under the age-old gravity law.
Much more comes to irregularities in speed.
The sins will suddenly be faster or slower.
Until then, the physicists could not explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-anomalie.
Some experts feared that perhaps even the general relativity theory Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, could not be quite right.
American physicist Stephen Adler from Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study still believes that Einstein is not upset, and tries to explain the Swingby anomaly with the so-called dark matter the astronomers have invented in the universe.
"Responsive to the anomaly could be dark matter which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
Because of the existence of dark matter, scientists have known world space for about ten years.
It is evident from her that a force of attraction is being observed on other heavenly bodies.
It itself is completely invisible, which means it sends and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially not visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, the dark matter always makes up a fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of her driver, the tourists released in Egypt should be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The removers from the Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom money.
Six hostages should be killed in a shooting before release.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were expelled.
Settlement negotiations should already be conducted.
Always re-enacted Germans in the Visitor of Kidnappern.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists released in Sahara are obviously free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV transmitter Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release following the reports of Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We're just checking their health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions were on their way to safety, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition should already be on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for a shooting remain unclear before the release of the hostages: therefore, after the statement of an Egyptian security officer, the fugitives were ready to stop the execution before the Sudanese army miraculously killed six of the fugitives.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the officer.
It was "just about going to take the hostages into custody" as suddenly as "this surprise" came.
The Sudanese soldiers had shot six of them on Sunday in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt and had two of them arrested.
The buyers had demanded a ransom of EUR six million from Germany; the money should be transferred by the German couple to one of them.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported on a German media officer who refused to release the hostages because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the driver wants to release the female coins after payment of the ransom.
The men should be held as long as the driver had a safe flight route.
The German message in Cairo delivered an opinion on the report.
Misuse of the stepfather "leaded to suicide"
The long-term abuse by her stepfather has led to the fact that a woman has moved, a court has been reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after having suffered eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Court of Justice in Truro found that he regularly arrested his nephew Stephanie Randle as she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in one sense: "I feel responsible for her death."
The Court finds that Mrs Randle died at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was living as a child in Coventry, Trerise had bent her eyes and bound her eyes before he had committed sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a guesthouse.
Trerise and his wife were able to separate in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His nephew went to Plymouth.
However, the Court finds that Mrs Randle, who worked for the National Trust for a large part of her time, was followed by abuse, which she was added twice a week.
State attorney Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who was an excellent surfer and driver, had been "emotional to" since 2006 and "give her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It will be accepted that it has moved through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of condolence, who concluded: "I tried to kiss her and tie her eyes."
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
I feel responsible for their death."
Justice Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely attractive fetish and must have been terrible for their victim, especially since she was first seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still, the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if she had not done so."
He added: "I take into account the effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, on her daughter over the years.
They would clearly have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data are accused
The BBC has found that the office officials who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June will be charged with "public security law".
The man was ordered by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two very confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the worst charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "They had thought that they would be interfering with the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be named shall be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause covered by the safe storage of information.
The Royal State Administration recommends that the official be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he submitted included classified assessments about Al-Quaida and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a place kept secret.
Housing companies see B&B costs in the eye
British housing companies could cost more than 80 million dollars after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government made 14 billion dollars available to protect Bradford & Bingley's investments 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive the money of employers, including 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "unregular" that companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loans will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's credit is paid.
However, the interest rates collected in the interim are calculated each year by the 700 financial undertakings which receive the payments.
The compensation programme for financial services confirmed against the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is a matter of prayer that those institutions that have acted with caution ... are now being called upon to take over some of the costs of those institutions which were far less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company had to pay for the investments it would hold, and that companies had to pay about 18% of the costs together.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that credit interest will be spent on 450 million dollars in 2009.
This means that companies have to make 81 million dollars for the first year's profit.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Companies, shared the BBC with him that he believed this was unfair.
It is a matter of prayer that those institutions that have been cautious during the real estate movement are now invited to bear some of the costs of those institutions which were far less careful.
According to the BSA, no company has been broken since the registrations existed in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest that will fall in 2009 will cover the seven months of late September this year until late March.
In 2010, interest will fall for a full year and this could be almost doubled.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without companies, their members will have to pay for costs either by higher fees or lower interest on savings.
Milk will be five Pence per liter
The people at Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase its market price to about five pounds per litre of Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and it comes after a consultation company's investigations.
The individual dealers should decide on their own whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the largest market price of Jersey Milk was finally changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is charged
A court in Bangladesh has dismissed a prosecution by former Prime Minister Scheich Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Her defenders said that the court refused to prosecute 50 million Taka ($729,700) for having been questioned by a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several swirling accusations of corruption against them.
Scheich Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released early this month against execution.
Scheich Hasina was to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, asked the military-supported transitional government to grant her unlimited freedom for the first time.
The correspondents say that although her breast-feeding was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of her release whether she can remain on a free foot if she returns to Bangladesh.
Your lawyers state that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Shaikh Hasina's appeal for bail because it says that it does not have to receive a bail since it is already on a foreign bail to be treated abroad," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huk said.
We will report a complaint against the Supreme Court."
Your lawyers insist that they need to be punished to return from abroad to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
It is expected that Skyich Hasina will return home after October 17th, said an Awami-Büdnis-Party President on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-supported transitional government took over, but in June she was released from prison for medical treatment abroad.
Both Scheich Hasina and Khaleda Zia lie all the charges against each other.
Threats to the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-Polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children are not affected by the violence associated with the Taliban, so the United Nations.
The United Nations has carried out an immunization programme in six provinces last week.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
According to a UN speaker, this was the case despite the Taliban's commitment not to stop or stop the thousands of staff carrying out the seizures.
BskyB loses complaint in case ITV
BskyB has lost its complaint against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing ITV.
The Competition Court ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that BskyB's share would distort competition and allow it to have an unfavourable impact on the ITV sender.
BskyB has acquired its share in 2006 by renouncing NTL, now in Virginia Media, successfully preventing the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB prepared doubts about the independence of ITV, which the Competition Commission had prompted to initiate an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Offcom communication agency have spoken against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV should be an unreasonable and excessive measure, in particular because BskyB had announced its voting rights.
New investigation in the US U.S. State Secretary's Office
The U.S. Secretary-General has appointed a special agent to deal with the termination of the nine U.S. state-laws in 2006.
The event was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, where the actions of administrative staff were criticised.
The report gave criticism to the officials of the white house, lawmakers and former general government official Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by the threats that lawyers were subjected to for political reasons.
Special Agent Nora Dannehy should now clarify whether the officials who heard during the investigation have joined the investigators in order to prevent justice.
The main charges, including criminal proceedings, have not been fully examined or clarified, said Inspector-General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a specialist with the power to force witnesses to speak was one of its main recommendations.
The conflict began as the Ministry of Justice in December 2006 nine U.S. state lawyers from their offices.
At this point, the Ministry argued that government officials would leave due to weak labour.
However, it was later found that the dismissed state lawyers were not judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to consider the closures politically motivated.
Some of these state officials were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking members of the Republican Congress, while others refused to investigate the premise on democratic elections.
US U.S. state attorneys are asked to investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government.
They can leave at any time, but they cannot be removed for political reasons.
Mr Alberto Gonzales, former director general of the Ministry of Justice, has been sentenced for his resignation and has reduced his office to a state-of-the-art effect.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also announced.
In particular, the report of the Inspector General has discussed the role of Gonzales critically by putting on the "main responsibility" for the decisions, its leadership role "extended" and showed itself in the "extraordinary interest" process.
Other officials, including President Bush Karl Rove's former chief adviser, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loafs should be honored with epic song
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award "Q Award" for its epic hymn "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive his special gold price during the dedication next week in London, said that he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which takes nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the song on Meat Loafs Hit album from 1977.
"Coldplay" indicates the nominations for this year's award after it has come into four categories into the lower selection.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there were some songs that went out over such materials as time and genres and "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of them.
The sound that was composed by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrument part that takes almost two minutes.
The song appeared on sale in 1979 in Britain as a single in Britain and reached place 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loafs "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 for irregular heart attacks after he broke up on the stage.
In 2007, he had to give up concerts because of an acute headache.
Later he was known to have a zyst on his voiceband.
Dark streets in town, often forgotten and sell as soon as possible
New York City has thousands of main roads, singles, side streets and other surrounding streets, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
However, it is difficult even for experienced taxi drivers and longtime locals to say where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This blessed road is located in the East Village and runs from the First Street north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a steamy gas than an active road.
There are no street paintings either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard street plan.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on the first street.
It wants Extra Place new patch to create a clean road to the villages and shops that are expected to be in the new buildings.
The other admirers belong to the long-term neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short gas, simply because it is one of the rest of the past of the house block.
However, the city administration, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the apartment building and is responsible for the road, has no interest in obtaining it.
During a meeting of the Committee on Landing of the Community Council this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay made a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
However, the Committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan to be presented in the coming month, so Susan Stetzer, the districts responsible for the Community Council 3.
"Just a very few rooms are in possession of the city and we want Extra Place to remain in the city," she said.
"There could be offers of how to repair and operate the road what may be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that small streets would be refurbished and seats designed for a Café that the company wanted to rent room.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first made public during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker from the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the street as much as possible, but it did not want to own it unconditionally.
"The main feature of the Avalon Bay is to renovate this lost gas and make it a public meeting," she said and added that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, speaker of the building protection department, thought it was actually the city's desire to sell the street and stressed that the task of the department was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to his beautiful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has preserved some of its historical impressions.
Some believe that the street received its name in 1802, as a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne, was divided between his numerous children and a narrow country was claimed by no one.
The background of the CBGB Music Club, the Punk Rock Memorial, which was completed in 2006, opened to Extra Place and the street is usually known as the cover for the photo on the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who had made the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of screws, lamps and parts of sticks, posters, leaves and chairs.
Some residents, including the blogger who wrote about the Genesisization of the East Village, rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public piece, as it is, should remain public.
Others have prized Extra Place as a rare one – a virtually unchanged splitter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Moving New York" (submitted to "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the Dead City"), published part of the city's story on Extra Place, which appeared in The New Yorker magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, once wrote: "Extra Place is a small pocket gas that is even darker than day and is marked by crushed metal tube of the storage halls, closed windows and raindrops over the past week's newspapers."
With a few exceptions, the road was just as short as a night.
A rally ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that led to the CBGB, where today there is a expensive clothing business.
Graffiti were seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle was not far from the ground from a fresh set of newspapers.
Some passengers said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be pushed something.
Fields added that, in his opinion, some people underestimated the road travel in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, wet and yellow.
Discussion on bilingual education: education in English-speaking environment
In this issue of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, head of scientific staff in California Studies and head of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a writer of the book "Not as good as you think: Why does the middle class need a choice of schools".
To speak with the Spanish voters is a complex task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the probability of successful completing the school in Afro-American and Hispanic schools is lower than in white schools" - which he agrees.
To close this gap of service, Obama’s education plan recommends, among other things, a two-language transition phase in training for those who learn English first.
Nevertheless, the question is whether Obama's use of bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in other languages as English, is contrary to his interest in reducing distance in schools.
Take, for example, "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
Most of the students are Spanish and come from families with low income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
However, in 2008, 100 percent of the fourth grade students conducted the state exam in Mathe at a good level.
Also surprising, 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year were considered to be good in English testing.
This amazing success was achieved by other methods, such as those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses its attention on verification and training, on continuous control of knowledge and a stand that does not tolerate exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practises the approach followed by training in an English-language environment. That is exactly what the teacher Linda Mikels is supposed to take into account.
This approach is based on the almost exclusive use of English in vocational training.
Mrs. Michaels, who was able to teach the idea of bilingual training, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later you would be in the classroom and you would not be able to recognize him again.
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English students?
The school's services would facilitate the answer to this question, but the political positions within its own party (the national educational associations have already supported the idea of bilingual training) and its consistent support for bilingual training make predictions about Obama uncertain.
While acknowledging the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently prioritized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the "only English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "They should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully take into account the training models that work, instead of viewing them and trivialing them.
As a result, the oil price falls further around the economy
The land price is on Monday because of the fears that even the U.S. recovery plan for financial markets could not be enough to relive the economy.
In the morning session, Rohölterterminer’s business at New York’s trade fairs fell by 7 per cent at $99.80 per barrel.
Since last month the price has dropped by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been hit both by financial turbulence at the Wall Street and by powerful windstorms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached their peak in July of $145.29 per barrel, they fell almost $90 per barrel this month in order to rise again as a result of the huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have been again concerned, although Congress representatives had announced that they had joined themselves on a rescue plan on the weekend, which should be the biggest in history.
This message was overlooked by new concerns that the financial crisis has not yet been over.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, the Citigroup will buy the bank business of the Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial corporations Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the ongoing negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems impossible to live up to the vote on the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
The German Bank’s analysts have written to investors in a communication that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe that they continue to write that good markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the welfare markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading around the world, especially to China."
Bank analysts have adjusted their expectations for oil consumption due to the low economic growth for the coming year and reduced their forecast for oil and gas prices by 20% for 2009.
Mission record displayed by series in the second quarter
Indefinite Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he spent more than anyone else in the Jets tricycle in the last eight months.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter, in which the jets turned into a triumphal procession.
"I've never seen anything like this before," said Ellis.
After a devastating game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which addressed the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Fabres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect assignment one afternoon at which their development cooperation took a step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which once emerged as an outsider and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I haven't been very hard on myself," said Cole about the steps that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has been voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing, the defense of the Quarterback Kurt Warner took place.
An outside defense Darrelle Revis got a broken bow and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and got rid of him.
Linebacker David Bowens then took care of a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced by Bowens, was probably the most fucked up.
The Cardinals had won the ball with another 10 seconds in the game when the jets took the ball back and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot into 34 to 0 leadership.
That was most of the points that the jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the wagon, Erik Mangini, the train of the jets "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
On the answers both, because the jets left in third quarter 21 points to achieve no one but one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I have enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A number of points have been achieved in a short time."
Excavated Brassellage Strikes His World Record
Haile Gbrssellassia from Ethiopia has again shown why he is held by some for the best long-term runners all the time after he broke his own record in Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to get the track of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course at 2:03:59, Brasselasia has improved its previous result from 2:04:26 in 27 seconds, which he had achieved in Berlin last year.
Gbrssellassie, 35, has thus set up his 26th world record in his diverse career, where he has achieved at least one world title or one world record on each route from one mile to the Marathon.
In the last month, breast-feeding has released the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, from fear that the air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he joined in the battle in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the target - bristleseless has won a average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since train drivers such as Brasselasia and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed to long distances, the record time for Marathon in the last 10 years has fallen more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, he announced the press's bristleselosis, had had seizures in his yard two weeks ago and could therefore not train for a week.
Apparently, he was refreshed after a break and did not come back upset.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"All is perfectly running.
I took the training again a week ago and had some concerns today, but at the end of everything everything was great."
He was criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Rivalen from East Africa - that he had over-orchested his race careers, that many of the world's best Marathonstars are generally concerned about being too much on race leaders than if it were a train race and put a world record on the fight.
This criticism, however, does not harm the size of the brake blade as long-distance runner.
With four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselasie had reached the centre of the track at 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kambai and Charles Kamathi have continued to require surgery after the timers left.
A little more than three miles before the finalish has made its last move to get rid of Mumbai, which has arrived as the second at 2:05:36 and thus has improved its best time for almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi was third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now from Germany, has completed a remarkable year by showing with 2:19:19 the fastest result of all times.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Britain.
In the last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko was surprised to win the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She has missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as relapse. However, she has managed to win Berlin and improve her best time in her third Marathon in five minutes.
She planned her career by leaving a quarter of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners first, but after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magrasa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as a third in 2:25:01.
The pride and passion in the lives of the black people, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the growth of the leisure parks around Orlando, a few miles away from the gliding, sound and giant rides, is a quiet city in which the pride and the complications of African-American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the home city Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as simple to describe as Horston did in 1935: "The city with 5 lakes, three crockets, 300 brown hills, 300 good Swimmers, more than enough guaven, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it's a place of refuge.
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee are at the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet it is and remains the city that describes it – and which made it a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida Traveler, which was produced during the time of the German writer's depression – in many respects is a place of very special species.
Eatonville is as independent, preaching and private as in the 1930s as Horston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "so little knows about us that he doesn't know what's going on with him."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion on racial relations, many here are still sorry to be observed by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our history is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a citizen of the city and a community member of the oldest church in the city.
It has to be true."
Eatonville has long been defined as the Paradox of the triumph and the fight.
It is a historical example of black movement as well as a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, where poverty rates double as high as the country average.
On the one hand, it is an example of - sometimes condemned, sometimes prized - black culture of the rural South which has its roots in the American slavery.
It is not surprising that people here are both proud and proud.
And that's how the thoughts about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone named it here.
She introduced her home city in books that were written by her heart and in mouth, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Your Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida road driver changed the city, located near the route 77, a road leading through the often forgotten center of Florida, to the square of black history and human drama.
Both in real life and in literature, Horston reader led to the loading of Eatonville's first Mayor, Joe Clarke, and then to private matters.
"From the street to the left," she wrote, "the brown-wise modern school is located with its garden and playgrounds to care for Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man from Witwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sales drinks of all kinds and is always suitable for hours."
In just a few hundred words, Horston thus brought Eatonville with self-strengthenment, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
I'm sure this wasn't a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described the things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls denied the Horston by citing the men singing songs about their beauty, which were full of sexual performances.
She added, "Many people can't do this."
It is still remembered here at Hurtson as a lively excentrizer who returned regularly after her family was taken to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Horston arrived in the city, she did this most without warning, in a schoolful Chevrolet, smoking and wearing Hossen, in a city, which even today forms something on her dignified style of clothing.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, but many respected them.
"The people were always glad to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while he looked at his chair, on a terrace behind the sea that looked at the Sabelia Sea, in the corner of all probability.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were confiscated.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was only one famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was added to an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no big event, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution to the world or their heritage," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Houston was published in 2003.
The winds came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to set up a five-way highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-way main street of the municipality.
Orlando's prefects had already pushed the road 4 through the West Coast.
The proposal was extended when Eatonville was still in a difficult phase in his history.
Force integration, among other things, had ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the Community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mismanagement brought Hass into the Community.
"At this time a bunch of white boys and they were burning oranges and witnesses to the people who were far away," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even one woman who was killed in it.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston asked the Orlando Sentinel in a letter to force the Supreme Court to integrate by referring to his decision against the school council as "constructing rather than respecting my race".
Today, residents say that despite the withdrawal of racial discrimination in some respects was positive, they failed to keep the group together in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of his youth.
"Black children were used to being around - I remember that - his teachers were around in the morning and his teachers were around in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and manager of the joint group to protect the Eatonville Community.
This could be obtained as long as it was possible, it added until teachers and students came from the same place.
"But his white teacher didn't wake up, because he was a white teacher - I think there's a cultural club here," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, the citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, players and artists who focused on advantages, as they did, with positive self-consciousness and words like: "How can anyone deny the joy of my society?
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker was on his way to Horston's nameless grave and began fighting for the restoration of her peace.
Five years later a very famous Houston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookstores, and it was again part of the American literature canon.
The street project came exactly at a time when the most famous daughter in Eatonville was once again in public light.
And this time, Horston's old neighbors saw her as a survivor.
In 1988 the community began planning a Houston Festival to show what could destroy the area with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return to the festival.
A few years later, the area disappeared from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-square street live the city, speeded up the whole with high speed, woke up real city hall," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd stressed something easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the road project has contributed to a change in the city's own image.
There have been more and more trainers, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church since 1993, and domestically began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was registered in 1998 in the national historical register.
A new enchanted library (of course called Houston) opened on the newly-fledged and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard in 2006.
Today, Eatonville is still as unique as it was in Florida: only 6 miles from the center of Orlandos can sometimes feel like an indoor gas in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black today.)
Outside the search for the story of Eatonvilles and its significance are often treated with caution.
For most interviews, permission is required in the field and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, which was painted by a white man and represented by black men in the field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a love for dark root, still fear that their lost community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Horston Festival grew up, a higher degree was also born at home.
In particular, young people tend to see Eatonville as Horston saw her entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better nor more proud, creative and flexible, tending and mixing like any other race and nation group in America.
It is the true love of this city that you can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's Neffen, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return after college to Eatonville to work in the city administration or at the police station that might use some help.
And even the disciples, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old knights from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who just walk through here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon again one Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at his story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here we are in New York, and we are talking about financial matters.
Nothing has changed at first glance.
If tourists in Manhattan escaped from the newspapers and the violent TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't even notice that they were in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the skiing offices with the glass façade, bankiers and head fund managers, who have the monopoly in New York, have had the worst horror workday ever since the autumn of 1929.
The suppliers still carry metal plates along the city walls and carry tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast.
Latinos still sleep between apartments about how human pack animals load with about 50 t-shirts hanging on one of their shoulders.
Officials are still waiting on food stands on their breakfast bag and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 hours a week.
It did not feel like a crisis at all until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon because of all the way through the world.
Although I decided to place my duty on the quiet afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribal branches, there were already about 20 people in Slang.
Not to pay off or pay cash to the money exchangers, but to the customer service switch where home customers order shopping books, to ask tourists about the way to Macy's shopping house and where new customers open accounts.
Most of me, so I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank agents with license", stood for the same reason as I did.
Unlike me, however, they had already raised their savings from smaller banks, from where they landed, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the state of Iceland.
They had raised money from so-called trophys (a little like a construction park), corporate banks and local savings that have only one state branch and said they treat their customers as a family.
In the last year, 15 of these banks have been silent and empty.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with facilities of $327 billion, in competition management over and as the last Friday New Yorkers went home, was Wachovia, another bank with savings of $440 billion, looking for a rescue buyer.
In fear of a further charge, the office and charge employees who had taken their bares before me to a bank that is considered safe port, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases at the Wall Street.
All normal New Yorkers have been able to adjust to a floating financial chain in the last few weeks.
A woman who phoned in my Chinese national supermarket took so much confidence about Lehman Brothers, the bank that had been robbed and its distinguished president Dick Full, as she would have managed to deal with a false colleague.
And Lynn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my home block, is derived from our usual topics of entertainment about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in cash market funds," she told me after I visited the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going to risk anymore."
Muslim dignitaries killed during a legal dispute in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian Free Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian Right Party of Vlaams, took part on Thursday, 17 January 2008, in a demonstration in Antwerp to represent the organization " cities against Islam".
They wear pictures in the style of traffic signs on which a mask is painted, lined up with a red line.
The police charge legal separatists of the massacre at a Muslim peace station in Austria, which will record significant gains on the very right-wing parties on the same weekend.
On the night of Friday morning, more than 90 diggers were severely injured at the Freedhof in Traun by Linz in a police operation, according to the police.
The tattoos spread Jewish symbols such as the David Star on some of the graves, but criminal officials consider this to be an attempt to break the motive of the hate on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the event is in any way related to the choices.
A speaker from the local Islamic community said she was "most deeply disappointed" about the news of the massacre that took place when the religious month of Muslim Ramadan was at its end.
At the same time, there is a round of research in Austria after the country left in the narrow parliamentary elections.
The FPØ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, which both far-right-right-minded parties have achieved nearly 30% of the votes, have put themselves in the struggle for a strict anti-immigrants law and some of their electoral speeches have been criticized as hostile.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, set himself up for a ban on headaches and Burkas and even made his refusal to food which is generally linked to Islam.
At his last customer service in Vienna, he spoke of a "European fraternity" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and mines with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Questionnaires and analyses carried out immediately after the election and the assertion that the extreme rights of the political party are the strongest in the country indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel barriers for Gary Glitzer
Gary Glitzer, the Glam-Rockstar who was sentenced to sexual abuse of children, was sentenced to travel to France and Spain.
Glitter raised a six-month-old spree after informing the control authorities about it that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
The police in Kent were given the last Thursday to hold a foreign travel ban after they presented evidence to the judges of Glitter for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, right name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford's court in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning, Legal Officer.
A speaker of the Court reported: "On Thursday, 25 September, the police asked Kent at the Ashford Court for permission to prevent foreign travel from Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not present personally."
According to the Register for Sexual Offences, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He also has to notify the police seven days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a 5-year prison sentence.
The police in Kent said she would not discuss individual cases or possible residence in the country.
A speaker from Kent's police unit said: "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"Our view is that it is easier to control someone who is in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the greatest duty of the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual offenders in the country, to minimize any risk that might present to the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom in the last month after he spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not leave him by passport control and he flew into one and went to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials said he would return to Britain.
Finally, on 22 August, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge's court in West London, where Scotland Yard successfully requested permission to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter was arrested in the United Kingdom for possession of images of child abuse in 1999 for 4 months.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was pleased and pleased that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
"I received the master behind the stage to hold his character," Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no noises, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the large flamencotners who leaned on the concentration and devoted themselves to the interpretation to get a relaxing look as a woman or as a man.
Home Artist
On the other hand, personality
I look back in private life, at these moments that are foreign to the public, I know when I can find for the personality typical gesture, the depth of a stolen look or expression of the hands that are concerned because they cannot be included in the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents a variety of theatres on the stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. On this side he was still little known for artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamencoding at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the month of Flamenco's photography program, reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which from day to day becomes ever larger,” explains the artist and makes it clear that ` Flamenco-people' can be any person, but if you look at the photos, the viewer notes that there are no typical images of artists on the stage.
All normal people on the portrait are artists who are able to express their passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
To be able to determine the identity of this artist, you don't have to make any photos on the stage.
Her personality and character are in her heart.
What I was interested in creating a personal atmosphere that would enable me to keep the characters of the largest flamencommissioner with the camera.'
Bauer, inspired by the Festival `Cante de las Minas', was on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that remind you of classical photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical foundations of the image, by which the image understands modernity and the idea, as the Farmer Flamenco understands: 'Music with traditional roots that change and surprise every day'.
This is not only the dance, song or instrument play, but the artist's personality, his character, which leads the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain thing which will be visible in the form of the hearing, of which it is seen, is and was the fixed goal of this work presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotomata.
Known personalities in Flamenco include Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the five selections of almost seven artists who were photographed.
The project became anthology of the flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portrait led him to recapture this idea two years ago and to realize it as a 'portrait of the veterans of sport' ('SportART Project').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, there is a great deal I like to photograph the people, to learn about them and to place me in their living conditions, whether for a short time or for a long time.
I think that in the area of photography the portrait is the hardest street.
You meet or hang on people, personalities you don't even know at all, or they let you take a few minutes alone to make a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to make my ideas come true."
The collection of the portrait of Flamencos today with the title `Flamenco-people' is shown in the gallery of El Fotomata, which is on the street named la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hercules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says that the Rome he just wrote is 'a luxury'.
He doesn't know where the Roman operation is going and why it's going on, but Mario Vargas Llosa is trying to predict the project he's just working on, a novel with Protagonist Roger Casamant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and went to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia festival, the preferred Nobel Prize winner said that the project he was working on is 'a luxury' and `all indicates that he did not have to write the Romans'.
"If I were angry, I wouldn't have done it, but I'd do it and hope to end the Romans sometime," so he concluded his participation at the festival where ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La Ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities on the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the award of the Hay Festival and who gave their voices to most of the audience, is compared with the old edition of 'Our mutual friend' and is seen in the theatre Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and noted that he had before him a publication which noted that the Peruvian, who had a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given sufficient time to be able to do everything again: how his call for literature was created from 'extraordinary adventure loss', 'favorous reading' and 'more experience'; how he wrote and `discipline is true' to realize 'the lack of inspiration', his intense work with documentation, numerous corrections and processings he made; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas had influenced his profession from 'exceived' to 'read' and how it was formed and how it was designed.
The Spanish Roman writer pointed out that there is 'no way and no way' to measure and where one can see whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure maintenance, a flexible experience', said Vargas Llosa, who claims that it 'renews effects' and 'the people still bring more each other', so I told the writer 'do not leave the ease' and 'responsibility' for his profession 'to take over'.
At the party in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: Star fighter parties fall out partly.
After the announced combatants found that the ground of the place was in bad shape, the fighting party with which the party was to be concluded in Pozoblanco was transferred to the morning.
The organizer, with the understanding of Fermín Bohörquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to move the star fight party.
So the party of the unconstant enlargement was suspended, so two of the three festivals could not be held.
On Saturday it was calculated that because of why the second scheduled star fighter could not be celebrated.
The group of Matadore consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who followed and followed the star struggle.
There was only a festival on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two listeners and an hour of the star, which he was hit more by galloping than by his art of combat.
And even worse was El Juli, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without peace.
After he had done so badly, a large part of the public responded during his second battle with Buh calls.
In Álva, two people wanted to leave the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilo Haschisch.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago.
Transport controls in Ertzaintza, in the city of Armiñon (Álva).
Two policemen called on the driver of the car to get old, where they caught the flight.
It seemed like they didn't have to keep them with the loading of more than two thousand kiloschisch.
The police followed her and took one of the drivers, the 28-year-old man known as A. A. J., as reported by the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of trafficking in drugs and falsification of official documents.
The incident occurred when the transport police officers of the Álva region had already completed their control of transport on N-1 and crossed through the city of Arminón.
They decided to keep a car in order to carry out the road control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to get out of control.
The police started the persecution until the car stopped for a few kilometers on the border. At the moment, the drivers went out of the car to run over a rural street into a forest area.
Finally, the police of the city of Ertzaintza took hold of one of the two. In the car, Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 Kilo Haschisch, which was attacked by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish belts, which were later led to precise laboratory analysis and removal of the belt to other police stations.
In addition, the officials found that the sign was 'double' so that it did not comply with the signs given in the Kfz papers, and therefore a decision was taken on the basis of falsification of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue to investigate the detention of the second suspect who, as already mentioned, could flee, but also to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old A. A. J. was taken to a police station, which will be held in the next hour.
Player Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown medicine.
Player Heather Locklear, known as Amanda's role in the "Melrose Place" series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of an unknown medicine.
A Witness observed how she tried to escape from her parking lot in Montecito in a very rare way, reported speakers of the California Transport Police to the magazine `People'.
The witness told details that Locklear `after 16:30 hours passed through the gaspedal and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forth from the parking lot, and when she got back, she got on her sunglasses several times.'
A little later the witness who at first didn't know the player was holding Locklear on a nearby street and climbing the car.
The witness was the person who informed the emergency service because she had 'afflicted for locklers'.
When the police officers arrived, they found the player sitting in her car, which stopped the traffic on the street.
They seemed to be out of focus, so they brought the police into a special drug and alcohol centre to test.
According to a police speaker, the actor showed co-operative, excessive alcohol intake was eliminated from the first moment. `The first comments of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown medicine,' said the speaker.
Locklear was suspected of driving under the influence of an indefinite substance which could not be determined, was arrested and taken to a local investigation court at 19 o'clock.
Two months ago Locklaer was released after treatment from the clinic in Arizona where she was treated with anxiety and depression.
Llamazares is that the Andalusian link of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the chief coordinator of the VL and members of the United Nations Links, has ensured today that the regional association for education will be those who will meet the decision in the case of the former town contract for youth and sport of the Council in Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, which was returned last week after he was charged with making business with family members.
'In such cases I am a major federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the ones who must take responsibility for it,' Llamazares pointed out which way the party must have against him who has so far been sitting as a citizen in Sevilla's council.
However, the president of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible examinations of the breach of the rules that might have begun with Silva: 'The VL has always been that such cases have achieved maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has `a stricter ethical code for all public officials'.
`Sangre de Mayo': Heldenbuch von Garci
Inspired by 'Episios Nationales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in 'Sangre de Mayo' is the revised version of the famous Spanish revolt against the French. This is an amazing film in the film, with about 15 million euros investment for the drawings.
In this way, the cinematist has tried to 'show a number of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired in the works of the famous Roman writer, said Carci today at the presentation of the film with Kim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of artists.
'Sangre de Mayo' with a film of more than two and a half hours, this Friday will be presented in Kinos and will be shown on the telemadrid transmitter as a four-hour ministry.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdós' literature, ensures that this work of his 'childish stream' was carried out. This he thanked Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid to film a second-century film on November 2 in Madrid. In particular, on the basis of history based on 'Episios Nationales', he accepted the order.
The total contribution of 15 million, which was made by the autonomous community of Madrid for driving, offers Garci, as he added, the 'one-time chance' with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing, the image of the 'distracted Spain' which the wrong leader sought for the fight because the people were driven back by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII'.
However, the Chinese regrets that with funding such as `Alatriste' or 'Los Fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as 'Sangre de Mayo'), some scenes from the drive book with Horacio Valcárcel, where Garci worked almost all his career, could not be driven.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in 'Volver a beginzar', worked with his usual way of working: he set himself up on the stage with the players who had to start running before and for those who didn't have castting, appeared 'democratic' and respectful, 'a part of the film director's profession is in order to provide help in the theater and in the cinema to know what's going on in the cinema industry.'
Many exhibitors on which he stands in 'Sangre de Mayo' must repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won) is the opinion and ensured that none of the three candidates representing Spain in this year before the Hollywood Academy represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither 'Sangre de Mayo' nor 'Siete meas de billar francés' and also not the selected film 'Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci expects no awards for this film.
"At first you think you're working for the future, later you notice that it's just for the mind, and now you're satisfied when you've produced another film," Garci explains for more than 30 years employment.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Sevilla Tortola Valencia
A flamencotanzer from Sevilla honors a dancer who also comes from Sevilla.
Carmen Tortola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgia Valencia Valencia Valencia), she was born in the fourth Triana and when she was three years old, her family was moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in Oriental dance.
She had a exciting life, she was one of the first combatants for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Wolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian and set up for the removal of the corset, which limited the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her traces of the dance and athletic revolution in Europe at the time between the wars, was fascinated by Isabel Bayón.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
"We are not trying to tell you about her life, but to keep her breath," said the flamencotant.
Your dance bases have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
For example, 'The Dance of the Smettering' came to me like Guajira, or 'The Dance of the Slang' like Tango.
Her dance was sensitive and I was told that my dance is also in this aesthetic area," she claims.
The insinuation consists of two extraordinary co-operations: with Miguel Poveda, who is still singing for Isabel at one of her presentations, as he did in 'La Puerto avierta'; and with Flamenco Master Matilda Coral, who wanted to work exclusively with one of her ex-school students.
"Matilde plays Tortola, a very proud personality.
I'm happy because she agreed to work with me, and I feel very honored."
The insinuation also consists of musical compositions and guitarist Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the song of Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the Viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with actor Juanfra Júarez, he "takes over the role of the accompanying artist who was Divas, in whom he has always loved."
This work also tells of a certain way of life of this woman who has been known in such far-reaching places as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she has lived normally in London.
"I wanted to call her back to memory because I think she is one of the women who have a huge influence on a particular age and whose works are no more today and therefore they are less valued," Bayón says.
The exhibition takes place today at 20:30 in Theater Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez was married in 1916, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities in the order of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the 'Trinium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The goal is to remember the fifteenth anniversary of the delivery of the literary prize and the day of the death of both.
Thus  `the triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international convention held in New York, with the restoration of the museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel Chopo de luz', which was opened in May and after which it was held in various locations in Andalusia, New York was now reached and presented during the international convention.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' published by Pedro Taberero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The goal is to make known the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet.
The U.S. can imagine without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence comes from the actor Sally Field, who worked with him in 'sensation reporter' and from the then dominant American cinema, which was left on the stage, from all America to Newman with his favorite idea and followed her.
Look at what it cost him to give Oscar.
And when he came back in 2007.
And he knew he was very ill.
Nevertheless, it was a great blow to everyone.
"What sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a big friend," said Robert Redford, "my life and my country were the greatest troubles of his life."
No one was afraid to make fun of himself or overstepped.
As a 'Father' of the Chinese and the Fatherland, he died in a tragic moment, dominated by fear of terrorists and before the collapse of the market, in which the low self-esteem of Americans on the desperate search for reasons is to hold back their dignity.
If there are only a few people who can be amazed at this hard time, then you must not be necessarily Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he was a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as various losses as well as gains: from the foundation that has written the fight against drugs and to the honor of his son from the first marriage that died at overdose, he was founded up to his own brand of homeowners and organic products.
This is a gift for the country where it cost him a lot of money to commit against a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of surprise is about Hollywood without regard for nationality and state membership.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died but the whole era.
Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar Priest said that work with Newman was no longer or less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy who came from Australia, looked forward to calling Newman his greatest inspiration.
"We have left the greatest of all of us," confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who are trying to live as Paul Newman lived today: high demands on the rule of law, a more responsible private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media age.
But there's someone who tried it, and Paul Newman was an example of it.
He was separated once and was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who was faithful, although there were probably many opportunities to be.
"What should I eat a hamburger on the street if I have a home filter?" he often laughed himself.
In heaven he will be proud to have his daughters on earth with the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, he was not as proud as the faithful couple, the loving father, the careful Opas and the philanthropist," they say.
The streets in Madrid are missing for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to hold some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the 2012 skier, may be 2016.
But I ask myself, 'Are we ready for this?'
Yeah, we're following the example of the old streets, I'm saying it doesn't fit!
She was described as a perfect road, and after my assessment, she was the worst road with everything around and out there.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if you were to observe the evaluation and I could check it out, it wouldn't be so clear.
But we're going through everything from the start.
We're starting with the ticket plate that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they already let you go, then they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the noise on the street).
So don't.
Here they will only let you get the ticket (the first one there is only to go there) and (after an endless waiting ring) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size 'S' (a second one because I need the size XL)
So where do we live?
Or is it so that after the crisis it was decided to buy a lot cheaper heavens from less material?
So good, things like these are a minority compared to the days on the street.
Unless you have to go very early to get the chip, there's already a wait-and-a-half-minute wait-and-a-half and also you have to leave the back bag.
The wait has lasted more than 35 minutes, which is unclear in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected to be expected.
Finally, as it was expected, the streets began and we had not allowed our back bags to lie before, even if it had happened once, but it would have been harder to get back.
In this 40-minute waiting period after rain, it also looked forward to the attempt to organize a population space and to cross the house.
I think that tomorrow some 500 people will probably have a deep feeling and some like me because of this chip I've got don't even seem right at the classification, I can already think that the output was wrong.
Of course, if I was asked about a perfect road, I would never feel that way.
So I think we're still going to dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) recipe
At the `Emerging Technology Conference' held by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new visual recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is capable of carrying out certain primary tasks such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft it is a route planner to move on the company's campus). The system takes note of what it hears during maintenance.
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, these 'receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room who they are and even remember how they were dressed, they can hear it and understand the keywords of their maintenance.
It can also organize the participants after the discussions in the groups.
In the presentation video, `the receptionist' notes a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group that conducts a conversation with her, and that he is not a company employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will soon be heard.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Printing
That's certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week you spoke very superficially about Microsoft's strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and don't have so many connected programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computer were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling it with the commercial furniture, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will be only for the few.
Everything is just a confirmation when you think that Microsoft in Windows versions added one or more function and `Extras'.
The change in direction is due
The Microsoft has the right to lose the operating system in general, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many suggest that the browser is not a operating system.
The operating system, as an invisible part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can work simultaneously.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared with the function of his wife or husband when it comes to sharing something with his or her pregnant mother.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you must think of its 'death', not as an absolute, but as relative truth.
What Balmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention to the operating system every time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to execute the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and each day we spend more time on the surf than in the environment of the 'Window'.
What are half of the applications available on your computer?
Less Is More
And Windows 7 must be compact, many must be compact as Vista.
It's easier, don't exceed it, less complicated.
The interest of Microsoft is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternatives to Google.
In fact they need it without any doubt. I'll set a small example for it.
The photo of this place was made in Redmond, in one of the recovery rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refresher drunk machine, a picture is confirmed: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints out a request to use its own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft’s employees used Google for online research.
On the other hand, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It will not appear at first, but at the end of 2009, even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the opportunity to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
Android and iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso has acquired it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in Edward Zwick 'blood Diamond' just like Al Pacino in 'The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to the clothing of a well-built priest.
If we start counting the countless star performances, we can go back to the image of a very strong man, with a sharp bart that had raised heavy weight in a wanderer circus.
Based on this, it is a typical male T-shirt made of woodwood, unbleached and thallied.
The English language is called 'tank'. Mr. Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, exceeds all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called in the second circle `Marcel'. The legend tells us that the name centre is connected to sport and is derived from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' is surprised at all because of his excellent cotton, because of his different unisex cuts and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (almost known) which have these T-shirts as detail on the neck section.
And note, the Belgian company does not focus solely on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have college sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Cassmire, Woodwood Hoss, T-shirts with stripes, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwater.
Although it's very bad to use them as underwear.
You're very excited.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't care about the candidate'
Her great encounter with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is attractive but full of life.
At present, the Sister Gruz takes her new activity very seriously in the fashion.
For Mónica this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their call.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the Mango company, leaving her residence and also making the presentation of the most important prizes in the fashion that sponsored the Spanish fashion house.
Be merciful and hide yourself, winner on the short trails.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/Winter season, which my sister Penelope and I have designed for Mango, and I have also visited the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and participated in the dinner to Valentinos honor.
A very intensive work time which is at the same time up.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and the 60s; there we find many ideas.
I'm going through a city and watched women how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, which I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very diverse woman, aren't you?
I believe that, but finally, everything is in one and these areas have many communities.
Ever since I was a child, I've been fascinated by the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to get back to my aunt's clothes and see her dress.
It was great to go to a leisure park almost better.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to watch the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in teaching and at the tests to watch our mirror and feel good about it.
As a actor, if you get the costume, you're moving into the real role of the actor.
Finally, everything will be connected to each other, it is so much respect for the cost designer and their professionality.
You've recently become 30, haven't you been in a crisis?
I'm sorry.
I feel better than you, I feel better than thirty years.
I find that the woman is being raped, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've done the things I've been doing since I was a little boy, and this has brought me much inner joy.
So you think you're gonna be a mother, right?
For a long time I have known that I will be a mother because my body wants it and also wants to be a young mother; I don't want to leave it.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I don't care.
I'll tell my child great happiness and bring it out with great love.
As far as the film art is concerned, you keep in mind the work you've participated in and the last year was run.
That is exactly what I want to say to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, are very impatient and frustrated and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that 'La ultimatea horo' and 'An busca de la tumba de Christ' should be introduced for the first time.
See how they like you.
A few days ago, you appeared on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a while, has just called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the well-being of her organization 'Women for a better world' and the dress we show. I know that two pieces of clothing from our collection for Mango have been extended to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
I, like those they know, would tell you that they don't agree.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this great thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a stand, I will do the same.
To support women in the third world, whatever is needed.
The car drivers that can be dropped because of the alcohol supply will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The authorities order that the driver who had three official penalties for alcohol abuse installs in his car this system which prohibits him from starting the car in a drunk condition. If he is alcoholicized, then the car does not break.
The initiative has already been announced in June in the last month and is now part of the report of the General Public Prosecutor's Office. According to their comments, it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to reintroduce the driver, which is why a course for the conversion of traffic.
In addition to the general government administration, according to experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automotive Safety will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of car drivers who were shown more than once because of their driving under alcohol influence were again taxed.
The 'alcolock' would prevent it because it is a system connected to the car, it loses the alcohol content in the diluted air and prevents autostart if the driver has made an alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is established which is higher than allowed.
It costs more than EUR 1 000, the costs are borne by the person responsible for the penalty.
In this regard, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices were already preventing up to 65 % of regular damage in the first year following their introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that each year 115 people could be saved.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to take action before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legislative reform can be carried out in the usual way and yet a reform of the basic law which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still on the Spanish markets, which is not available in any business, although it has already been built into some public transport vehicles and vehicles.
In the morning, the House of Lords will be voted in favour of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install this system in schools. This has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With a British point of view at 17:40 p.m., the time provided by the program, along with the presidential camp at Benito Juárez de México DF, the Spanish aircraft, with the first and foremost of Asturias, landed.
The sun went down, but its rays have still forced it to use its hand as a sunscreen to see the royal pair that emerged from the plane.
Directly at Gangway: the Spanish messenger and other authorities
A few hours ago I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the first and first of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Oh, very good, so you can't take people from here at the airport this time.
No, she's the Spanish, but she's lived here for a few years.
- Oh, yeah, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the first and the first of Asturias is and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting at the airport’s hangar and at the red carpet, including military protection from 27 marine soldiers, who give honor to themselves.
The hair looks funny, dressed in marine blue, and she, the hair, long-haired hair, without ordinary 'peep-toes', may have been told that it is expected to be a white in DF.
Before attending the hall, they laugh and are prepared for the photographers, in which the official result is expected.
At the hotel door, where she is taken down, one of the four largest in the city is waiting for her to be a reporter from the Mexican TV that makes fun of her.
The maximum value of the adjustment
There was probably no suitable place on the world as Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly great fashion designers and Bonvivants as Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Boton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international growth of young fashion talent.
This is awarded at a cash price of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw their drawings in the Mango branch window at Boulevard Housesmann No. 54 in Paris yesterday and almost disappeared because of the emotional excitement.
On the other hand, this is the company's second largest business in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The biggest business is in London.
So many events have taken place that you would like to thank fashion designer Valentino for his jury for his competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the environment of many famous people, the board of directors organized by Mango seems to be spectacular.
Nati, with the hard heart broken by the pain, because his brother died shortly before. He has moved from the fashion house and has some beautiful things from ELAH that were exciting. He remained at the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and has Valentino accompanied his dinner to his honor.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango's house, welcomed the guests and was so a knight that he ended up with the baron of redschild without Jackets, because Jackets hired them ladies.
Mónica Cruz, has become involved in the business and had a horse and a helmet that she herself modeled, and she wore a long, black, sexy dress. On a night's walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, she showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she got up, remembered at the old times, grabbed a stick and made a sort of 'great blow'.
Inés Sastre, she did not close the space passage through the palace's rooms, but before she showed us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the presence of Oliver Martínez, a person who has always aroused a stereotype of enthusiasm, and on Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own beds and gloves) at the Hotel International in Paris, had prayed for a room without any food.
The stars under the bright sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Council Against Stress
There is no 1,000, but one more chance to forget the chaos of everyday life.
And if there are only a few, all are gathered in a book, in which it says how to relax. The book comes into the book deals on September 30.
The week is a punishment if he sounds at 7:00 a.m. but it seems even worse to imagine coming back into the hetical rhythm that the current life requires.
The office is the tension and computer that leads to back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is no one and no two methods to combat the day-to-day creation and the problems of how to break away from the world of work.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to Yoga statements, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriottt presents in the book the whole list of possibilities that are adapted to each taste and time.
The work against stress means `1001 opportunities to relax' and thus the peace that the book delivers comes into the bookstores by the Verlag Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks it is impossible to achieve peace in such areas as employment with the help of personal contacts, this manual contradicts such beliefs.
In addition, methods are offered to maintain contact with nature or to propose 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline no longer increases in your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to apply to sofa, turn off the brain and concentrate on reading.
Talk in bed
Some kids talk at night
I am not the one who wakes up and tells us something about what happened the other day, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you'll be shocked, but in reality it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called sleep speech.
It is quite widespread, especially in children and young people.
Of course, more than one of you has been told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (one time in life, for example, as during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason for this appearance.
Often relationships with other phenomena are sought in sleep, such as alpine dreams, panicky night, Enuresis noctura (bettnas night), speech in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be very high fever, stressful situations or overcompensation.
Anyway, it's a little research phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in certain words, flimsy or it may be a completely opposite (scream, wine, long discussions ).
In cases where education is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and to consult with a specialist to see if there is a problem that causes fear and this way.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated whether it is related to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnoea or stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple preventive measures:
Don't try to get the child to sleep.
So, find a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are scary and something too wild.
In the case of nervous children who are recommended for relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them gain some inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
If the speech occurs in sleep once, try to keep the peace.
He thinks it's unharmed for the child and the next day it'll be able to remember nothing what's going on.
Practical Tips
Don't wake it up.
That's useless because the child is unconscious, so you'll get it out of bed.
Although the child speaks, it relaxes, so it relaxes.
Think of the fact that if it shows up after a few appearances, it is recommended that you give advice or find out why the child is afraid.
When they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child is not under pressure to carry out an occupation and to get more information out.
So you won't be able to achieve anything because if the child sleeps, it's unconscious and can't think about it.
In addition, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreames and why it says, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the keys you draw from it.
Maybe it doesn't tell the child that you hear that night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That's a lot of fear.
So don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that just takes a few minutes.
Home... end
After a long door line, Illhäers are finally back at success course on the field.
Without much effort, the yellow-blacks played numerous tournaments and created to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The time of this encounter, at which the attackers had a measure of ability to show their abilities, was not very high.
After a first attack by the master of the purchaser, whose remoteness was almost over the corner, domestics should easily dominate the game, and it took place in a different way first fund face with a remote, then brain with a high pass, and Roman with a shot with the footpiece to demand out of Denmark.
The opposing men blocked in the middle of the field and left only the lively Rihai at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half-time should be decisive with first two torcancers fought by Rihai and Temporal, and then with the first door for the homeless by Marais, who was right to accept a ball which was rejected in a first attempt by Dibold.
However, the Illha domestic security should not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, which required his men's cameras to continue to play in cash.
However, Denmark did not know of this and did not pose major problems for an illaheusian elephant that only slightly retreated to protect themselves from "dark" except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ball was very close to the late summer.
Sarkozy hits wild fish
Before he flys to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another diver in Britain.
In view of the strong attitude of the fishermen who blocked several British and Norwegian ports on Monday, the French President decided to meet with their representatives in the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning to meet there.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he will come with 'specific proposals'.
At the same time, the President's visit will be as a general meeting of the Committee on Crisis based on Breton Fisheries to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in the price of diesel, which has reached a record value of over EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the press speaker of the Elyséepalast David Martinon, the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies to become more competitive and to ensure the working conditions and the payment of the soul.
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning they brought to Morbihan and Calvados protest marches that caused the storm of almost ten kilometers.
The port of Quebec was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-üle did not break down.
The Queen's half cell was restricted to a spre.
Already on Monday, the souls of their determination are expressing their appreciation by burning early mornings and pallets before the fireplaces of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc demonstrations.
The movement was extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the shoreline, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where fishing nets do not come out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of trade ships.
The fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique solved the blockade of the significant total refinery in Donges at night.
Those who decided from Boulogne-sur-Mar to wait for the midweek meeting in the ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec has to decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the debate planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the National Fisheries Committee’s officers who have not supported their movement.
'The strike will continue' because 'the fishermen will not be followed in any point' and 'do not want to go to Paris', for example Liliane Cariou, president of the Fisheries Committee of Laurent.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel are currently about 50 cent, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman of the Wonderful
The unforgettable composer of 'Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 and the consequences of cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes were separated by the Chinese and committed actor Paul Newman who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps his delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian air carrier calculates this year with 215 aircraft delivered, despite the devastating recession, as a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, maintained his delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the air carrier delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer is looking forward to much of the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the size range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would take into account more than 15% of its assets
As a result of the daily issue of the Financial Times, the American International Group, which was financially supported by the US Monetary Authority, intends to pay more than 15% of its assets in order to pay back the $85 billion allocated to it.
AIG is ready to finance the sale of a large part of its business, on its international life insurance and its care for the elderly in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of the AIG Sunday evening met to check possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained at the AIG.
The assets to which the AIG would be able to separate are its Aircraft-Fileale International Read Financial Corp., its share of 59% of the reverse transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and its investments in private equity, further explains the FT.
As regards these sales, no definitive decision was taken, the FT continues.
AIG needs to act as soon as possible to pay back over 85 billion credit which has been granted by the Federal Reserve, even at the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and lose current shareholders to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the sitting Historic Morning Meeting
The New Yorker Börse reported on Monday, after the House of Representatives had withdrawn Paulson's plan to save the banks, a historical case of the course: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of approximately 800 points, and the Sunday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has decreased by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
As regards the point, the most powerful case in his history (684.81 points) was recorded before 17 September 2001, the date of the withdrawal of trade following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
As a result of the final discharge figures, the Sunday Index is mainly relevant to reducing points by 1.983.73 to 1983, and the wide-ranging Index Standard&Ports 500 by 881% (106.85 points) by 1.106,55 points.
Following the unexpected delay in the plan for the rescue of banks by the Board of Directors, which should restore stability to the markets, the Wall Street was brought together, which had already been attacked at the beginning of the quarter.
In contrast, 228 votes and 205 abstentions rejected the funds he had prayed to the Secretary of Finance, Henry Paulson.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"Here is a bad picture of the Congress which is unable to take a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was counted on this plan," she added, and feared that a project adopted in several days would come 'too late'.
"If the project is actually condemned to fraud (...), it will be a quick task of the fed (the American Central Bank, Anm. d. Red.) and other central banks to get the crisis into the grip that would limit the credit conditions further," warned Brian Bethune, Head of Economics at Global Insight.
And Ms. Piegza stressed that she was even more excited about the feeling of extreme urgency, 'that every day, it will increase the ruin of a financial company' in the United States 'with itself'.
After Washington Mutual’s competition on Friday, the US authorities planned the purchase of Wachovia’s banking business by its competitor’s Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated rapidly and led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets 'not only face an American but a global crisis' were added by FTN financial analysts.
The market for basic goods has been highly developed.
In the past ten years, the state tax revenues have returned from 3,632% on Friday evening to 3,827% on Friday evenings, and the revenues from 4,161% on Friday evenings to 4,357% on Monday evenings in the last 30 years.
Obama, winner after points in the first television show
At the first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday, another one followed to find out who was the winner of it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As the QGs are expected to announce the choice of both Republicans and Democrats to their own victory in this television show, which should be followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although clearly visible, was not 'brillant' enough to allow him to stop his return to the wave issues five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion issue on Saturday, which follows Obama with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that democracy is making a better figure.
In the still unclosed voters, so those who now come to it, Obama went ahead with 39% as a winner from the polls, while a CBS poll showed 25% of them McCain as a winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his origin on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at his first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, however, warned this weekend Bill Clinton.
Seventeen-year-old McCain did not hesitate to back up his inconsistencies in the field of foreign policy and, in this regard, to stress clearly the 'Navity' of his opponent with regard to these issues, which shaped the centre of this first television show.
"Sentor Obama doesn't seem to understand that...," he stressed several times.
'I do not believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to be President,' he also assured.
A point of attack that has been preached in the Republican electoral positions since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He seemed short and precise without getting out of the way.
He turned his back on his ability to make good decisions and to restore the image that the world has of the United States.
"McCain has not yet understood, although Obama has already set up a democratic electoral contest this weekend, in which the Republican was called upon not to have realized the full extent of the crisis which is responsible for the "Americans from the street".
"During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama pointed to 20,000 people yesterday who had gathered for an election event in North Carolina in a stream.
He did not even mention the words 'middle position' or 'worker'. The financial crisis is a clear advantage for Obama, who thinks the Americans are the best to save the economy even at the edge of the base.
'The next week could be a decisive turning point', estimated yesterday by influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative of Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared the 'good economic instincts' of Obama with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For democratic candidates, the current crisis is a final part of an eight-year poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
After stressing again that it might even have been possible to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the changes in the Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a disease insurance system, should have priority for it.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build an installation of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates pay attention to the issues raised by the financial market’s recovery plan over $700 billion (470 billion), which was adopted by the Congress last night and is extremely unaccustomed to the people.
Have you noticed that a election took place in Minsk?
Young and oppositioned Sunday evenings were shown on the main site of the Russian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Hundreds of white Russians gathered on Sunday evening after the election place was closed at the market in Minsk to protest against the deceptive nature of Parliamentary elections.
Although no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to demonstrate the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator is to return'.
Some say that they haven't even chosen: 'What's that good when they do it with my voice what they want' says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime that has shown itself to foreign observers in the best possible light to reinstate negotiations with the European Union is ready to complete a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-participation of Visa for 40 leading white persons and the erection of certain assets, could be lifted if these choices were considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition they weren't.
'We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the election', Juri Potemkin, the Union's press spokesman for democratic forces, accused of a heterogeneous association of 12 parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stressed by Alexander Milinkiewich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the Pro-Europe movement, as it is important for us to choose the votes, and this is the executive.
If opposition officers are drawn into Parliament, then they are appointed and not elected.
But your entry into Parliament can mean sending time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.'
The opposition is therefore guilty of joining the political party because 'the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in a crisis and we are not reforming ourselves, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election process, does not recognise the election as valid.
It stresses that the number of electoral participations appears too high and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of Minsk's voters) has paved the way for all kinds of manipulation.
Have you noticed that a choice has taken place?, asked the leader of the Social Democrat Alexander Kosulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the elections.
And there will be at least five Members of the opposition in Parliament, and those who are at first in line with the government's proposals.'
The rest of the night falls again over the October place.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased to see their success.
Instruction - From the blood that was resecured
Hema-Quebec celebrated her 10th anniversary yesterday, and her President, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice because Hema-Quebec has become one of the world's safest and most efficient blood banks.
And above all, it has won the confidence of the public, which has been severely damaged by the scandal of the contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, national blood clots managed by the Canadian Red Cross were tested by HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and public dissatisfaction, in February 1994, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey conducted by Justice Horace Krever aimed at bringing light into the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to develop guidelines to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While Richter Krever was still reluctant to present his report, several provinces set up a committee to develop a new system for the management of blood reserves in Canada.
In Quebec, the committee met with Gélineau.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec and the Canadian blood company to provide the other provinces and both territories.
'1998, when Hema-Quebec took up its work, almost 38% of the people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
By the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood reserves and by working in this area over the next few years, we have gained confidence in the public', she says, before she is proud that in early 2008 almost 94% of the Quebec population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that 'trusting is something extremely sinful'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting in accordance with the principle of caution.
At this time we experienced numerous cases of the human form of swine fever in Europe, a new kind of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which has been leading since the founding of 1998.
And we didn't have the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we rely on one of the main policies of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, which follows exclusion measures if one does not know this and if a disease is only slowly advanced, as it is evident in the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is caused by a degeneration of the brain, which leads to the inevitable death.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood was received from persons who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago it was proved without any doubt that this disease will be transmitted through the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution we used has a sense.
1999 appeared on the market a lot more precise technique for detecting HIV: the nuclear acid test (NST), which allows it to directly detect the virus itself in the donor's blood, and not the antibodies against the virus, as it was in the case used.
The NST has been able to reduce the time of incubation between the time when the person was infected and what happens when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
The risk was thus that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and this could not be recognized, significantly reduced.
These improvements enabled the risk of transmission of AIDS through a blood transfusion to a significant extent.
Today, one of 12 million people is at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
In other words, you have to distribute 12 million blood reserves before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec is distributed between 400,000 and 500,000 blood vessels each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurred when HIV was transferred over a blood vessel.
I believe that today you can feel better if you get a blood transfusion or write to restore your health' means the head of Hema-Quebec.
Our challenge for the next ten years is to get the safety of our products.
You don't know what disease can get into the system.
Just last year, the Chikungunya virus was discovered on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects over the blood.
We need to monitor uninterruptedly', Dr. Décary continues, before she emphasizes that hema-Quebec has to provide adequate supplies in addition to safe supply.
"The need increases because the population is old.
Since cancer control treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The overcrowding of the population also affects the blood supply network, which includes only 3% of the population of Quebec suitable for blood.'
In this case, every healthy person who is 18 or older and meets the eligibility criteria can spend 56 days, so six times a year, blood.
On average, 14% of people who make their blood available will not be accepted because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who travel to a country where malaria is spread will be excluded for a year.
With this 3% we create it to get an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of resources are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this network when they become older and cannot spend blood anymore.
It is difficult to convince people to spend blood, but above all to keep them and bring them to become regular donors.
Life is so intense today that you rarely find time to spend an hour on blood donations," laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood saving but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyelids and skin, which are used almost exclusively for serious fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being exchanged at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public kidney blood bank Quebecs.
In the bone marrow, previously considered as biomedical waste, there is plenty of blood in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago we celebrated the installation of our most thousands of kidney blood samples, and we planned to take more than a thousand a year.
'We should probably start at the beginning of next year to make it available for transplantation,' Dr. Décary continues, describing this program as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced that they do not have access to it' because hema-Quebec lacks funds to offer this complex and cost-effective program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact on semi-finals
Montreal's Impact last night, thanks to a 3 to 1 victory (4 to 3 with all towers) against the soundrs from Seattle at the second and decisive game of the fourth final series at the Sapputo stadium, where the overall ratio qualified for the semifinal round of the first USL league.
The middle-field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive tower in the ninth minute of the game.
After a first half-time without a tower for both the one and the other, middle-field players David Testo and Rocco Plantino landed the other encounters for the formation of Montreals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan on the road for the soundrs.
We remember that at the first game of the pre- and replaying game on Friday impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila had introduced a 2 to 1 download in front of Seattle.
In the semi-final, the impact will be measured with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening Thunder was able to balance a 3 to 1 deficit in Minnesota by a 4 to 3 series, but the Whitecaps went into the semi-final round with an overall ratio of 5 to 4 yet.
The impact may have to be compared to the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
Short said - winner by Kovalev
Number 1-trio of the Canadian team is ready to attack the season.
Last night the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Thomas Pleanec and Andrej Kostitsyn led the attack on the Panther from Florida with a storm fire which led to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, delivered two proposals from Plekanec, and Kovalev transformed a pass into this winning game, the fourth of the tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by throwing the only door of the whole shooting.
I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel.'
"It has been too much fixed in the first half of the year," said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he's got the end of the game.
He received a series of orders.'
Charest is on the north
The Prime Minister does not intend to introduce elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest joined Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (Left) tried to be elected in today's election.
'The passage of our last large border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the general assembly of the Liberal Party Quebecs in Levis, where he followed the guidelines.
During his talk, a kind of painting was designed behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of water-powered works, mountain works, by Quebec in 'Google Maps' were taken into consideration, maps, etc.
Large funds such as during the selection period.
To the press, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would abstain from this harvest, even if he admitted that his calendar was very full.
The North Plan is the fourth element of a 'Vision' which the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, namely a 'new economic space' which provides for an agreement with France on labour forces, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although she has been mentioned frequently in the speech of the Prime Minister in recent times, the opening of the north - the northern area at the 49th widest level - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, was limited in explaining why the north was 'a Jewel with enormous potential', but he did not mention a date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the coming projects.
The highest of some views on what could be done more: mainly in water energy, in the forest, but especially in the mountain sector, it benefits from the growth of the coastal countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
The list of Mr Charests then includes 'Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, Titan and even diamonds'.
This "area twice as large as France" is close to us, is in Quebec.
It's not just in our neighborhood, it's in us, he stressed how to show clearly that he's looking for a national base space.
Québec grew up with his connection to the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique Quebecs, the James Boutt.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," he added after he had introduced a thematic break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of the Quebec area, closes a portion of Labrador with which Quebec has already been called, the Prime Minister of the Press said against it.
This is a traditional attitude followed by all governments.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity is offered, I will take this stand on behalf of the Government again', he said.
In addition, `with the climate change we must rethink our vision from the north,' he explained and spoke about the North West Passage, which will be vulnerable throughout the year due to ice pollution.
Before this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is a duty to own this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the Urites, and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would deal very dangerously with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pakistani member of Ungava) have already consulted some thirty communities.
A ministerial committee headed by Benoït Pelletier, which takes an important place in Julie Boulet (transport and land prices), has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity at which 'man will create a common vision'.
The development of the North will continue in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be 'promote, regulated and environmentally sound', he promises.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as whether they were a leader of the liberal prime minister who were before him in the office.
Like the Liberals who were in the office before us, we have been thinking about turning the challenges into new growth and development gifts.
This was one of the topics repeatedly raised on the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the participation by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions taken is to name the power plant of Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout-Studam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, through readage, which has achieved the silent revolution and the restoration of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James book, our party always knew what the future will be," Jean Charest said.
The press against him took on another, this time conservative project, although on the program `Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest points out that its launch was planned for 2012.
"It remains among us, but I have to be there," he confided in his party members what he had gained in those cases.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that it would be 2008 and would certainly not give a choice in 2009, has in fact been able to hold this autumn a choice which he has not yet been excluded from the law.
He stresses, however, that his timetable is full, especially because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a gap between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the Free Party received a platform from nationalist plans, in particular from 'the objectives of the Constitution' which were adopted without further delay: the PLQ requires the recognition of 'speciality Quebecs' in the Constitution.
She also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Round Führer and Remote Reporting Council and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
The guidelines of the North Plan were included by the opposition.
The chief of the party Québecois, Pauline Marois, has re-examined the policy for the development of the North-Du-Quebec which the Landry Government introduced in 2001.
According to it, when it came to power in 2003, the liberal government refused to use it.
If they had done it, 'we would have been much more today', Mrs. Marois judged on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has agreed to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that this is not just a big idea," said the party leader Sébastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who comes back from the holiday today.
Letter - A married country
Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (who Ironie) at the Harper cabinet, was allowed to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'scande' for Canada.
This woman who has led an infinity struggle for justice and deserves all our marvels, so to speak, tells a lot about the people around the Prime Minister, like Stephen Parker himself.
We are here to do this with a government that has not returned home to the Landsman arrested in Guantanamo concentration camp as the only one from all the countries concerned.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was even more young than the things that were supposed to happen to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, gives its word and allows a child soldier under unmanly conditions to live there.
The only one who is committed to a parody of justice to assess the accused's debt.
We call to mind that, in particular, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Law Union are complaining about getting Omar Khadr home in order to achieve a fair process in Canada.
This government also closes its eyes to the folder: It is of little interest that a young adult will certainly be physically broken after so many years of Qual.
We are not aware of this yet, but we are experiencing a fundamental violation of our rights, our freedom and our 'Democraticity' here, this word, which the harp always wears like a flag before it, and that sounds so strangely out of his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen must voluntarily be dealt with, tortured and stopped, entirely according to the virtues of a head of government, who is supported only by the minority (may be entirely minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe to find their health at a party that preachs the thunder, law and order. But they do not see that this government has failed to say what made the call and the future of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is in this mess, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwell Talk by Barrick Gold
In its issue of 17 September, Le Debor published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and follows an enormous logic, that the world's largest gold gain company has tried to open a 'public transparent debate' complaint against six million authors and a small medium-sized warehouse.
If it is agreed that the judges are independent and impartial, they shall not judge the truth, especially in the case of fraud, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely removed by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to drive everyone into the mess, which is to represent one of their opposite opinions.
As the process goes, the authors and publishers of the Noir Canada Book must be given considerable sums to prepare their defence and fight against an army of lawyers who are paid out of nearly the goldmine's indiscriminate pockets.
The tactic of these inconsistencies is often to destroy the defenders in order to force an acceptable solution that makes the opposite side go wrong and also to cut off anyone who is reluctant to take the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have to present her views before the public opinion.
On the contrary, in many countries where Barrick Gold is working, going and giving, debates are usually expressed in Canada by exchange of ideas and not by wordiness.
It would have been enough if the Goldmines had uncovered their books and works and had opened a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent verifications that could have brought light to this issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in the public opinion, and his petitions and letters to support Noir Canada's authors with a hand movement are weighted.
Could Mr Garver explain how he could at the same time pray for a 'public' debate and then also miss out on the opinions of this public?
Obviously, this word includes only the highly paid lawyers in the world of the Vice-Presidents, not the Community of all Canadians, but a very well-defined view of the concept.
In a democracy, even the perpetrators have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public, which supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does this primarily because it condemns the brutal attitude of goldmines.
This public is willing to listen and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that makes many complaints as a nude (in the course of the 'public debate' Barrick Gold has just addressed a request to the authors of Noir Canada in which they request that they no longer use this term...).
Apart from Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and the finding of truth that are fundamental to every democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis for intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that have not happened to the rich companies of this world, who else can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead them by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has been known for a long time to get into the grip of debates and disputes and resolve conflicts.
The uncompromising complaint by Barrick Gold clearly shows that she has no interest in a transparent debate, in contrast with what she does.
This is a loss for the university world, just as it is for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures that limit this type of unfair complaint.
Rescue action for the Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
The Bush administration and the leading Congressmen, Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement yesterday on the broadest economic adjustment plan since the Great Depression of the 30th Century.
The new version of the plan over $700 billion, which will stop the financial crisis that has been causing Wall Street for months, has yet to be adopted by the two congressrooms.
The main ingredients are: better control of the MEPs on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the return of the used public funds, new facilities to increase the number of households seized on the basis of payment discounts, and the right to monitor the holders paid to the senior employees of the supported companies.
U.S. Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republican President, Senator Jude Gregg, delivered yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiations marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective," said the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
'It was all about protecting the real economy and the American people from the Wall Street crisis,' said the Democrat.
`This is the basic point: If we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and the rest of the American's everyday life will be enormous,' said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, from fear of the effect that a new shadow had on the vote of the investors.
The agreed deadline was the opening of the market today.
Both U.S. presidential candidates, who had only recently participated in the negotiations, proved to be more than a sponsor of the agreement, but without forgetting to express their discontent that they must be dealt with in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama was in addition to certain arrangements to agree, in particular those that should enable owners to keep their homes and those that concern the holders of leading employees of the company that was managed by the State.
If you ask the taxpayer to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibleness of certain persons, that is not something you could wish for.
But these measures are necessary' he explained to the US television broadcasters.
When he was asked if he would agree to the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: 'I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
"The guidelines I have read show that this is a matter which we all must be patient and which we can come forward with.
The option of not doing anything is simply not acceptable', he said.
The $700 billion plan is focused on the money of the taxpayer.
It comes 14 months after a crisis that has been solved by the site of an real estate collapse, which led first to the collapse of the risk mortgage loans (subprime) before it expanded into further forms of broader loans (PCAA) and finally ended up in freezing the financial power and in ruining banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican rapporteurs was that last week, the first attempt to unite was to break up.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'gitive' assets of companies should be secured by the government only and not purchased, it is believed that the greenhouse gas should be avoided.
In order to round out the focus angle for all at the Congress, one has also added a provision saying that, if the government should lose this programme within five years, it could raise new taxes in order to retain its capital used.
The new plan foresees the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, which can reach another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved in a renewed vote by the Congress.
In contrast to its aid, Washington receives shares from the supported companies that, in the case of winning dividends, can be sold again when the storm is overrun.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to maintain the immigration procedures relating to the apartments linked to the real estate credits covered by this plan and to lay down additional time limits for the return and recovery to be paid to the leading employees of the undertakings concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the House of Lords to vote on it today, and the Senate then on Wednesday.
Despite all her efforts, she's not sure that her plan will get green light.
In fact, yesterday there were further votes against these projects, both by the Republicans and by the Democrats.
'We don't clearly understand Washington,' said the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Commission, his voters.
Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are involved in asking the taxpayers for cash.
The democratic MEP Brad Sherman, the leader of a group at the Congress called 'the Kukukus of the Sceptiker', presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written us to inform us: We ask the Congress not to be pressured and to carefully consider the path to strike," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we again received evidence that it is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial deployment of the Fortis Bank Group for Euro 11.2 billion (US$ 16.3 billion).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refuse to buy its competitor who is in serious difficulties since it lost EUR 2 billion (US$2.9 billion) in the crisis through the risk of real estate credit in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and belongs to the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurance companies.
'This is no lost money, declared yesterday by Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos.
To balance we get a right of choice and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savings and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announced.'
During this time, on the other hand, the British government was just trying to replace another bank forced by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would receive all current loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which over 41 billion dollars (75.5 billion dollars) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customers of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be after Northern Rock the second bank that the British Government has had to replace since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - The death of a committed icon
His beauty with the blue eyes had long been his noise, nobody would say, his weakness.
Did the American player get rid of the charming smile from the Nazi mirror?
Yeah and no.
His feeling of hatred, his sensitivity and a clear talent may also have kept him from a power that brings him to the world’s most frightening monsters.
But what a great endurance runner!
On Friday, 83 years of age, Paul Newman, who died of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, which he had been like and for a long time was a sort of rival on the Leinwall, more careful in his play, certainly even more serious, but also an apostle of freedom and of the Spring of Dramaturgic Conventions.
The resulting loss of blood often results in wonderful children.
He was born in 1925 in Ohio as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-speaking mother.
From its European roots, one of the vast faces of the American dream should emerge.
Without excessive ego, excellent quality characteristics.
Because in him a whole country once again fell in love with the self-made man, in the fighter who was wounded in the war in the war, studied the beginning of the 50th year of playing art in Yale and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he succeeded in the theatre, television, and soon also in the cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became second in 1979 at the 24-hour race of men, and also a sex symbol, although he had lived with actor Joanne Woodward since 1958 in a preliminary relationship.
With him, the unknown faces of this mysterious, mysterious, engaged, and anti-glamorous star, whose advice will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans replaced the movie lovers this weekend in Taumel, while all his great roles were played on the dark screen of the memories.
More than half a century American film art is constantly changing with it.
Here again, the charming Cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes back to mind, and the young man who returned his sensitive wife (Elizabeth Taylor) to the Catze on the hot flash that was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
It will be called back a much shorter memory (1990) which will wake up to his sensitive Mr Bridge, who will be broken up in his high age by a wedding that did not fulfill all their promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, serial, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A Hand Full of Dreck) by Robert Wise, a role that was thought for James Dean, was re-entered after his death and the Newman was introduced in 1956.
This sympathical Ganove in the wonderful The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded in 1973 with the Oskar for the best film.
The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961),
This face over the time, it was him.
He's still there.
In his life course, seasons are united.
The young man knows him primarily from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox trainer of an Eishockey team.
His fans found him back in 1994 in The Skin Sugar Proxy of Brother Coen.
With a last role 2003 as the patron of the Irish Mafia in Road to Loss of Sam Mendes, the circle was closed.
On the contrary to several cinematics that have returned from the film environment early enough, Newman should stay in the satal for a long time and tell Hollywood, his possessions, his breakfast and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'subplaying' when he assessed his all-expressive performance.
The meteor wasn't always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, which has only been flying for a long time.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotics, alcoholics, feeslings or doubts, with their perfect performance he reflected his duties and wages.
As director, Newman did not know about his real sensitivity.
His wife, Rachel of 1968 (after the Canary Islands novel Margaret Laurence) and his wife, Joanne Woodward, in the capital, drew a fine female portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, devoted this 1984 film to Harry and Son, a work full of affection and sadness.
At the river of honours that took place yesterday about Newman ergoss, his close friend and former gunman Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said: 'His presence has improved my life and this country'.
Greatness and pleasure were essential characteristics of the lost player.
Apart from his legendary career, he is now also a major champion of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of the exploitation of Hollywood.
We may have often seen him with his foot full of grapes, in sauces, bags or other foods, and kept it quite tasteless, although we found it very funny at first.
However, the gains from its transformations flow into its foundation for children in need.
Instead of resorting to his myth, Newman committed himself to the Committee.
He left a letter with these values for his five daughters: "Always and to the end your father was incredibly grateful for his good stars.
It was an honor to be here.'
And it was an honor for us to follow the life of such an intelligent and great American actor.
A exemplary citizen, in the deepest and deepest sense.
What was produced in the accounting factory of Appendix &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the negotiations in the criminal proceedings began against János and his complications.
In particular, the accused is accused of involvement in organised crime, serious damage and fraud, and other criminal acts - including counterfeiting of documents.
According to the government, the funds derived from the statements were used for their own purposes, while the benefits received were often based on false estimates.
State funds and grants from the self-government - total HUF 65 million - will be part of the Fiatal Balodal organisation's cash box, part of the private box.
As informed by the intelligence authorities, definitive calculations were submitted in relation to the auction fees, and the units should not be satisfied with their obligations.
According to the complaint, most of the accounts should be faked.
The billing blocks were sold on the market by Józsefváros, which was allowed to be manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies are to be included in the accounts was decided in the north of the platinum sea on which István Lados was sent by János.
In connection with this "Eclipse Tour", Lados should make up for pensions and restaurants.
He asked for accounts on consumptions to be made available to the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the administration of Budapest on the basis of these proposals.
These calculations should be mostly from István Lados and its complex, András Óri, which should be responsible for the drafting of the relevant reports.
One of the objectives of Lados' "Eclipse Tour" was a beer resort.
As two of the additions and Co accounts issued in 2003 are to be taken into account, the gastronomy operation should have assessed the nine-headed group of the Bistos Pont Egyesulte.
But now there is the head of the company, such a large group would not even fit into the local.
Another account, published in summer 2002, on the establishment Jobb Jötőret, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredtért, also shows serious form and content errors.
In a stay in Badacsonytomá, which has only three rooms and cannot be accommodated at the same time than ten people, 130 guests are expected to have stayed on account.
The fantasy of the accounting frauds was apparently not as limited as it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy operation, in which customer records of Jobb Jööőrter and Hoppá according to the complaint authority do not even appear.
As business leader Győző Farkas of Hvg.hu told him, it was clear to him that it was false documents that had been submitted to him by the government during a survey.
"Our company name and tax number were wrong on the stamp."
And further: Apart from form defects, the fact was also false that the operation should have accommodated hundreds of people after they had total 11 rooms that offer as many people as possible.
It has also been provided in the account, while the restaurant has been no longer in operation for a long time.
The purpose of the billers has also refused to verify that the Budapest travel office taken from them to visitors only offers travel abroad, and thus they have provided Hungarian travel on the payment account, which is also contrary to the company's accounting practice.
As in the case of investigations, they have also included VAT in the calculations, although travel services related to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The amount of VAT was totaled at four of the hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Foundation Jobb Jööhőrt is wrong, since the operation is only 25 per cent VAT. Moreover, only machine bills are issued by employees, but the fake documents were written.
Another error that had been made to the "accounters" was that they had indicated in a case "purport" as a result of performance, although this was not offered by the company specialising in investment advice, the government authorities shared it with.
Other forms of error - false accounting format, false stamp - were to be blamed for the possible withdrawal of the accounts issued by the Egyesület a Harmadik Évezredtért Alapítvány, as well as at XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and Bistos Point as false.
Also in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camper Kunfehértó, whose business leaders claimed that the accounts had never been issued.
Another "failure" is the falscher at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This company was in a resolution at the time (2001) when the Fiatal Városét Egyesület group was to eat there - the mass administrator then suggested that the accounts should not be issued by itself.
Awarely Falsely
The other groups of accountants are people who were well aware that they had to make effective calculations.
At the request of the Fiatal Balldal - Ifjj Socialisták, the Foundation Esély Budapesttér Alapítvány has issued accounts for the Foundation Add a Harmadik Évezredtért, at a level of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the appellant, the director of the Collab Kft. was handed over by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to present the real accounts.
The currently available biogate Kft. will also work together with addendum and Co.: In 2003 the GmbH will provide Jobb Jööőret Alapitvány Foundation, as well as the Association Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with fake accounts at the total value of HUF 5 million, which are related to unencumbered benefits.
However, there was also a small number of payments since the accounts were cancelled immediately after their disclosure, however, what the parties had forgotten in their documents.
The third group of auditors includes persons directly involved with the accused.
One of them is Ivan Kubatov, the postbook of the Ukrainian business leader Delta Trió Kft., who is located in Budapest but is not located there.
This company is expected to have issued several calculations over the period from October to December 2005 on the sale of EDV components in the total value of HUF of approximately 18 million.
According to the intelligence authority, the cash investment Ltd from Kiskunhalas has been operating as buyer of these accounts since 14 September 2005.
The business manager of this company was a Romanian whose company documents should also be assigned by Ivan Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
Kubatov has been informed during the investigation to issue accounts on behalf of GmbH to the Association Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and their present value has fallen.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Ltd. and Jos investment Ltd. should be based on the express desire of Romanian Maureen on Ivan Kubatovs.
In reality, however, none of these companies were active, according to the complainant on missing contracts.
However, he was able to benefit from the company: On the request of his complex, the lawyer Zsolt Sainte, who was responsible for preparing the company's establishment documents, he issued accounts on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with accession, such as Atlasz and Y-Generácó.
In total, Kubatov will issue 15 accounts at the total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The government authorities believe that Kubatov could have paid 10% of the amount of the bill as well as the VAT.
Kubatov should even have missed the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of solid accounts - in this case the calculations have been accompanied by the applications of Bibtos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generáció und Szövetétété awarded its applications at the joint organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints, however, these amounts have been used for purpose.
To exchange this, they have provided the TMA with five fixed accounts of the works team Ltd...
These accounts were also secured during the investigation of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, it is now calculated by some of the defendants with a view to the way in which they have already been dealt with before the government.
A feeling could be if the main complaint by János decided to make a comprehensive decision.
His information so far was less detailed, and although he had already said several times to report comprehensively on everything, his attitude is still evident.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him with regard to the recovery of much of the damage caused by HUF 50 million and whether the aid is prepared to take responsibility.
It is possible, however, that an addition now plays the "adhesive" after its attempts to slow down arrest and house arrest were put on deaf ears.
While other criminals who have caused far greater damage to economic operators and have not paid them, on a free foot or at least under house arrest, the possibility remains denied.
The psychology of the area - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of improvements, the buyers tend to spend more and thus overestimate the offer of error.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York are now able to discover the neurological economic grounds of this famous and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people in a competition like an increase in eBay are not paid and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
Researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto, while the others participated in a gamer action - in both cases, the active brain regions of the samples were examined using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the fight, a complex under the brain, was measured by the loss of the auction, which played an important role in the over-the-counter.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-remuneration" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore felt that the price increase was allowed by avoiding an overreaction of the dispute.
In order to subsidise their thesis, the economies in the research group have also carried out investigations into the follow-up of the money.
In this case, three groups should deal with a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the real value of the product and then made use of it.
In addition, another group was promised a $15 reward for the fact that they were awarded as winners from the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in the case of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was only that the emphasis was on the one on the winning, while the other was on the loss.
As evidence of the hypothesis presented by neurologists, however, the members of the "anti-loss" group were ready for higher applications than those in the "win" control group.
"These results are not based on any previous economic theory.
This is because the behaviour observed during auctions has only been based on the joy of winning, or risk prevention.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved through the creative neurological procedures, so that we have now prepared a third statement," said Andrew Schutter, professor of the University of New York's Department of Economics.
Hepatitis: When is your doctor looking for you?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is diagnosed with leading causes of death.
The number of infected people is estimated at hundreds of thousands in this country, however only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the substance of the collection for various viruses, infectious liver disorders.
The symptoms are often similar - liver pain and stomach pain are common, but the rulers and the diseases differ.
For example, hepatitis B, C and D may be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, skeletal secret or spleen).
Travelers will be advised to have an infection against viruses A and B at any time, and there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms at Hepatitis A show about two to three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, stomach pain and rash.
Then the yellowfish comes up on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine is dark, and the generation can last for up to two or three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from hepatitis B, severe diseases such as liver cancer and liver surgeons.
The main reason for this is that estimates are based on the fact that only every 10 infected person is in drug-free treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have severe consequences: it can lead to liver surgeons and liver cancer without treatment.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the emperor destroys the liver cells domestically - in many cases the first symptoms occur after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular checks on controls, is unacceptable.
There are three groups in which this disease occurs more frequently: those who have undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug dependents and tattoos.
Currently, the number of patients with chronic hepatitis C worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already visible in routine laboratory testing, it is advisable to search the houseuse for the first signs of unknown origin.
At the right time, the disease is healthy, the virus can be eradicated by limiting the risk of infection and preventing cancer.
On September 30, 2004 the World Day of Hepatitis is the first time that patients worldwide are being held.
The objective of the action is to strengthen the awareness of these chronic liver sensations caused by viruses, their occurrence and the importance of early recognition.
Do you believe in less pain?
How recent research results suggest that religious belief works as a kind of "sickness" that should have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have performed an interesting experiment: It has been examined how belief in God affects the pain of man, reported the British newspaper "Telegraph".
In the course of the more strange study, each 12 believers and atheists received electroshocks while studying a painting of God’s mother.
As the results showed, the believers were able to turn off most of the pain.
By means of a brain scan technology, it could even be shown that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain control.
The study was the first in a research project, where scientists also participated in philosophy and theologians from different departments of the university.
During the test, the test was connected to the left hand, which gave off the electroshocks.
The participants were asked to concentrate heavily on two paintings: To one image of God’s mother, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and to another Leonardo da Vincis "Made with Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary among the believers would provoke some kind of religious Transparency, while she chose Vinci's image, because it was hardly different from the other image and was found to be comforting.
The test subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and at this time they received 20 electroshocks in four stages, while both religious or other images should be viewed.
The Catholics reported that they had felt "in security" when God's mother felt as if they were "careful" and had "peace and peace".
In view of the religious image, they reported more than 12% less pain than if they had worked before Leonardos.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the attempt, thought that similar effects could also be invoked with other powerful images in the atheists, but only the appropriate photo could be found.
"We have to find a picture that solves very positive emotions like a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality and do so in many cases," said Wright.
Following these outstanding results, only the question remains what effect a Madonna image of Leonardos or another comparable painter would have on the pain control of the believers.
Would the qualitatively high-quality young woman Maria achieve even better results?
You're what you're talking about.
Due to its tenth birthday, Google can claim with bird and right: it is to find in the pockets of humans exactly how they cross their heads in the sky: You know where people have spent their vacation, what professionals they go to and what they move.
And that's still not enough, says Eric Schmidt, one of Google's business leaders.
In the direction of Skeptiker, who is charged with Orwell Horrorvisions, he can adjust: These would just overlook the main features of the web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently meant that Google's main goal is to collect more personal data about the users and thus get closer to the original purpose of the company, as it wants to "organise all the information of this world".
Schmidt explained that after ten years, Google has been a world-changing work just at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked about the status quo for five years, Schmidt said: he wanted Google to be able to ask such questions as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job is really suitable for me?" but his software programs are not yet able to answer because they didn't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that their Internet research would record the search terms as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his own search process and to return to it later so that events can be generated much more accurately later, and on the same logic, the "Recommendations" are based on what the system recommends by measuring products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users ask themselves what happens in the case of data abuse - "When you watch what I do" - some are concerned about the Google Data Monopole.
In most cases, however, it is the potential power represented by the company that causes fear, and less the feeling of guilt or fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or the appeal against the power that is at odds with many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but are also given to third parties in the event, and there is no protection for the personal rights of the internet user in these cases.
A parade example of this was recently the case against pádophilia in Brazil, where Google of the Brazilian Government provided information collected by the Community site called "Orkut" and also enabled identification of pádophilia.
However, concerned users were able to open up in May when Google, together with EFF's civil law organisation, successfully went against the FBI before the court: therefore, Google can also be forced to issue information to the FBI on a secret request in the future.
( However, the Federal Government has successfully produced the issue of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms under the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but it has kept the list of individual users in relation to their web and search lists in two months.)
Googles Image is therefore still controversial: Those who publish their personal data less because they fear the loss of their private and intimate life through the use of Google services, the company is responsible for the import of their personal data to conservative companies.
In it, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and is a favorite computer fans, activists and users, is the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leaders, even if both fight for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google does not limit its users to Microsoft's identification codes, and makes its services available free of charge so that an open, constantly updated source code and software package is far more attractive, younger and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the Geeks consider the problem relationship between personal rights and the Internet cross-border – a relationship that has been reduced especially in recent years thanks to the concept "Web 2.0" in the middle.
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing else than collaboration, talk about leaving the users on track and benefiting from the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are different individually, the main thing remains the same, i.e. to be seen publicly.
An average young person can simultaneously manage his profile on several Community portals - from Facebook about Yanga, it can connect with other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can finally join a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition they can lead blogs that automatically represent the latest photo gallerys that are placed on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples show: In view of the photos of the party last night, the friend will soon find out with whom she had enjoyed the surprise of her friend, or the employee will be released, because in his blog he only makes his carer about the conduct of the company - one is sure: The term "privatsphere" has been completely reinterpreted.
One who leads an online life is what he prizes himself - so in some way you can form the basis behind today's behavior.
And whoever tries to keep something secret or even to turn on the Google Monopol can do it - like with Scroogle, a tool that can access Google's search engine, but does not leave any traces, however.
Not only are few people registered on community sites so they are not available, but also Google's online applications, such as text processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be used with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and therefore not generate the best profile from the user.
The public opinion is expected to be limited until Google shows its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising areas of AdWords/AdSense are threatening the acquisitions of advertising agencies, and the more rapidly introduced services not only prepare Microsoft but also other software developers to break heads.
However, critical observers also find the disturbing opposition: Thus, the group leadership has completely rejected a protest by the employees after they have been doubled to the fees of the company's children's garden, and the management, which is too costly for the employees to take care of. However, all of this has to be mild despite the fact that Google went into trouble in 2006 before the Chinese government even entered into it and agreed with an agreement, because all the regime-critical events, or those that would be misunderstood against the good taste, would have to be filtered out.
The Group’s internal rules state that there will be no new service in advance, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could confirm a few more strongly: While some of my Google’s books and magazinescan or archiving projects take into account the fact that the company had to be replaced with the Supreme Court soon, others are more concerned about the health system, which allows for the creation of a complete health profile with findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already delivers the substance - about "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes a future in a better way, where a person will be rapidly approaching Google thanks to data.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd in the end of the track
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police now heard two young people suspected of helping with the destruction of the trails, the police officer Borsod shared with him on Tuesday.
The young people were persistent and are now accused of aid.
According to information from the MTI news agency, it is about two girls who defend themselves on a free foot.
Aid shall be threatened with a penalty of up to five years.
The suspect of Ozd's double murder, a 23-year-old local man, was taken to court on Sunday.
The man is under intense suspicion of killing several people out of their lives.
According to the findings, the 23-year-olds owed a higher amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to bear his debts, so he dragged his fellow believers on a land in Ózd, where he and his nine - year - old daughter were killed.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act with a longer hand - this also proves the fact that he has committed the murder with a weapon hidden on the counter.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the tattoos and the conditions of their use.
Warswauer Bürse puts shopping offers for Prague Börse
About EUR 200 million, or 5 billion in Czech krones, has offered the Warsaw stock exchange for the hundreds of purchases of the stock packages of Prague stock exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Börse, confirmed the offer that Poland had made despite the fact that they had previously been excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their bruse.
The reason is that the Warsawn Burse belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, who, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the paper in the coming months.
According to reports of the Czech daily "E15", Poland's bids included the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Börse.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Viennan Börse, Nasdaq Transatlantic, New York Stock Exchange, London Börse and Germany Börse have made offers.
Peter Koblic, chief of Prague Börse last week, said that all interested parties would probably be the worst new owners, and he also did not conclude that this could lead to the end of Prague Börse in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of Prague Börse to 5-10 billion kronen.
According to the shareholders' agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of Prague Börse is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent participation followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In its ever-increasing international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers are already speaking on Tuesday from "second 11 September".
The global financial disaster has made it possible for us to thank the President of the United States for the fact that "La Repubblica" - the President - had not even been able to join his own party for the draft legislation, which should lead to some deterioration in the prevailing situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billions of investors Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11th".
Part of the press in Madrid is also located in Washington.
In the view of El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now at the edge of the collapse.
The U.S. financial system is threatening to break up more and more, and the whole world is going to suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in the Congress, the risk is that Washington has not prepared any political means for crisis management.
The world economy depends on the air, and even at one point, as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
You can't leave the threat out of your mind anymore, which means some of the genres "day indicators".
While some countries may still have their money institutions placed in their shops, savings packages could be made available and banks could save the money of the taxpayer before the bank.
However, a domain effect will be eliminated and more banks will be questioned, and then no further financial or other immediate action will be taken.
For a long time, EU Member States had to jump over their shoulders and centralize control over monetary markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid to vulnerable financial institutions, the Viennan "The Standard" reminds us. Moreover, the newspaper continues to be more realistic that the Americans now have to take European taxpayers into their pockets a little bit deeper in order to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not been seriously involved in the crisis, which now covers the old continents as a tsunami.
Although the "retter" did not have to "wrestle" with several hundred billion euros immediately, it would be advisable, however, to determine in which case it would be reasonable to take the money of the taxpayer in order to avoid further damage.
Intelligent car mimics the flight of the Hummel
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to prevent accidents if you didn't imitate the barriers sensors from nature?
For example, those of the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented to inspire Nissan engineers of Hummel when creating new emergency systems.
In cooperation with the Tokyo University, Nissan built the biomimetic system controlled by autobots by type BR23C, equipped with the properties of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that prevents any collisions.
In the flight, each bee forms its own "private area", which is very similar to our own "protection child", said Kazuhiro Doi, Product Manager for Technology-PR and Research Development at the exhibition.
The combined eyes of the bees, which can be seen in any direction and in an angle of over 300 degrees, play an important role.
In order to take into account the function of the composite eye, researchers are attacking the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a 180 degree face field within 2 meters, calculates their removals and sends signals to the micro-processor on board which immediately leads the collusion-defensive process.
The barrier is recorded in seconds of break, and the autobot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees by turning the tyres around the corresponding angle.
In contrast to existing systems, this manoeuvre is purely instinctive.
"If it wasn't so, the autobot could not respond quickly enough to eliminate the obstacles," Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the autobot project.
The system must respond in instinct and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the inner and most vulnerable part of the shield - a shield, which, in the present case, is still considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they escape other bees.
And that's gonna take a second.
However, the deviation, in contrast to the bees, can not go up, down, or even diagonally - it can be only two-dimensional, but only in the direction of the windability of the tyres.
While there are still many opportunities for the bees here to escape other bees, the researchers were able to operate only on the autoboats, in relation to speeding and braking.
BR23C contains Lithium polymer batteries which are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life span than normal Lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent response, and less to the processing of data, and less to the ability to store them.
This device must only process some inputs per second and respond accordingly.
It does not have to store this, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction through previous manoeuvres, so it takes only a handful KB memory in demand.
There is no need for Gigabyte and Megabyte hard memory.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collition prevention technology that will be in production in the next ten years, following the assessment of Nissan.
Another application could find the technology at GPS satellite navigation by putting the driver aware of obstacles to it and leading him to this end.
A name for the rendered child
Now the written version of the 700 billion-dollar rescue package legislation, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at the purchase of the bank's bad credit.
The first step is to issue half of the money.
At a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight at the Eastern Coast, after several days of debate, the congressmen had reached an agreement over the 700 billion-dollar heavy rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, a democratic president in the U.S. House of Commons, and thought that the agreement should only be made on paper.
The successful compromise on the rescue package was supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said the result: The program will be effective and it will be effective, but there will be more to be done. According to Pelosi, it was not about the salvation of Wall Street but about the collapse of the economy.
The written version of the package was published even before the opening of the Asian markets, so Washington Time Sunday at 8 a.m. (Central European Time Monday 2 a.m.), but no high-speed flight was released on the bridge.
On Monday, the House of Lords agrees on the draft legislation for the stabilization of the economy in 2008, then the Senate is on the line.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House.
However, the programme is weighted by the original recommendation of the Bush Administration, which is why the $700 billion on one occasion for the purchase of counterfeiters should be issued with securities charged.
In one first instalment, half of the 700 billion bill is to be issued at the maximum, with 250 billion available immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday. This sum is to be used for the purchase of credit charges, bad securities, and the President will decide on the next 100 billion dollars.
The programme shall be reviewed by a Commission itself, which shall also belong to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of 700 billion depend on a further decision of the Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combination of tactics: at the same time, it can buy bad credit, mortgages, and mortgage-based securities, or other "significant" credit.
As competent persons in the Ministry reported, the purchase can be carried out both in an auction and directly.
The law enables the undertakings concerned to participate in an insurance programme guaranteeing the financial resources concerned and to pay the companies the fees for the damages to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to 700 billion dollars can be made available as immediate aid to the US financial system, whether it is for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk that will be solved by the collapsing of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law once it has been signed, as Paulson said.
However, the heads of banks affected by difficulties and now allocated to state aid can count on the government to cut off their skills called "Golden Handshake" in the Oversea Slang.
A reduction of the holders will be given only in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance will help each time.
The cut means essentially that if the ministry buys in the course of an auction, so the "Golden Handshake" is paid, it is because the outgoing bank chief will be transferred to the pension.
In the case of direct purchases of counterfeit credit, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the manager holders are not exceeded.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions are only related to new agreements, so that more people are involved in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts are regulated by law by managers, commented Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Committee, the measure.
The State gains the right to participate in participating banks so that the risk for taxpayers is reduced, as they can also participate, as soon as it improves the economy and also the managed bank.
The draft legislation provides that the President must submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years on how the taxpayers should return their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were also some skeptics who challenged their doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens expect from us, the plan does not necessarily protect the taxpayer's money, as is the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Captur, said: The measures were taken by the same people who are also responsible for the Wall Street campus.

No more visas in the United States since 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the United States-Hungary visa agreement to enter into force on the 12th of January, as the Foreign Minister said before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
Your view is "depends only now on whether the electronic immigration relationship control system will be introduced oversea at the right time."
However, she also stressed that there will be no travel permit in the new system, but the tourists had to register in advance.
The leader of Hungarian diplomacy is currently leading negotiations in Washington.
She also meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will take over the "Middle Service Cross with Stars" of the Republic of Hungary, and conducts talks with the foreign political advisers of Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates of the major US parties, have expressed their support for the 700 billion dollar heavy rescue package for banks on Sunday. However, there are also politicians who demand the withdrawal of the Minister of Finance.
The Congress and representatives of the government announced that they had come to an agreement on the bank rescue package after certain Marathon consultations had been held on Sunday.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the rise in the embedded credit market, have been the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claimed to be better suited than any opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
Following recent questions, Obama was able to further develop its origin thanks to the economic issues, while McCain's High, which has protected him from the presentation of Vice-Presidentship candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, has also failed.
At a election campaign in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress would soon adopt the law of over 700 billion dollars in heavy packages.
He stressed that the plan also included the consumer protection passports that he supported.
"We must act now, and as responsible (...) - your jobs, your savings, all industrial sectors, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened," he said before 35,000 observers.
He didn't fail to name McCain's economic visions as "obsolet".
In an interview given by ABC, McCain stated: "We will all have a hard time choosing (...) but no alternative is specified".
The Republican senator said that the plan also proposed the establishment of a control committee for the Minister of Finance, as well as the limitation of the tasks for top managers - something he had been able to do.
The CBS said Obama, McCain had no definitive role in the negotiations, although he, Obama, was in contact with the Minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the draft legislation on Monday.
Print the German language
The right layer is intact, only the voters have become aware within the warehouse - so "The mirror" comments the weak performance of the CSU in Bayern.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to manage to prevent a red-black coalition.
Mirror (spigel.de)
In the online issue of the left German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic fall of the CSU in his article "Bayer's Revolution tells her father".
According to the renowned politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the tragic Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over his office.
The Christian Socialists have been renewing Bayern over decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
At the same time, the dawn is a problem of Christian democracy as well as for Angela Merkel.
Not surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU didn't come to an end, but on Sunday something has happened, however, which has already been mentioned just ten years ago: the undisputed hegemony of a State party.
Because, ten years ago, 1998, the CSU was 47.7 per cent, and this was the first time since the fifteenth year of the fifty-percent mark.
This was repeated three years ago during the federal elections in 2005, which is still in the many so-called Stoiber-Ára.
The modernization carried out by the CSU in Germany has been good enough for their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this over 40 years ago, but had lost its weight at the time. However, without any impact on the credibility of the CSU voters, the consequences of education, the transition from East and North Germany to the prosperous regions of Bayerns.
Modernization always goes hand in hand with an increase of options, and that has political consequences.
The right warehouse is intact - only the voters inside the warehouse have become more critical and self-sustained.
It is interesting that during the last few weeks, the classic groups of citizens have spent the greatest distance on CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with abictures such as high school graduates.
Here the support of the CSU fell by less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Wiener daily newspaper reports in its "Who With Whom? Participating in Coalition Questions" articles on the chaos in Austria after the election.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the OVP.
The OWP prohibits the mixing of SSP in internal matters.
The BZÖ is open to discussions in all directions, while the Greens do not want to establish a coalition yet.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about the coalition; in the debate on public-law television, the party leaders hardly look at their cards.
SPÖ-Chief Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the OVP.
The SSP wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very possible - in some German countries and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question of whether he could present himself as a coalition with Wilhelm Multer, the current head of the OVP as a vice-president, was open to Faymann.
As he said, the voters had chosen the course of shielding.
A repetition of this direction is not in question.
More people have responded carefully to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tries to interfere with the internal facilities of the OVP.
Whether his party is in opposition or goes into coalition, he is now fully open, and these issues should be discussed within the OVP.
BZÖ Chief Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to take up government responsibility," said Haider.
Járóka: The devil circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European summit has begun on equal opportunities, which will be addressed by the EU Presidency of France.
In her speech addressed to the Plenum, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz Group of the European People's Party, particularly the education segregation, focused on the most serious legal damage to Roma children, and this would be the greatest obstacle to their enforcement.
The high-level conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Council, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, and the most important European legal and civil society organisations in the area of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the EP officers of Fidesz, Járóka pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in the search for employment, the Roma would first be deprived of their low levels of education from the labour market.
"The vast majority of the Roma youth have no secondary education, and only a small part of them can reach a university degree through poor basic education."
Járóka further stressed that education is a fundamental human right that has a key role to play in the creation of other human rights.
Investments in early training of Roma children can strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
From the point of view of the MEPs, it is important that this relationship becomes known as a widest circle - so Rome and non-Romania.
Because as a Roman student starts the school, his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market are increased, and through income and consumption tax, they contribute to national expenditure.
"As a citizen of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the bad and segregated education must be introduced," says Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member has stated, a joint, targeted and action-oriented process of the European Union is needed to speed up the de-governmental process in the education sector, which is essential for the proper implementation of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break the devil circle from poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as a full-time citizen," Járóka asked.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit is held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the achievement of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European but also national levels, within the meaning of "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Gifts in Time
At the end of October, it will be decided on the shipment of the fallen duos Huber-Beckstein
Despite the electionback, no heads still roll, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the personal debate was forgotten.
Mr Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein are still in their offices, the question is just how long these favors last.
On the final October of the special day of the special day, the fate of the Tandem after the disastrous 17-percent loss of vote will be decided on the fate of the Tandem.
However, the very closed duo has already been able to see that it does not want to hang on her sexes.
In this way they want to deal with the increased group and the party base that called for a day after the "baeric Tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority of the individual consequences.
Five years ago - given under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career point - the Christian social union still reached 60.7 percent. However, one year after the Portuguese against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of the votes were saved.
The CSU has been "alleging" in Bayern for 46 years, the 18 percent of the German GDP.
While the conservatives remain the decisive force in which the Hungarian economy is also important to the south, they will have to be governed in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the internal restructuring, the potential successor Hubers, Vice-President and Federal Minister Horst Seahofer will also be included in the research team, which will lead to a possible Munich coalition of law-enforcement "Free voters" in relation to the legal basis.
An irony of the delivery hall is the same as that of Gabriele Pauli's list of "Free voters" which has been included in the legislation, whose anti-Stoibers have used the Huber-Beckstein Duo first to serve the target politicians without any reward.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its forces on stabilization of Becksteins.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has been behind the feet for as long as he left the back, will play an active role. On 28 September, the former Prime Minister and CSU President named "the most important day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made a couple of toxic remarks towards CDU - his view was that the CSU would deserve much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the download as a signal to the CDU and therefore also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has also contributed much to national success in 2005, is not to be placed on the legs again with a common force, markers after the German election in September 2009 cannot be re-cancelled.
Merkel, who has not made a cure from her disappointment over the Fiasco, believes that the loss of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
However, what is relatively different is: the injured CSU will not be able to manage more easily, and the crisis of the social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best results in Bayern since 1946.
Lukaschenko-Opposition: 110-0
At the Sunday elections there was no MEP in the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is in the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko, however, the OECD suspects legal difficulties in voting.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
The legislation of the 10 million inhabitants of the country has been without opposition for decades. However, the opposition party gathered under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) has seriously hoped that Lukaschenko, who, in the context of the unsanitary elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment of 2006, would have renewed his presidency's mandate for the fourth time, this time by some of the opposition's members in Parliament.
That is why the ODS has even taken away from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly dependent on increasing prices for imports of gas from Russia.In order to reduce price increases, even loans have been included, and the country has also approved the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading through the country.
For temporary relaxation, the OECD's evaluation report provided an assessment of the elections, in which emphasis was placed on positive movements, rather than on weaknesses - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's quick report has already criticised the campaign on Monday - therefore opposition must not be in the press - and in particular the fact that opposition must not be present when voting.
Nevertheless, the opposition is able to recognize an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been placed on a stand-alone basis, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to recognize the independence of the remote Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on paper, which has been considered independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and we have made a comeback, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started," Alexander Milinkewitsch said to our page.
In view of the opposition candidates for the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to continue, although "the powerful fear has been given to leave only one opposition in Parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest measures in view of the results, but rather seeks to clarify the need for economic reform for voters.
"We have had many problems here - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us on the road when selling stones, but I still see that more and more people support the change, even the older ones," Millinkewich said, reflecting that not even the current pensioners' layer with the Lukaschenko regime, their only service is social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in trade deficit, it is only a matter of time until the "social security" of a peaceful building begins to break up," says Milinkewitsch.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers have designated the elections as democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe in acts, not words." The lack of opposition is therefore proof of the rise of white voters.
Brunetta: "From now on it's breakfast before work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are portable doors for the entrances and exits of the officers.
From now on, the action will be taken against those trappers who stop first and then drink coffee during working hours.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister for Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers.
">"Strengthenable doors are a means of increasing labour efficiency through a higher presence quota and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," Brunetta stressed once again.
The Palazzo Chigi will end the use of all buildings of the Council of Ministers.
Masi means "the choice of the portable doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no opposition from officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process has been supported by all those who have come from all sides."
All in all there is therefore no breakfast during work time anymore; closing with coffee or croissant .
Brunettas says about this with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonderful".
During a meeting of the Committee of the Opera of the Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Administration)
From Rome, the Minister reports that "in three months, the absences of officials have reduced to 50%, which means that 60,000 people are more active each year at work".
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration
"their pay dynamics - so the Minister - have been double in the last 8-10 years as large as the private sector and far beyond the inflation rate".
Among them are thousands of officials working together to reverse the Brunetta Decree in the framework of the codacons-supported call.
"While the Minister for Public Service is profiled by numbers of fewer absentee workers - says the consumer centre - the people are growing in 'actual wage'.
In fact, thousands of right and valuable officials of the public service have gathered together to explain the illegal standards of the decree to the war."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) will be fighting additional financial imbalances for work-related illness; the planned extension of the compulsory home leave of the sick worker, during which controls can be made and further aspects of the Minister's renewals will be introduced.
Napolitano: "The prevention of accidents is crucial"
Every day in Italy 2500 accidents occur, three people die and 27 live with disabilities.
For 2007 the data of the Inail (Istituto nationale contro gli infotruni sul lavoro) confirm that the deaths occurred at about 1200.
These figures are the severity of a phenomenon, which almost doubles the number of deaths caused by murder.
Today, the Anmil (Associación Nazione Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will be held in all provinces of Italy on the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work in order to link the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data spread by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention is at work," confirmed the President of the Republic of Georgia Napolitano in his communication to the President of Amil (Associatione nationale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its "great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of work, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of victims' families and the awareness of public opinion".
"An imported "Basta" has risen on it; of course, when tragedies, which, measured by its size order, solve some fears in the media and the public's participation. However, everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even be repeated in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is also a resource problem: it must be invested in education and information."
A particular importance is attached to the numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness-raising in schools by young people who are eating the world of work.
It is our duty to pay attention to these phenomena and not to lose sight of their social seriousness. We must put a legislative standard in place and improve.
On the other hand, the President of the House Gianfranco Fini stressed "as the phenomenon of forced deaths is a pressing social necessity, which strengthens the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on certain rules aimed at ending the problem".
"The data on labour accidents appear to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not rule out that the number of fatalities at work is too high," said President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes tragedy at the end."
"How do you believe that you take too little action to prevent the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight it by various actions.
Stronger controls and inspections are what we think is necessary – so Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to clarify the workers who are already in school.”
"An additional effort is needed - so it adds - as regards communication and awareness-raising of public opinion.
But above all, there is a greater feeling of responsibility from the employers' side against a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli also spoke of "the progressive deterioration of the protection for the victims of unemployment" and stressed the "recovery of the social system which we have been fighting over in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the employer a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident does not depend on voluntary or incidental expenses decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 player under charge: Risk of hearing damage
Sound music about a longer time span with portable music devices, such as MP3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is a report by the European Commission, which, in a report published today in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Csseri (Scientific Committee on Current and Soon-Identified Health Risks) of the EU.
"From the report – this is what it means in a comment – it is clear that 5-10% of those who listen for at least five years per week more than an hour a day with portable music devices risking permanent loss of their audience."
"I am concerned that a large number of young people who usually place portable music devices and phones on a high volume of sound, without knowing it, do not harm your audience," said Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – so it is called from you – there is a clear risk that is going to be too fast.
What really counts is to sensitize consumers and make this information public.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
In view of the widespread use of portable music equipment by young people, Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee.
"Scientists - including the EU communication - confirm that you are rightly concerned and that your Commission will now examine the necessary measures to protect children and young people from noise coming from portable music devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB. Concern about damages that may result from excessive noise.
These damages can be very limited, in which solutions such as reducing the volume and length of noise exposure can be taken.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of you points out that when users of portable music devices hear only five hours of music a week (less than 89 decibels) so that the legal limits which apply to the maximum noise level at work are already exceeded.
Those who exceed this limit risk the complete loss of the audience within five years.
That is why 5-10% of users of such devices can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gives the start-up committee to the "Commission for the Future of the capital"
We start today, in March it's going to be over, and in June balance will be taken.
This is the start of the work of the "Commission for the Future of the capital of Rome" set out in the chapter.
In six months, President Marzano and 49 other members of the Commission will prepare the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the city and the Community Council will assess the analyses and projects to be able in June to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the capital and of the Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," points out Germanno. "It will make proposals for a development plan for Rome, which will remain politically responsible for the city and the Community Council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where you can develop a large project for Rome.
In March their task will be completed and the Commission will be reopened as such a project needs to have a certain time limit.
In June - as announced by the Mayor - we will introduce the strategic plan in which we will take advantage of the work carried out by the Commission."
Those who question the Commission's competence because their opinion is binding on Germanno, "All depends on the work which the Commission is doing and on the quality of its proposals.
If she, like the Italian Commission in France, gives quality results – and this will certainly be in Rome – then her contribution will be fundamental.
The policy often deals with the everyday problems and accidents that arise from time to time.
On the contrary, we want a longer period of time to work with this in a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city."
The Mayor Romes places great importance on clarifying "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a joke: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roma citizens a cent and will bring us to think about it. It will be the best head of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan which is neither hermetically nor static to enable our city to have a quality source - which it really needs - and thus to take a joint step towards the future".
A future such as the Mayor of Rome, who "not only is limited to the current municipal borders but will be seen much further," not only as a Metropole and political capital of Italy, but also as a future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here's a statement
A well-known American politician, who has much to do with being considered independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American President.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, demeaned the US economy and weakened relations with the oppressed Islam (and this still does as a private man)".
The attacks against Obama are becoming more and more intense, just now, where the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very angry: he thinks he will get the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!".
However, these attacks do not have much to say; it is racist attacks and they do not answer the election question: will he be a good president? And then there are also the questions; everyone says Obama will win with a great advantage.
In this case too there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the southernmost part of the United States, has written in its editorial: first we will know who the real American patriot will be.
Here comes a mentality of the United States which has been kept hidden until last.
"Tell me what you want, then we'll decide who we're going to do for Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
Something you've never heard before – just now where the success of the black candidate seems so secure.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What error did Bush make during his official period? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America's changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a meeting in the back.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weakness.
He who takes his place is in front of a huge task.
U.S. The financial collapse leaves its traces also with journalists: In the newspapers the cuts can already be sprayed. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control about the future.
Today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they stated that they were not really concerned about the information about officials because of general credibility.
They don't feel as lonely as they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems are caused by the cuts in the newsroom, so the space in which the editors work to combine the newspaper.
It is a problem that has to be solved – so the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the big audience understands it, does not significantly spoil it.
A clearer but complicated pessimism is filling the American journalist today.
Six of the ten journalists and executive seniors of the press are of the opinion that journalism is on the wrong path at national level.
In the local area, there are even 65% of executives.
Printed by Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine where the web is headed.
The main publishing groups are the way into the Internet, which is seen by many as the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" that journalists fear is rising to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have agreed to join the new technology in the hope that "they will bring something good for journalism".
The largest rice is in American journalism today between the chief editors of the newsroom and the reporters working for it.
56% of the chief editors at national level are sure to share their values with them while only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with "safety at work".
Business leaders who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
There are 30% of the journalists.
The theme of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", etc. Red.) is always a topic in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a large nation like the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV broadcasts and Internet operators, employers offer them what they like and so it will be a question of take it or leave it.
The chief editors often receive very high loans, however, the editor can only receive EUR 10000 per month, for rent and insurance payments.
As far as the holiday is concerned, the matter will be complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so much after the third, to reach a certain number of holidays after a certain number of years.
But U.S. journalists will often "kick" in the course of the year.
It's a climate question.
UNIPOL: GERricht IN ROME: DANilo Coppola BLEIBT IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the second court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaud, has decided to reject the application of the real estate owner, who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It shall be determined against Coppola because of Bankrot in the context of the investigation into the dispute agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was turned into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked him to allow the real estate owner to be transferred from the province to a apartment in the capital.
According to the Court, he could have been given the opportunity to influence his company and to obtain evidence against him.
The Elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago when the board of directors voted against the 700 billion dollar savings package of the White House: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms the strong release of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis in progress spreads the Republican party, which increasingly plays in its old and moderate East Coast seals, which has always benefited the state institutions and business community and those neo-conservatives who are "who in Washington" and the financial world are hostilely opposed, and so on in the south and the centre of the electoral states.
This part of the party is grateful for its rise, i.e. the vote of those I mentioned above.
This example is, however, only a small part of the major changes that announces or even represents the current economic earthquake: not only in the United States, but also in the whole West and may also be affected by this.
Both in the countries and in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the long-dear events that finally take place and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the discovery of the state's unfavourable renaissance in connection with a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a downturn of banks and financial institutions that have close ties to the outside and at the same time manage a small amount of private funds that live in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for governments: that is how it applies to the families concerned, which is also an enormous majority of voters.
Thus, the crisis appears to be global economical, political, but it is almost national.
Political internationalism thus seems to be justified and have lost its right to speak: the clear evidence for this has been given by the EU, which, because of its division in various national and international conflicts, does not find a common way.
So now everyone is counting on the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, etc. Distribution of aid funds: since the crisis has become increasingly serious, only the United States has been able to save without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimisation to use them: so two conditions are not too extreme – under certain circumstances – which otherwise no international organisation or market can be recovered in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, in the rest, in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that is being attached to the economy with a closely linked sector: territoriality.
Paradoxic way it is right now that we were so convinced that as long as we were involved in a networked society, in a range of always differentiated technologies, the material that we need to identify once and for all, how our future will depend more on the essential material things: water, iron and oil.
While all of these can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the world, they are nevertheless connected to an extremely well-defined piece of land – a territory.
Therefore, it is for the benefit of the one who has access to such a territory to another who lives in a land free of contamination, waterless or oil-free area.
I am now coming to the second news, which, however, requires a short shift.
Who's territory, who's government, who's saying politics, that's what Leadership says.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to create two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for leadership, so the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of equipment on the existing guidelines, i.e. those of the economy that have emerged as insufficient and full shadow zones.
Finally, there is an even more profound and disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an intolerance, an image of inefficiency, a sense of distance that is directed at a whole class of managers of the Western countries.
So it seems that the conviction among large parts of the population is that it is not just the actions of the social elite, but already their ideal world, their way of life, their culture in the farthest sense of the word, their attitude is always foreign and superior.
The demand for Leadership is therefore undermining a weakened but powerful movement of the power of the leading class and of the traditional political institutions. This is reflected in the unprecedented "revolve" of the voters and in the undisputed change in the collective mood of the last time: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bayern, over the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, to the rebellion of the American agents against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the rights in Italy also plays a role).
One gains the impression that the old elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rhythms, journals, intellectuals, some would say their format, more understanding problems, and therefore less representative value with regard to what is going ahead today in the lower social layers of the West and further strengthened from the financial crisis and up to overdimensionality.
In view of all of this it would be wrong to speak of a "rebellion of mass".
But keeping your eyes wide open is not safe.
The super climber that lets you go up on the walls
The forces of gravity are thanks to a fuel and walls can climb like Superman.
This is the subject of four U.S. research centres, one of which is now likely to reach the target.
With an area of just 2.5 cm, it was possible for the researchers to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a narrow wall.
The STUDIO – has an American magazine, published the results of researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material found by the research team is a further development of the fuels already used, which is a particular carbon structure called carbon nanometers.
"The principle of the dresser can be described as a series of spaghetti-adjusted pipes," says Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the feet of the gecos, which are covered by microscopic forces that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with different materials such as Glass Teflon and sleep paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the ability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "let them get rid of the wall without problem", says Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton University of Engineering.
"This material could be used as an accessible material," adds Liming Dai.
Or how to take Spiderman to walls? Perhaps already, however, researchers think more about less fascinating uses, such as the connection of electrical devices, because nanometers are also leading to heat and electricity.
Further areas of application could fall within the area of space travel.
So for the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
The other type of research – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of club.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, California scientists present a substance from microphases that cleanses itself like hair by moving on a surface itself from dust and thereby maintains a perfect bond.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription: Never take fruit juice
Precautions for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed by their refreshing quality and their vitamin content, etc. in the summer, can cause serious health damage if they are taken with certain vital medicines, as they can affect their intake in extreme ways by the body.
David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, once again points to the risk of packaging as well as fresh fruit juices related to drug intake. During the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he once again warned: A glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is sufficient to reduce the intake of certain vital medicines so that they are practically eliminated and thus the health of the patients is threatened.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of certain medicines such as antibiotics, antithmatics, cardiovascular medicine, anxiolytic and neurological agents up to toxic levels.
Medicines Agency for Medicinal Products for Human Use has warned doctors and patients two years ago about the dangers of this mixture and stressed that they should be aware of what should be done with medicines such as diazepan or methadone.
ES IS NOT only GRAPEFRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can be taken with medicines.
The list of active substances hidden by fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of Statee di Milano University: "This results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international producers who are so free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to read the package leaflet regularly and, if there are any unclears, not to ask a pharmacist or a doctor," the expert of the Ansa Agency stressed.
Economic Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The economic Nobel Prize is at the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the possession of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and external policy.
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the day of the Enron Summit, Krugman had claimed in a leading article in the New York Times that this second event was more decisive in the history of the United States than the expectations.
A forecast that did not get a little polemic as an answer and kept the economy a few years later, but today it is completely correct.
"I am amazed and also shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals has disappeared from the public field in the context of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economy of great value", but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style which is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, third version of the "Anti-Micro" package
The day of the publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 came; the Open Source Software won as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office a growing number of users, both at home and at the office, both among freers and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which are monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents some news to the public: in addition to a revised and now partially designed start menu, it is now achieved on a basis of secured compatibility with Apples operating system Mac OS x, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, which means the latest standard ISO version.
Eight of them have also been added to the compatibility with Microsofts Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interestingly, there are some new features, such as those that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates e-mail delivery. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into the graphics editor module and also to save the original appearance image of the page.
This allows you to generate "hybride" PDF files that expand the typical graphics of the Adobe format on the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the best elements of applications: Tables can now be processed by different users by preventing conflicts when changes are made; in the case of the text processing system, each processor will be assigned a break to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are just about to publish various functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result will be published in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. So it follows the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request you can send the installation CD home or office.
If the cost-freeness can be a response to the distribution of the program in the private budgets, it is also in the area of the business where OpenOffice could reach the large firm: in the end, various public administrations and schools have already been transferred to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training offer, which means optimal assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice is composed of five main components: Writer, the word according to text-setting program; Calc, the table program that aims at a destruction of Excel; Imprint, to create presentations such as powerpoint; database for the operation of databases instead of the known access; and finally draw, a graphics module.
The goal for the year 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded by 3 million and 600 thousand people who have already reached it.
Also carbon tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
It opens up a new doping case within the framework of the previous Tour de France: it is about the Austrian sporter Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who as a third-class winner and winner of the tricot of the best climber.
The news published the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old coal from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver who was tested positive on Cera, the third generation era. This was already met by the Italians Ricardo Rico and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The blood samples of coal are among those that have been carried out in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay Malabry laboratories.
If the tests confirm the positive results on Cera now, the Austrians will lose their third place and will be excluded from the race for two years.
The head of the French Anti-Doping Commission, Pierre Bordy, confirmed the positive eposite, and announced by the Associated Press also the Austrian officials.
The 26-year-old Austrians moved behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans on the podium and also claimed the tripod of the best climber for themselves.
COVER SUBJECT: THE NEW YORK TIMES: IS IT ITALY RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the only country of immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which will only be included with opposition.
Does this come from the Belgian nation of racists? This asks the New York Times in a long article dedicated to racism in Italy and from the case of the young man, Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month after he had bought a package.
The case shows what the times are called "paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and employment opportunities" are found, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrantist feelings and the highest support of the Lega North is to be recorded".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the times are characterized by further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the League against immigration and the speedy designation of illegal immigrants will also be introduced as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement which also emphasizes the pope and the president of the state: "Giorgio Napolitano invited the pope at a meeting on the Quirinal to work together between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 euro per room high rental prices
The market for apartments for students does not know any crises.
According to the last survey of Sunia, the rental company, a single room can cost up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken very heavy trains. All the students' skills lose their right to study because their families are not able to support them in this way," said Sunia’s officials, Laura Mariani – "in these cities, there is a great demand from students for a deformation of the market that has also damaged the other residents.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of damages: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limits, unauthorized leases.
For Sonia, it is necessary to adopt exceptional measures that lead to lower rental prices by processing the tax.
A more accurate consideration of the study shows that in Milan a sleeping place is needed in the Brianza Square, about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (at the Black Band) and ends with 800 euros in the 4th Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or almost 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, an average sleeping space is 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students focus on the university's districts, there are 250/280 euros for a sleeping room of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome the prices are located in the squares around the unit at about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bedroom in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rentals in the squares around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who are weighted in outdoor areas can save money: 300 euros for a place of sleep and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, centocelle and similar rooms.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a bedroom, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive quarters, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Amini.
In Bari it costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities the prices are lower, but they have a higher weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting is more common to non-European students, as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rental that is 25-30% above average is required by foreign students.
Looking back to the old cinema Paradise – the cities close their historical cinemas
The historical cinemas are closed because of the favored multiplexquinos.
"A city without cinema is a blind city like a face without eyes."
This image of Director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening right now in the great city centers of Italy, as well as in the provinces.
The process of delimiting the kinos, which began with the birth of the great multisale complex in the Periphery, means long-term view of death for the one-alkino in the center. A process that not only appears inconceivable and irrevocable but also leads to the practice of cultural crime.
Most historical places are full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with whom one has turned a piece of street full of emotions back," says the director of the film "New Cinema Paradiseo", who introduced him 20 years ago the Oskar and the great price of Cannes. It's about the history of a city cinema and its nostalgia, which is what it means to live in a well-lossed movie.
The numbers that Anec, the central trade union, has provided are clear language: in the last five years, there have been a total of 316 traditional cinemas to be closed; these characters paid most of the cinemas in large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions include the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost kinos, followed by the Toscana with 44 and the Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main perpetrators are the multiplexkinos, because it is just these three regions where the largest number of these modern cinemas have been registered: with 195 in the last five years, the Lombardei lists, 81 there are both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful that new structures also occur, but firstly, the acquisition of the existing, because it closes a hall in the city, not all of its native customers are willing to search for an old multiplexkino in the Periphery.
And here there remains the lack of state aid for the fund of the trade union abroad: the debt charged by the State is about EUR 10 million.
It is a violation of the ethical and moral position that the government does not respect existing laws.
To get the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be needed in the year of need".
It is interesting to note that the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which has decided to protect it through an agreement between the Community and the Anec; it is the first such agreement in Italy aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the Periphery.
The measures provided for include tax advantages for cinema operators and public transport benefits: it is allowed to travel in the restricted areas of the centre and also to park more affordable parking fees.
"It is a happy initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also design new concepts.
Of course, we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to fix something against the superpower of the multiple cells, because ultimately the audience is more demanding today.
The defense of traditional cinemas has always been an important theme for me: the conclusion of the "Supercinism" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the outstanding point that led me to create the "New cinema paradise" even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years; if I go to the Rialto or Quirinale in the Via Nationale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side in order not to see the stuffed posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndranheta lead to the arrest of the Mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to adapt the decisions of the communities to the interests of the Mafia group Piromelli.
The charges against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torreone and his deputy representative Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for development in Mafia business are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the oldest mediator between the Clan and the public administration, as well as its grandsons: the lawyer who bears the same name as the boss of the Clan was already sentenced for development in criminal associations of the Mafia at the time to a fine of 10 million euros.
"Every kind of moral and legal standard is misleading," the lawyers wrote, "the two local authorities had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for advisory activities."
"So it was possible for the Mafia Group – so the judges – to enter the Council on an official way and to co-ordinate the policy of public administration."
The President of the Calabrian Regional Committee Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region "all other than one exception is to stand on links of local administrations and organised crime." "There are places in which the concentration of Mafia is greater than in others in which such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of 'Ndrangheta': heroes who get a white West."
Today's arrests followed by the last July, with which the police of Clan Piromelli were arrested.
Since the end of April, the Community Council of Gioia Tauro has been dissolved, but since 1991 – and at the same time due to significant links between organised crime and local administration – the local politicians of their fellowmen have been defeated.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then Mayor of Udc, was elected after the election from May 2006 to the head of the secondary law school.
He wrote scandal as the president ordered the resolution of the Community Council.
He was interested in finding out everything on political-strategic grounds in the Deputy Minister Marco Minniti, but the judges explained in connection with the arrest warrant this morning that the Piromalli-Clan had even expected to apply for an amendment to the A3 project.
From a hearing with regard to the investigations into the Dal Torrione case, the willingness has been shown to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known as a representative of the large group around the Piromelli – by which measures of public administration have been identical to the interests of this clan."
If the energy comes out of the waves, immediately the sizes run
It is a non-exhaustive source of money that covers over 70% of the planet's surface and only now seems to understand this about the world's major energy companies.
Wells, streams and seasons are the new renewable energy sources that all look at, and also look for jobs, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the sea's motions has been taken into account and examined for 70 years; these studies have not been intensified since the first earthquake.
When the oil price was introduced in 1980, the idea of marine energy was ignored, but now environmental organizations and the rising oil price are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the global energy demand could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This is similar to the double of the currently produced energy by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are still flows and seasons.
Giants at the attack.
The first company that is now based on marine energy is Enersis, who signed a contract for the creation of a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are now putting their energy gains at sea.
"Chevron is investigating these technologies," said the speaker of a well-known U.S. giant company in the Wall Street Journal, "and he wants to work with us."
This involves the acquisition of an authorisation from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project ahead of the Alaska coast.
This is not an underestimated sign, i.e. if you think that oil will continue to be promoted by the US in Alaska and President Bush recently put the plans for new drills in Gang.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which invest in the new industry, are also not known for the details, so observers speak of an increasing interest.
Still improved technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology still in use, which is not the latest since the latest doubts have not yet been made about environmental protection.
So far projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a smaller size and do not seem to cause serious environmental problems.
However, to produce energy to a large extent, technologies with a far greater impact on the environment need to be developed.
There are different options: Ocean Power uses a system of interconnected bojens.
The shell of the waves that move the bojen up and down is transformed into hydraulic pressure within the Swimminger over waves and cylinders.
This triggers a turbine that runs a generator again.
The electricity is sent to the coast through underwater channels.
To date, there are four planned facilities of this kind, which are only waiting for state approval. Some of the energy gained could also be used for military facilities.
Verdant Power is already producing energy for a shopping house and a parking lot using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the weather are moving the turbines that feed the generator through the resulting drive.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential customers are already waiting for the necessary authorisations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the weather.
A special interest is due, according to the Institute for Power Gain Research, to the potential of time.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the weather is more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of power.
In fact, newspaper energy is what the United States, such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal countries, has already invested $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million have been planned for 2009.
