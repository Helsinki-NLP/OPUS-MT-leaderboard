It's a study of the actions and interactions between the two points of the traffic flow, the interaction between the motorists and the vehicles.
Unfortunately, it's hard to work on traffic flow because driver behavior can't be predicted by hundreds of accuracy.
In any case, drivers show a pattern of behaviour in a stimulant image; thus, traffic flows can be accepted, and can be provided as a lot of mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, three parentheses have been identified: (1) flow, (2) humidity, and (3) speed.
These relationships will help to design, design and operate royal foundations.
