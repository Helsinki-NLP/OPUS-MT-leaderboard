If Nazar works at 5:30, he can use any means:
Green: Mariupoli - heart war, stop fighting - we will have a weak position
President Volodymir Zelenskiy believes that wars in eastern Ukraine and, in particular, in Mariupol, will determine the outcome of the war – and if the S.U.S.S. are there to win, the Russians can leave negotiations and re-equipped territories.
The direct language is, "Marioul is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It's fighting. We're fighting. We're strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have a weaker position.
They (the city’s defenders – right) are people who have pulled away a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupoli, the stronger our position will be on the east side of the state, in the (areas) of the EU, and if they are stronger, the closer we get to the table of talks and we will have the advantage of dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, we can't wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to return even to the cities we've purchased now.
They can go and do it.
At that time our situation in the talks will become weaker and may not even be of interest to the Russian side.
I'm sorry, we're seeing each other.
We believe in our outcome, our victory...."
Details: Green also said that it would be difficult to go to negotiations after the beatings of the Ukrainians, but "we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if they are in us."
A direct language: "People will take peace in any case because people want this war to end.
In our circumstances, the independence of Ukraine, but... every family has lost something, and I don't think they'll be satisfied with any peace under any circumstances.
But if we are not emotionally speaking, war should end in peace, or millions of victims will end.
And even where there are millions of victims, everything comes to an end to war.
Yes, we must fight — but for life.
You can't fight for the chicken when there's nothing left, there's no people."

According to Ukrainform, this is reported by the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine’s Chief Development Board in Facebook.
"Every farmer must know their names!
The U.S. Army officer's list of 64 separate motorcycle brigades, which are directly involved in the killing of military crimes against the people of Ukraine in M. Bucha, is received by the U.S.
In the U.S.R., it is noted that after the crimes committed against the peaceful population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought before the court and brought to justice.
A list of links can be viewed.
As reported by Ukrainform, Irpine, Bucha, Hostomel, and all the district of Kiev, they were released from Russian smugglers.
In the free cities and villages, mass killings have been committed by Russian civilians.
On April 1, the city head of Buchi Anatoly Fedoruk reported that 280 people were buried in the brothers ’ graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova said that on 3 April, 410 bodies of dead peacekeepers were exported from the Russian miners in the province of Kiev.
Russia’s 24 - year - old president, Vladimir, announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion in Ukraine.

Well, I've got money for two months rent, in the Olomoyota region doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my people are deeply shocked by the news of animal abuse from the civilian population in northern Kiev.
Photographs of people who had been shot and shot were disturbing the entire civilized world.
Ten people ask each other how this could happen in the 21st century?
I didn't know anything about it, and it's happening exactly what I did with my grief and I was waiting for...
I was out of the children and elderly parents from Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then my girlfriend and her kids, and then she came back to work.
Since 2014, I have been following up with the U.S.S.S.S.A. and I have no doubt that in the case of the occupation of Kiev my family will not be saved.
Because it was and I'm absolutely sure that the essence of the so-called Communist-Cdbist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, he just can't exist, he's built on terror.
In 1937 one of my ancestors was shot in the jails of Jitomir.
A few years ago, in the U.S.A., a copy was taken out of the fragmentary matter of propaganda: over a hundred pages of it, and the reason for the loss is very simple and even more frightening.
The defendant was illiterate, and he denied the charges.
The ethnic Pole, the Catholic, had five children, were free people, the poor "crazy" road, never walked in the streets.
The fact that they lived on the bushes and had several cows was enough to feed their young children to death.
The parents did not even know where to hide.
Grandma said that about a hundred people were taken out of the village and killed all but two people who agreed to give a witness.
There's a little bit more pressure on Sharia.
Our former speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics, and I'm not surprised if his family was a KGB informant.
The apple from the apple nears, as we know it, falls...
The scattered three that landed on the streets of the village were ethnic Russians.
In an analysis of the case, he was interested in various information resources.
There's a great (without a word) information resource in Russia like "The Death Bar" that really reminds us of the events of those years.
Thus, in today's Russian generation, NCPDists have found ways to punish and destroy almost everyone who has seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70 to 80 years ago.
People who found mass graves were victims of Stalin’s repression and had written the killer’s name publicly.
It's like they found files with child pornography on the computer, they put her in jail, and she's dead.
The KGB are now killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the past century.
So what suddenly do you marvel at their actions now?
It focuses on the most complex features of human nature.
Over a thousand years of tradition, slavery and imperialism were imposed on the 16th - 19th century.
And then, over what happened, they made an amazing genetic experiment by cutting intelligence over a few minutes of red terror.
Look at the 1992 movie "Chequist" in South France, that's all.
You saw my photo in the shop
Can you ask your wife what I can buy from the glass?
I'm sorry I don't have to ask anyone.
I still wanted to ask you maybe you know where the kids went because Gala can't mean them.

According to the issue, the proposal was submitted to the Ministry of Economics of Germany on Saturday.
The value of 100 dollars, including the school complex and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Also, it is proposed that the Goobits in the BTR Boxer option be set at 1.2 billion euros.
While the battle tanks need to be gathered relatively close to the enemy’s target, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire more than 30 miles [30 km] away.
According to the National Government Cars on the KMW proposal, the supply of self-contained goods will be covered by a circular scheme.
In the shortest term, the Bundesver will give Kiev 100 of its losers, and the proglars that have been created will then be filled with industry at the second stage.
The first new goobes may be placed 30 months after the contract was signed, i.e. the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed by 2027.
What about us in the first half of the day or the second half of the day together?

I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, honey, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I'm going to deal with it like we're together.
I'd say there's gonna be a lot of work after the war.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I can do a lot.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know what to do with my life.
I need to be careful about making a food license.
Please indicate that you will prepare your room tomorrow for 5 guests.
Five places I understand in the TV room?
To design and plant a wild animal?
Can we stop with you while Mrs. Margaret finds us a place to live?
Don't worry about it.
Not the new one they've used, but he's a job but he doesn't need...
Write the address to the Czech, see the map where it's from.
I don't know how much space there is, so I can't plan with furniture like this week to look at that room and then figure out what furniture I need.
I'm sorry it's been so long, it was a workday, it was hard to adapt
How long until it's enough?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, having this opportunity to fool you.

I'll just be a little bit later, somewhere about 8.
I don't want a misunderstanding with you.
Because I'm living to make it all right?
We didn't even talk about it with these excursions!
I understand how important it is to you!
And I'm talking about myself (for me it's just a thing I can't reach)!
How do you feel today?
Hello, I'm sorry, I just broke up, I slept badly.
I'm sorry I'm worried.
I was upset that yesterday Cole and I were having trouble translating the test.
I'll ask Gregory Deniseck or Jonathan) to help me with my mathematical concepts.
May I be able to be useful to them?
If that's possible, I want to draw mathematical terms for the output.
The geometry is difficult at all, but we have to work with Cole so that there is no error.
Thank you for your job test.
We're looking forward to this too.
And so she's very happy with any gift.
If you want to connect the Internet to your Czech phone number
Yesterday at the 402 bus stop, I met the Ukrainian Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes are full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stay on the islands.
Now we agreed to be friends.
And last night I thank God for this girl, because she's the first person in Ukraine who felt my heart involved.
File in Room No.29 is specially designed for the information and processing of requests for assistance
It turns out I've ordered a backup card.
No, I'm just a human.
So she wouldn't be afraid that nobody came.
I didn't go.
So you're leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago at the Memorial Center of the Ballocst of Babin Yar in Kiev, we celebrated 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yaru.
I had the honour to speak after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of "the common basis for international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their ways and lives in the territorial integrity, peace and security of Europe.
We must protect this foundation, which is also part of our responsibility in connection with our history."
"If the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us, Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The fight must last."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of peaceful inhabitants, starving its citizens to the famine and death from disease.
The Russian army executes massive shells of Ukrainians, even visually reminiscent of the explosions in Babin Yaru.
More than a month in Germany, it's seen in real-time news.
Yes, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, as well as a weapon that has not been possible for so long.
Germany is in danger of supplying the heavy weapon needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means more than just speaking against the circumstances.
This means fighting all possible means of mass killings, genocide, war crimes, and animals.
There is no easy way out of risk and sacrifice to overcome evil and stop wild animals happening in Ukraine.
One song for you tonight
We agree, talk about the trip, and write when we are going to be together
All the patients were just Lydia didn't get sick. They had a new type of ammonia.
Then I'll do it tomorrow.

Make sure the documents are too late.

Sergei Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a long-term perspective
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were opposed to NATO entry and only 18% of respondents were "for".
After the Cold Revolution, the runaway Victor Janukovic, the Crimean anecdotes and the start of the Donbasi war, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and the number of supporters, on the other hand, grew.
After the start of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists set a record level of support for Ukraine's entry into NATO among Ukrainian citizens over 75 per cent.
Despite Ukraine's support for NATO's entry into NATO and its assistance in the war conditions, there are now many criticisms on Alliance's account and members of the country – for the immediate supply of weapons, for refusing to close the sky, and for not wanting to "dry" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will have to give up its desire for membership in Alliance because of its position as a RF if it can stop the war and Ukraine will have reliable security guarantees, including military.
In the new episode, we are talking about how Ukraine's Alliance has helped with the Russian invasion, why NATO should be criticised, and why Alliance is critical of why our future NATO membership is closer than ever in history and why security guarantees that are discussed in talks with Russia can become another Budapest memorandum.
What do you think I'm doing here?
I'm a volunteer partner. I mean, my statement on the subject.
I gave it to her through this mobile supplement.
We don't have any visas, we need to go to the convention center and learn how to do this because they formed it in Poland, where the visas were not given, but they gave us a passport.
We'll write you a letter!
Dennis went in a good mood today.
He had a conversation with a young man from Ukraine whom he met yesterday at school to show him everything.
So I hope he's okay.
Because since I don't love, I don't have enough time
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks and anti-aircraft vehicles to Ukraine.
I'm going to leave my own kids there for three or four years and I'm going home because I can't leave anymore.
And with me at 6-7 in the morning
Yeah, it was heart disease.
I had a sincere feeling for this man, but he did not do very well and I left him.
Some time later he came back and apologized to me.
I rejected him.
Then, after some time, he called his heart surgery.
He just asked me to talk to him, and I hurt him.
I supported him psychologically for almost half a year.
By this time, we had many conversations.
At that time, I began to have problems at work.
His support also helped me at the time.
That's how they help each other.
And I thought maybe I really needed to look at him differently.
And he suggested that I get married and die two days later.
That is why God himself has decided our destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
And he's only talking about tea.
I mean, I've been able to find a place to live, and I'm really glad I'm going to have a place to live now and have a place to live with my child.
Did you ever have to mention me before?
) Because I helped look after the children in the family.

That time in the afternoon I bought two bags and Mom bought two
It's very nice of you, thank you.
You raised me up.
All right, let's do something else, so I don't sleep like this, I'm gonna get pregnant and I'm gonna dream of being bombed...
God is never late — his time and place.
I don't think he wants to bury me:)
I understand the price of unqualified work, and I understand that the job I had at home in Kiev, I can't have the money I've earned at home, I won't get it right now.
But just sit down and don't do anything I can't do, because then every bad thought in my head is going to have to do something physical.
At the airport, documents are drawn from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., and at another time you can just wait.
Wolodimir returned at 4:00 a.m.
So we took them to ourselves.
We met Vicka at the kitchen, put them in the bedroom.
I'll finish my job and go to the airport with them.
When he's with you, write it down and you'll find out what's next...
And I can't find a place anymore.
Please, sir, it's the invitation of the Ukrainian children to join the gymnasium.
Yeah, but I'm doing it hard.
Okay, write it to me when it's convenient.
I don't know until I know.
That's how we planned.
I'm sorry, I don't really have any missing calls in the middle.
The offer of work, the collection of baths and toilets, the smell of 3 windows, the removal of chicken.
It's about 3-4 hours.
I hope I'll just tell you that we're all right.
Can I call you?
Or can you write down your wife’s contact?
I'd like to ask what I can buy in my appetite.
I want to ask you for it.

He's coming to you.
Please tell me, and do you have any idea how to pick up a room for the month ahead, even if it's for a closer understanding of the day?
I don't remember this description )
The Russian army is threatening to make rocket attacks on Kiev: they say "They haven't done it before."
The Konaschenkova language is direct: "We are trying to make a difference and to deal with attacks by the Ukrainian army on RF objects.
If such incidents persist, the armed forces of the RF will launch attacks at the centre of decision-making, including in Kiev, where the Russian army had previously been detained."
The Russians had launched a rocket attack on Kiev since the first day of the total invasion of the RF in Ukraine.
On February 25, the rest of the Russian rockets, which broke the Ukrainian PPO system, fell into a multi-square building on the capital Poznika.
The 26th - February Russian rocket took place on a large scale in the hope of Valeria Lobanov.
On March 1, the Russians set up a TV on Dorogožic Square near Babin Yaru, resulting in the death of 5 survivors.
On March 2nd, the WFP systems were hit by Russian rockets flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defence.
On March 14, the explosion of the occupied rocket destroyed the house and troleibus on the Kurenwica in Kiev
On March 18, the Russian rocket hit a living mass on the vineyard where one person died, and 19 others were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets destroyed the modern Retroville TRC in Vinogradari, resulting in at least 4 deaths.
Mr. Kieva Vitalai Cličko, where he declared on April 13, that the capitals who had fled the city were to return as soon as they could.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still defeat the rocket attacks on Kiev, and in addition to many mines and unsuspecting warships around the centuries.
The Ministry of Defence's main development management of Ukraine's Ministry of Defence announced on April 12 that the Russians are planning to take the first low-trags in the area of the RF to accuse the Ukrainians and to correct the violence of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, Belgrade, Russia’s oil base exploded, as if it were the result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local government of Belgrade declared that near the city it was as if it had fallen into "the Ukrainian army".
It is evident that Elite and Washington and Berlin are on the cold road from the very idea that the Natsug destroyers will destroy Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelenski speaks not only with them but with their voters and societies as a whole.
In his talks in parliaments and in front of thousands of people in Europe’s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that none of his predecessors have ever done before.
Green doesn’t convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, and he does so for European peoples who choose them.
And these talks, this excited flood of strength, excitement, and time of disappointment, gradually reach their goal.
By the same time, Byden is categorically opposed to closing the sky, 70 percent of its fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is opposed to speeding up Ukraine's entry, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so they don't want us to be treated as witches.
The costs that you will collect are better to give to people who are more in need.

There's hope... it's not a long time.

Many of our leaders didn't pay for our robots.

You don't know what they'll be worth tomorrow or not.

These were small businesses that covered the Volcano walls in their premises and shops.
They're tractors that actually go into the field under guns because it's time to go.
These are bus drivers who are now willing to travel to the Himalayas in the area where they are now occupied to get help and get people out of there.
These heroic leaders, who fearlessly go to the field of combat, calm down and help refugees in the trucks, and at peaceful stations help the volunteers to get involved in the humanitarian car.
They were car owners who stood on the road to Life on the first day of the war and patiently served the frightened and frustrated people.
They are consuls who carry garbage under the fire, repair the waterways and transmitters lines to provide the people with the necessary supplies.
They are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining, but they still volunteer at the front.
We're in Ukraine, leaving a scar when there's little leaves)

Very delicious apples, what kind?
The head of President Andrey Jermak's office told us that Russia is starting a "female operation" about the weapon that the allies are sending us.
The German language is direct: "They understand that they are losing the war, see their distance and want to "kill" the arms supply by any means.
For example, one of the last faeces is the destruction of the Slovak C-300 CR.
This information has already been made available to Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What's next? We know Russian script.
They can launch the faeces that the Ukrainian soldiers look like a weapon from the allies, and it's massively passed on to the Russian army.
I'd like to warn you right away.
Because weaponry in the hands of the U.S. Army only sends an enemy into that world.

We picked up the whole room and moved into the other room.
International co-operation continues to express shock and frustration after the evidence shows that Russian forces have committed atrocities against the peaceful population in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these messages as “provocation”.
"The report on the deaths, rapes and serious injuries suffered by Russian troops of peaceful Ukrainian inhabitants is worth a trial," New Zealand Prime Minister Jasind Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
"Russia should answer to the world for what they have done," she added, stating that her government will discuss additional steps to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kisid called the incident "in violation of international law".
Statements were made after the appearance of reports of hundreds of peaceful residents being shot and thrown into brothers ’ barracks or left on the streets in the capital city of Kiev, Buchi, by Russian soldiers who left the area after a few weeks of occupation.
Photographs depicting the bodies of missing civilians with their hands were shocked by many and led to calls for the enforcement of sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in a radio interview on 4 April that there are signs that the Russian army has committed "war crimes" in Buchi.
"What happened in Buchi requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed towards Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the Russian army could take as far as they did "genocide" in Buchi.
"We will do everything we can to keep those who have committed these war crimes from being free of charge," said Sanchez in Madrid.
On April 3rd, on public television, the Russian MCS spokesman Maria Zacharov dismissed the charge as a "provocation".
Without evidence, she said that the United States and NATO had "ordered" the image to discredit Russia.
"In this case, I think that the fact that these statements were made in the first minute after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubt about who "had written this story," said Zechariah.
Earlier, Russia’s Minobaroni also claimed without evidence that Buchi’s image was “one more permanent Chinese regime ” and that all Russian troops had left the city until March 30th.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on 4 April to discuss what it called "the provocation of the Ukrainian radicals" in Buchi.
On April 4, the following Russian committee issued a statement announcing the “research” charge in Ukraine’s extension of “indiscriminately false information” about the actions of Russian troops in Buchi.
Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskiy spoke on 3 April, accusing the Russian army of the genocide in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they had to come to Buchi to see what they had done.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are carried out," Zelenski said in a video interview, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there's a common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for the shooting in the basement," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for the military activities in Ukraine.
"When we find people with ties behind their hands and heads, I don't understand," he said about the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Buchi, the city about 35 kilometers north of Kiev.
On April 2nd, the Ukrainian Radio Freedom correspondent saw the streets of a small town of civilians.
In just one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
At least 21 people from different parts of Buchi have seen the bodies of AP journalists.
The bodies of one group of nine people — all in civilianity — were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to local residents, used Russian forces as a base.
It seems that the victims were killed from a nearby distance.
In general, the Ukrainian government stated that at least 410 peaceful inhabitants were found in the area of Kiev, which had been controlled by Russian troops last week.
Thanks, everything is, we bought everything on the list.
"They said, "There's no key." How did the occupationrs export Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus?
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: kidnappings, rapes, killings, beatings.
There is another point in this account that is now much less information — the export of local people to the enemy territory.
About mid-March, Russian occupationrs "evicate" Ukrainians from the then occupied settlements in their territory and the territory of Belarus, which President Lukaschenko actually gave himself under the Russian military command.
The "foreign Truth" sought out foreigners and their families to ask how the "evacuation" is happening and whether there are ways to return after it to Ukraine.
Hero of this text was committed to voluntary and forced evacuation across Ukraine under psychological pressure and away from the exit.
Luckily, they live and maintain family ties.
However, in view of the claim made by the Ukrainian government, many citizens were deported to Russia and Belarus under severe pressure.
So in Melitopol, the Russians stole the staff of the second semi-trailer house, expelled children without their parents, including 12-year-old Miroslav, the daughter of a Ukrainian lost champion from the Flood of Joseph Zezepine.
The family of Oleksandra, Marini and their 10-year-old daughter, Vali, moved to Hostomela a few months before the war.
Alexander himself got a job at Antonov Airport, located some five miles [2.5 km] from the village.
The family lived in the military city, although it was civil.
As the real plastics, Dennis and Marina have long gathered anxious whiskeys, but they haven't arrived in the morning of February 24th.
They had no car, and the city buses had never taken anyone.
About 12 o'clock on February 24th, they saw helicopters with Latin letter V, followed by the first flight.
One of them turned into a neighboring house.
The family then landed in the basement and stayed there for three weeks until March 17 until the Russian army took them to Belarus.
About 40 people were buried in their basements.
Not everyone decided.
"On the 6th night of the 24th February, people who spoke Russian and not Ukrainian came up.
They say, "Who is there?" They say, "Come out!"
They were looking for me, asking who was in the basement if there was a gun.
All the men were asked if they had served in the army.
They said to women, "We've come to protect you from the command of Ramzan Kadrov."
It was the Czech OMON, not even the military, young boys 25-35 years of age.
They said, "We helped the Ukrainians in the war, Shako Billy (commanded by the United Nations Nationalist Movement "Wiking", which fought alongside the Chechens in the first Russian-Chain War -- UP), now we're here to help you."
On the third day, they asked what was not enough for us.
We're saying the water was a big problem with her.
They broke the store, took the goods from under the heading "All the same Russians" and brought us six bottles.
There's still a video on the Internet where children thank Kadir for food.
So that's what they did after they took the store and they brought the cubes and they said, "We understand it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramsana Ahmatovic."
They did not want to talk to anyone, but they did have a good reputation.
Our child there says, "You have seven days to give us our phones," they laughed.
Still, they kept separate from the Russians.
They said, as good as they came, because they didn't want to go to war, and the Ukrainians support it, and they say, "The road is a disaster, and also the Kaderovs, but we can't do anything because there are our families."
And basically they didn't fight, but they used to steal magazines, they were starving.
The whores went in, one tied to one leg of the georgian striker, and the other to their white shot and called it "a soldier".
They came to Ukraine without any preparation.
I don't know how their divorce worked... when they were killed in Buchi, so they didn't even take the murdered, they asked us, "What do you have?"
Moreover, we were faced with the bans — the waiters did not know each other, and the first day they asked for a password to identify themselves or a stranger.
They were with us until March 13th, after the Russian NGO came, and behind them was the Ossetian.
They set up 30-40 units between houses, and we've always fallen into it from the Bircators.
But these came and told us that the U.S.S.S.A. is no longer there, but there's "Azov", and, in their words, "Azov" is about 100 thousand in Ukraine.
The birth of "Kiev seems already" has been asking since early March.
One day a Russian officer, or a Desant, or a representative of the FBI, came to us and said that it would be evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio -- there was about Buchu, Gotomel, and we thought maybe we might have a green corridor.
From the very beginning, we've handed out our lists to the waiters, and they've promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're being exported to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We're saying we don't want either there or there.
What they said was, "Please take care of your children's psychotics!"
How it worked: they took us to the basement and started shooting at us from the bottom of the house -- either "Citys" or "Ministers."
And then it flew back... nearby houses were just burned, some of them were burned.
In our house there was a direct connection to the third floor.
Later they agreed to take us out to Belarus, promising to transfer us to the concordants and the Red Cross.
The party didn't go, saying it's for the traitors of the parents, he said, "You're fired there, you're sold to bodies."
We were taken through Cornobil, on both sides of the road were burned, broken techniques, although the Belarusians told us that the Russians would soon export them.
There are so many Captonians, buried techniques and soldiers.
At the Belarusian crossing point, we've gone through improvised control, many of whom were without documents because they were burned.
We were placed in Red Cross houses, given tea.
And here we hear shots!
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, these planes fly, they turn around on the corner."
But we from aviation, we have education, we understand it.
We were then loaded on the bus and taken to the Chonky's station near Gomel.
His manager, Wenger Vassil Stephanovic, came and said, "Well, I'm a hero, I'm from Montenegro.
But I understand that Putin and Lukaschen will not stop until you get these eggs.
The poor people are suffering!
We've got Lukaschenko so good!
As he will say, so will it."
They proposed an interview with the Belarusian journalist, but no one wanted.
The Sanatorium administration told us, "You're already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN (at least they called themselves so) were spreading information that men in Poland were unable to travel.
Many believed in it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents — the daughter had no passport.
We had to get it on Monday, and on Thursday the war started.
At the country council, we had nothing to do with anything, and in Minsk, on the coast, we were told that no one in the bus would take us without passports.
I'll tell you here that the Belarusian volunteers helped us a lot.
We were also settled in Minsk, and the relief work was carried out.
They didn't have the strength in the sanatorium.
Our second group of migrants said that you can spend the maximum week in the south here because Belarus is not Europe, there is no payment here.
We found an internal carrier who had agreed to export us to Warsaw.
On our way to Mozambique (about 30 miles [50 km] from the Ukrainian border — the U.S.), we saw the launch of a ballistic missile in Ukraine: the rocket starts to fly, the world is beautiful, and then the gas is gas.
People sitting on a bus in Mozir told us that the Russians were constantly shooting at Poles.
But I can say that the balloons don't want to fight.
The generals are released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something if she was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, does not believe at all.
They will say: "You are mad, we are a people of peace."
They do not realize that their Poles are used to shoot Ukraine.
In Poland there were friends who took us to Estonia.
Now we're going through the registration, we're going to decide what we're going to do next.
In Estonia the country's pros are now, of course, as much as the Estonians."
Marina lived in the area of a military town in Gotomela with her brother's family, his wife and two children, 18 and 22.
On the morning of February 24, she phoned the tribals and asked them to collect the most necessary items and documents.
At night they went to sleep in the basement of a neighbor’s house.
Marina herself was unable to return home, and in principle she could not, she no longer owns the house.
No one knew anything about evacuation.
You can't go to the center on Monday?

On April 1, the city’s capital, Buchi Anatoly Fedoruk, announced the glad tidings that on March 31, the Ukrainian army released the city from Russian hostages.
The next day the occupationrs were expelled from all parts of the Kiev area.
However, the joy that would have been felt at this time by the Ukrainians was compounded by fear and hatred, since at the same time it became known that at least 280 peaceful inhabitants were scattered in one Buchi.
They were just killed on the streets, some tied their hands together and shot in the street, some of them killed -- minors.
The executions and tortures took place in Motizin Olgo Suchenko, her husband, Igora, and his son, Oleksandra, who were robbed on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexandra were in the brothers ’ bedroom, Igorya, in the canal.
Along the way, 20 miles [20 km] from Kiev, several women who had been burned alive in the cave appeared.
The Russians were trying to burn them.
And if I go home, no one's gonna be home.

President Volodymir Zelenskiy said that some types of weaponry that Western partners have come too late.
That's what he said in an interview with Associated Press, published by the President's Office, says "European Truth."
"All equipment they already send, for some types of equipment it's done late.
So when we, for example, talk about Mariopol when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries I see 100 percent support, that's right.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," said Green.
The question is, this weapon has been given enough by Ukraine to make a difference in the war, the president said, "Not yet, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a NATO member, this war would not have been, or it would have looked different.
"It'd be a different thing, we'd have close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I'm sure war wouldn't be the same," he added.
We remember, the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, including brontechnics and protocorable weapons.

Men also have a lot of news.
He was very much human, but he liked me because I had my point of view of life I met him and then left him.
He was very busy, and after a while he phoned and told me that he had had an operation on his heart.
He just asked me to talk to him and support him, and it hurt me.
He was very much human and thought I could play his game and I might need his money.
And then he made me a proposal.
"The car was standing in my yard, like a crocodile, and dropped the walls.

I understand I can't sit with you. I need to work.
I understand. Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 and we need a national television.

"We've been hiding from all over the world information about war for a whole month.
As long as it works.
However, in Plamka (the U.S.A.) on the back and back of the lungs, rapid movements can be caused by stress, mood changes, and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are gone, and here's the stress I don't care about, unfortunately.

Because Olga hears evil and spends most of her time in her room, her unconscious month lived in her apartment with her "incognito".
On April 1, 93, Oksana Polova took the gun first in her life.
"33 days I lived with her in the room as a party.
She was also hidden from the war, and what I was doing was officially coming as usual for several hours.
But when her husband spoke, I gave her the receiver, she listened for four hours, then she sang for two hours."
The receiver was always near the bed.
Most of the time, the universe is in its own room.
I felt bad. It made me feel like I didn’t notice her.
If I heard her "fucking" sound, I'd hide in my room.
First, she hid from her host and television.
And then she called everybody she's been talking to, and it's 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about what was right, not just about war.
I'm asking my friend, she was there from the beginning and to the end

The British who defended Mariopol in the Soviet Union says he's ready to go to Poland to Russia
The British military commander of the coast of Ukraine’s Armed Forces, who participated in the defense of Mariupola, told his friends and family that they would form a weapon and surrender it to the Russian occupation.
Source: twitter page Eiden Eislyn, a British who served in the 2018 SSU camps, WVS with reference to family members and friends of Eislyn, Atlas News with reference to Eislyn's friend who talked to him
I mean, we got a message from him: "For the past 48 days, we've tried everything we can to protect Mariopol, but we have no choice but to pay taxes to the Russian army.
We had no food and war supplies.
Thank you all. I hope the war will end soon."
Details: Eislyn served in the 36th single coast of the U.S. Navy, which participated in the defense operation of Mariupol.
The VVS journalists contacted the mother of military officer Ann Wood, and she confirmed that her son had told her on the phone that they were planning to become a cop.
Another military officer, Brian Phillips, also confirmed to journalists that during his last phone call, Eislin spoke about their plans for their separation from capitalism.
In his words, warfare and food shortages were to end in strife.
Journalists of Atlas News contacted his friend who said that the apartheid of Eislin was intended to appear in the field of Russian apartheid so as not to reach without a weapon and a bullet at the hands of what's called "coordinators."
Sociologists also broadcast audio recordings of telephone conversations, such as Eislyn’s talk to a well - known American friend who plans to travel to Ukraine.
In his talk, Eislin said that they were trying to get out of town in civil clothing but could not.
The former British told him that Instagram was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Eislin was a social worker in New York-on-Trent City in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he joined in the fight against terrorists called the Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018 he officially entered the U.S. Army and signed an oath.
Eiseline's friends and neighbors called Johnny, and he's better known in the solar system as Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I'd like to know whether we're together or not.

My family's fine. I've got my mom, my three brothers and my husband.
One brother in the war in Mariupoli, the other in Poseiga, and a man from Kiev today were transferred to Harkow.
They call every day to say that everything's fine, and that's where people know it, they don't always tell the truth.
She wanted to come to you, but she wanted to handle some things.
I'll ask the man tomorrow if he'll be there tomorrow.
When you come home, please write to me, please, I'd need to talk to Daniel.
Attackers for their losses in the fight were playing full.
They shot the teacher Dmitra Paulic, whose name was unknown to his family, young Boris Oleksiank.
Their bodies were thrown into “the graveyard of the one lying down on the ground. ”
“ There was a dead silence in the city, ” he recalls.
Suddenly, one of the residents fled from the house to the home.
In the streets, bodies were always seen by the mobs
And I, maybe I'll go after you, and you need me.
3. What your own activity/activity would help you or your friends better adapt to life in Chechnya?
But you won't come here because there's a railway construction and a closed road.
Go to the bridge where the reconstruction is going, tell me that they're gone and I'm coming to you.

I want to be able to thank all those who helped us because it was the last hope, the truth.
I'm not afraid of work, just as I was living in the village, so I can and I like to work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
You're very interested in tradition. We're going to Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council endorsed Bill 7176, entitled "To monitor the potential threats to national economic security in Ukraine".
Surprisingly, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the field of economics has emerged... where the members of the board of directors and bankers meet.
Initiators of the project believe that making a decision by the maintenance company in the state of Kiev can somehow solve the problems of Ukraine’s national security.
We know about a large number of new dangers for the company, but until we know about any company that has had to be physically involved in the meeting of the supervisory board for the location.
The potential threat of such a law has been understood to be a great basis for "to bear" all the acquisitions in the difficult reform of the enterprise after the Cold Revolution, including independent supervisory advice and then to set up manual management.
The one that was until 2015.
Why is oversight counsel for companies, and who should be involved in it?
More than that, if under Patriotic Gas "flights" one of the harmful laws, others can fly tomorrow, for example, through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
There is much you can write about the war.
In fact, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and Bill 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this rule was introduced to a comparative table of draft law 5397.
In general, the desire to avoid supervision in one way or another has long been a driving force among some of the peoples of the world.
Not because of criticism such as this, but because of the possible consequences of the bill, we will understand the arguments that were explained as to the need for it to be accepted.
And then we're going to give our suggestions on how to deal with the issue of the management of entertainment while the war is over.
First Deputy Minister of Economics Dennis Cudin explained the need for such a innovation by risking loss of the Internet and other means of communication that would make it impossible for remote work of supervisory advice.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, as far as the company's work is concerned.
We agree that this is a risk, but can it prevent it from moving members of the monitoring team to Ukraine?
Imagine a situation that is quite cynical when independent members of the Governing Body (which make up the majority of the overall population) put their personal security ahead of the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, they can be released under the bill.
And, more importantly, this will lead to the loss of the quorum necessary for the monitoring of any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to appoint new independent members of the supervisory board quickly because the law foresees the need for a competition committee which lasts for 3-4 months.
Thus, the decision proposed by Bill 7176 will soon be unable to prevent the loss of the supervisory board from making decisions, and it will result in much more than that!
People's MP, the author of Dmitro Nataluha's bill provides other arguments for his support.
In particular, he notes: "Many companies, especially the defence-industrial complex (OPC), now need relocations" and therefore "it's hard to imagine that a person can discuss addresses and other sensitive information, for example, on Friday by Zoom."
At first, there are almost no OPCs in Ukraine that have oversight.
The supervisory board is wrong in the Crowds, which basically manages almost all of the PPC's holdings.
But even in the Crowds, according to the law, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all its members are carrying out their duties on a non-tax basis.
All the government in the "Croans" belongs to the Director-General, who will decide on the need to relocate the OPC company or other company that is part of the concert.
Moreover, this argument does not support criticism yet, and Bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation governing the activities of the OPCS.
Mr. Dmitro also points out on his Facebook page the arguments that can be attributed to the "Emotional" category.
Such arguments are usually nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of holding companies and holding banks, but let's try to figure out some of them: "reverent foreign experts in the first word "war", still remain in Ukraine in 2021, but in this case they remain members of state-owned companies with a full salary of several hundred thousand pounds, while Ukraine is actually suffering from war".
First of all, it's manipulation - most of these surveillance members never lived in Ukraine and only regularly came here.
So to say that they're "remaining Ukraine," mildly saying, wrong.
Secondly, as a result of the pandemic of Coronavirus, both foreign and Ukrainian members of the supervisory board have long been involved in the practice of online meetings.
This tool has long been popular in world practice, which has resulted in a wide variety of areas: business, education, medicine, and so on.
It should also be remembered that membership in the supervisory board is not a full-time job.
Usually, these people have other jobs, and now electronic means help them with this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims only for foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitro not express the same claim to members of the supervisory board who are Ukrainians?
Because they're not where they're from.
In fact, this is not the first populist attempt to get immigrants out of control, and war is just a new opportunity.
Hi, I'm in Ukraine, I'm looking for possible options for temporary family shelter, with me two children.

In the Brovars, the Highlands, and the Buchanan regions of the Kiev area, which were released from occupations, they are conducting a two - hour intensive commandal period.
Paul’s direct words: “In the breeding grounds of the Brovar, the Highlands and the Buchanan regions, which were under Russian occupation and were released by the national defence forces, the command clock was sent!
In the territory of these cities and the border forces will take place from 21:00 2 April to 06:00 5 April."
Details: According to the head of the VolvaA, at this time it is categorically prohibited from staying on the streets of residential sites and other public places, transport and roads.
The residents can just walk out of the street during the alarm signal to get into hiding.
Such restrictions are designed to remove the effects of Russian aggression — to clean up and change the territory.
Omelanuk invited those who had left these areas to stay until they returned home.
In the rest of the province of Kyivtina, the time of command will be from 21:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.

After the full-scale RF aggression against Ukraine, the Western countries took a very serious view of the potential humiliation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complex and globalized.

The Lukaschenka regime imposed three 27 - and 28 - year - old blouses, which were responsible for the destruction of two religious leaders under the Osipovica, which provides the movement of railways.
Source: "Radio Freeboda", the Centre for the Protection of Human Rights "Wasna", the Chief of the Criminal Police of IMS Gennadi Kazakewich, quoted by the Belgian intelligence agency "BelTA"
In IMS Belarus, it was reported that on the night of March 30 for the strong support of the "SOBR" specialists were arrested by three residents of Bobrujska, one injured.
According to The Light, when the men were arrested, they were actively opposed and tried to escape.
The security forces used the weapon.
One of the inmates was injured and is in a medical hospital.
Others were provided with medical assistance at the site.
IWS Crime Police Chief Bilorsi Hennadi Kazakevic said "the acts of terrorism on the RB would be severely halted" by the use of weapons.
On 6 April, it became known that on 30 March, the police arrested another Belarusian railway employee, Baranovic's partner "BJD" and the thematic resource manager "BJD" in "VContacts and "Odnoclasses" Valentin Samasuka.
Where he is now living and in what state he is unknown, he reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 passengers were arrested by the rest of Belarus.
We remember: the formation of BYPOL, announced by Lukaschenka extremistic mode, continues to call on Belarus to make variations in rail transport and Belarus infrastructures within the "Help" plan.
Belarus's "reik partners" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
It is well known that because of Belarus, the RF is transforming into a living force and technology in Ukraine.

The United States bans investment in the RF and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughter
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, has introduced new sanctions against the daughter of RF Putin, the largest banks of RF Alpha Bank and Sberbank, as well as prohibiting all new investments in Russia.
This is what is happening on the White House website.
Sberbank is Russia's largest financial institution, which is owned by the government, while Alpha Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions freeze any of their assets related to the U.S. financial system and prevent US citizens from taking business with them.
In addition, the States have introduced a full ban on new investments in the IMF.
To this end, U.S. President Joe Byden will sign a new order that includes a ban on new investment in Russia by citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on the approved over 600 transnational companies that have decided to leave Russia.
The private sector's output includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retail dealers, financial institutions and other service providers such as legal and advisory firms," says the White House.
A third step of new sanctions from the United States has resulted in restrictions on large Russian state enterprises in the critical area.
This will prevent US citizens from carrying out operations with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
The detailed list of Minfin will be scheduled for the next day at 4:00.
And the last part of the package is the complete blockage of the assets of Putin's adult children, his wife and daughter, Minister of Order of Lavrov, as well as the members of the Security Council of Russia, including the president and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvejev and Prime Minister Michael Mousstin.
Sanctions remove them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

We lived in a beautiful world, and we did not even think we would have to run because there was no strength in hiding in the grave.
I was lucky and found a job in Prague, Czechia.
So we hope that someone will take us away for the first time) We can even pay a room or a room, but if we do, it will be showered.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We don't have harmful habits.
We will be grateful for such help at such a time that it is not easy for us.
After lunch I had one English lesson and then went to work in a child room.
There I explained to Margareta how to complete all the papers.
I hope she understands everything and does everything well.
I also met Mrs. Linen and talked to her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She made a statement from the base.
It's free swimming.
You can call school, Kira doesn't call, she doesn't answer, I don't know if she got to school.
They isolate the Russian office: they stop investments and stop supplying.
But we didn't understand.
There was no military service in our home.
Our home is next to a military unit and a gas station.
He was just helping me because I wouldn't do it myself.
It's delicious, I don't ask for a drink and I'm giving you good advice.
I'll give you some advice.
I'm a little hard, but I understand I have to go through this step.
I'll see you on Thursday and I'll tell you everything.
It's all right.
how often you pick up
I'll take it every week.
I'm sorry I don't have any programs, but I'm trying to figure it out.
I dreamed of being a teacher
My girls can't go anywhere right now, so I didn't write the owner of the house.
She wanted to ask you that if you'd hear about living information, you'd let me know.
I would be happy to live with a good girl.
If you can know that, let me know.
On my side, I'm not going to take it.
Thank you very much.
I didn't write you another person named Natalie 54 years old. Please write the exact address and how much the fees cost.
I think it's better for you to make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
Besides I haven't changed, it's one of my births:)
Good morning, Mr. Reirard, I'm sorry I didn't see you.
We're going to the Medical Committee now.
That's why Anna needs to work this time another day.
What day would it be better for her to come earlier? (maybe the day she works a little more?)
I'll hear you tomorrow, I'm working wrong on the Internet.
You're happy you're gonna do it.
Thanks for finding something, but there was nothing from the technique...
Both starters, except objects we don't know anything
There's nothing going on.
May I see you on Monday 25.04?
You can take the kids with you, the game here is enough :)
I thought about my father.
I'm sure I'm most popular or very popular, but I'm thinking about this money.
We'll do it somehow.
But as soon as it gets paid, please don't have any credit.
Write me straight, and I'll help you.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know.
You need to take that stuff with you?
Today's not my day.
Something's coming from you. I can't see that.
I'm also very sad.
I remind you of the factor later
Do you have only a father who speaks and understands Russian?
On what day does a fellow worker want to build a house and how many windows he has?
I'm ashamed to get you out of your business.
Good evening, I can't share it with you.
I like to respect Joe Dispence, he's doing research on the impact of external factors and the formation of new neurons.
Natalya Nagorna, a TV journalist "1+1", watched her on the morning of the 12th April video broadcast to her by the army's 36th coast of the sea from Mariupola.
It says that they have no weaponry to take part in wars and the suffering of the wounded.
They said, "The account's going in an hour."
Prior to this, on April 11, 36, a separate bridge of the seaway, which participated in the defense of Mariupola, published a call to Russian-speaking Ukrainians.
It was said that on April 11, it could be the last fight for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command was not linked to the fighters for two weeks.
Sozemmers reported that they published a statement in Russian.
The Chief Commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valerie Prison, has assured us that there is a link between the command and the defence forces in Mariupoli and that the details of the defence operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block the Ukrainian fighters in the area of the Austall plant in Mariupoli and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, the Russian occupationrs threw the garbage into Mariupol’s home.
According to the leader "Azova" by Andrey White, the RF has used a chemical weapon at the Azoustall plant, which holds the Azov field fighters.
Thank you, I'll fit under you.
The situation and itself until we stay here.
2 hours rides )) hugs, mom by shop and back)!
That doesn't matter.
She forgot what she was doing here.
The Czech drone squadrons have been flying over Ukraine since today.
Nearly 50 professional copters will be used for detection, and one of them will be for immediate destruction of the enemy.
Two Zakarpats and two Czech brothers "flying" sent to Ukraine yesterday through the Mukačev municipality of Volodymir Labuttenka's MP.
Today, their best friends are with the village council director and coordinator at https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/wasil Turmoon. They have received special divisions of Ukrainian troops in various cities where they are now carrying out military operations.
In order to make the most effective and safe use of computers, the place where they are moving is now left in the darkness.
Four friends who help the Chinese army from Chechnya do not plan on stopping, say that the next few days to Ukraine will send more of the interesting gifts, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupation and preserve the lives of the Ukrainian heroes.
I didn't miss it, it was all right.
I'm worried we're not gonna make it.
Soon to return to Ukraine, continue to work
All right, if it's all right, I'll agree.
I'm trying myself, but if there's any problems I'll write you down if I can?
A Key to Understanding One Another
We were in the old lady’s village in the village of Iva, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no one to live
Maybe she'll be betrayed and she'll get up.
I've been rehabilitated today.
And I think I'm still on the street today.
I've been drinking drugs and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm sorry, too, but I'd better meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, take off the music you like.
I'm interested in the music you have.
Mom and Dad Should Listen
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's car.
Today there was colder and rain, and tomorrow it's gonna be hot.
But no damage to damaged buildings, damage to people who suffer from occupation
In Herson, the occupations were introduced to the remembrance of "the glory of Ukraine" in Herson on the streets of the Prekopsky.
Details: It is noted that the European Union's promotions have been seen unknown, have spent hundreds of photographs of the sky and have been lost in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupationrs were looking at the portraits of the hundreds of heavenly heroes and lost participants in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
You've got a promotion.
Good morning, thank the kids for the cake, we don't usually have that kind of thing, so we didn't know if the kids were just chocolate and cheese, maybe something else to give.
There's someone in the Czech Republic who can talk if that's what.
Because I live a guy in the garage until twelve people are here, and then they're going to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
He was already in the woods today.
Even today he's been sleeping there.
That is why we are making great progress.
I'm obliged to bring the guards together!
Today I don't have the power to do them.
Since I'm away from the day and the time that there's work to pick up the room after the guests, I can tell you about the month's flower because I already have an approximate schedule for renting the room.
On May, I can say about it at the end of April or at the beginning of May.
I'm just wondering if you have anything to say about it.
Hello, I'm sorry she didn't have a long time to go to dinner and get some sleep.
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
or we'll meet you after your arrival.)
He's been humble, he's been learning a lot lately, and he realized that he needed it very much in his life.
( Hello) It's been a very good time.
I was a little shocked that I was working with people at such a high position.
Today, there is a small lesson from a woman who is the director of an economic division in the country.
She was very pleased with my work.
It's just that I've been acting well in my glasses.
On Monday, I'm going to have a job confirmation as well as a cash payout.
I've been on my way since Friday
I don't do anything just a lot of them and I sleep. (and I drink a lot of water )
If I go to the doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you if I can.
I have to do another analysis.
And then you won't have to walk again.
It's a really bad thing to do with an empty mirror, it's a bad smile.
That's enough there.
Can you send me the correct e-mail address?
I want to send you an invitation to a course in the Czech language you wrote about.
And do children grow up there or do they have to bring them together?
And now you can ask one question at a time.
When Help Is Needed to Write
If I'm not wrong, you're celebrating Christmas today, right?
At first, we didn’t want you to collect money so people didn’t think we were expecting it!
But I didn't have two points for online completion:
I'll be on my way to rest.
That's a great idea. I'm going to see the video.
The Karazin University calls on workers and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in brokers and social networks, hearings and tablets.
Focus only on official information.
That's how you can count on me, thank you!
my other brother who stayed in the country also helped the army
I've got some work to do for the portfolio.
After the holiday, they have to use the Internet.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How I miss the day I wasn't at work is a break
State statement: Russia is preparing a provocation in Pridnistrava to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army can provoke provocation in the Pridnistrov region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "in aggression against a neighboring state".
In essence: "The Russian Federation's armed forces are not excluded from carrying out provocations in the territory of the Prednistrav region of the Republic of Moldova with a view to accusing Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring state."
Details: The opponent continues to create the next army grouping for action on the Slavian route.
In the near future, it is likely that the occupationrs will try to restore progress.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and dispatch personal equipment, equipment, and technology to participate in military operations in Ukraine.
The preparation of weapons and military technology is being carried out at the point of the permanent dislocation of the 60th single-armed Brigade (Monastria) of the 5th General Army of the Eastern Military Area.
It is likely that the designated weapon will be transferred to the immediate occupied territory of the Danube.
To restore the loss of the private composition of the Battalion Tactical Group from the 36th single motorcycle brigade (Borosia, Zabakal County) 29 military forces of the Eastern army are being mobilized by military personnel from the designated brigade.
An enemy’s particular problem is the integration of the driver’s and driver’s equipment.
The removal of the selected personal composition from the point of permanent displacement is scheduled for the second half of this year.
It is likely that the opposition will continue its attacks on the transport infrastructure in the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy or eradicate them.
Certain divisions of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Croatian-Ballorian border in the Brest and Gomel districts.
In the Slovene direction, separate from the composition of the 6th General Army and the coastal northern fleet, partial blockades of Harkova continue to take place in each of the towns.
In the Isimian direction, an air exploration of the area is carried out to identify the position of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
That's why the opponent's using the "Orlan-10" BPLA.
The forces of two battalion tactical groups of enemies tried to make progress toward the residential points of Dawgenjka and Dmitrovka, which were not successful and reached an earlier position.
In the Southern Hemisphere, the main effort continues to focus on the capture under the control of Popasna, Rubian, Nizhni and Novobahmutka, as well as the establishment of full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to maneuver the region into the gold field, but he failed.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aircraft, occupationrs continue to operate in the outlying areas of the Austalia and the seaport.
The strengths of individual enemy divisions have led to the artillery shootings of the position of the Ukrainian troops in the areas of the breeding sites of High Copilla, Trudobowska and Maryansk.
In the area of the Danube and Lugan, Ukraine's defenders in the past suffered four enemy attacks, five tanks were destroyed, eight units of armored, six units of car technology and eight enemy artillery systems.
Didn't you understand your thoughts?
Of course we're trying to get there, but I doubt
And you can sleep like you want and I'll keep you.
You don't mind if I come?
Maybe you just don't want to see today, so tell me, I understand.
Thanks. We didn't watch TV at home and that's more than 1+1.
I'm going to include the TV here only to listen to the Czech language.
I've finished today the tariff package for the month :)
Can we do this on the phone today?
Buy fabric for firing, cannons, nets for firing
I understand, so I can prepare material in this area.
I'm a little ashamed to ask her, and she's giving us so many pirates.
We'll meet my father later, on duty . . . .
I've read the statement in Facebook, maybe Google something on my own. I think the phone number is enough.
Good day, we're the things you brought, but are there things that we can bring for you in 10 minutes?
I was thinking about the reason for the job.
If Mr. Director adjusts, I can start working the next week because tomorrow before lunch I plan to go to the office to give you documents (if you get it, because it's very big) and on Saturday rain:)
I'm looking for a brigade at first, I really liked chemistry school, I'm learning Chinese so I can find out, I'm dreaming of working on you.
Friends of the past and of the present, friends I don’t know personally, friends of the spirit and mind.
Now you've had some difficult times too.
I've been in contact with many of you for the past month.
Your life, which was never easy without it, turned from the foot to the head, as was the life of every farmer.
Many of you are running from Russia.
And many of you have been admitted to feeling sorry and ashamed because of your country’s actions toward your neighbors.
Because of what they're doing to Ukraine for your name.
Some of you activists have been at risk for a long time, and you've been preparing for a decisive attack.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkas, my very old friend from "Memorial".
Let’s talk about it a little later, as usual, when Sasha gave a final answer. Now we’re going to the ruins.
Others — artists, critics, writers — are impressed by the sudden collapse of your little world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be careful: except for a very few of you -- those who worked in the Memorial, in the New Journal, in the Eho Moscow, in the Meduses, in the Naval and in the lower parts of other places -- would many of you want to do anything against this regime?
In addition to participating in the midgets when they were still happening.
Also read the column of the Russian magazine "Be late for hiding, late for hiding"
If so, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just abstraction?
Perhaps they have been called upon by your persistent indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy, and your passive cooperation, which is likely now a major burden on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always like that.
In 1990 it was a short period when you ruled freedom and democracy, even bloodless, but real.
But 1991 did not appear to be better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you are overwhelmed by such fear that you are looking for salvation behind the king's back, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
As many people as he did not kill, you seem to be safer with him.
Indeed, errors were allowed.
Instead of trying to capture and preserve the CDB archives, as did the Germans from Stasi, you took the soul to the remembrance of Bergin -- and allowed KDB to rely on the bottom, renovate, transform and capture power over the country.
When you were placed in front of a choice between a refugee country and the return of the communists, you were not able to fight for a third option, and you were humbly calmed down.
In 1998, your economy fell, and this meant the end of mass meetings for great social justice or war in Chechnya.
The main concern was to survive.
And then Putin appeared, a young, entrepreneurial, aggressive young man, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
A few of you bought it, but you all voted for it or won't vote for it at all.
When he began to compare Chechnya with the earth again, most of you were attracted to it.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya right away, helping people suffering from a travel anti-terrorist operation, and I saw with my eyes the destruction of Grozny, Katar Yurti, Itum Kali and other cities.
Sometimes I went back to Moscow on my way back to see you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the fears I witnessed: the tortures of the peaceful inhabitants, the killings of children, the soldiers who sold their dead bodies to their families.
You said to me, "Breed, we've already got your check." I remember those words very well.
I said, "Dear, it's not my Chechnya, it's your Chechnya.
It's your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just an idiot.
It's your government bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens."
But no, it was too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic pace of zeros, thought to increase oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the money stolen remains in middle class pockets.
Many of you have become well - off, some rich, and even the poorest have bought a new home and found a better job.
The prices have grown, but is it poor?
Mosque sat on the floor and washed away from the window.
Many of you were shocked by what was happening when a number of opposers — Yuria Czech Republic, Anna Politkovski, Alexander Litvinenko and others — were killed.
However, the case did not go on.
After two terms Putin handed over the position of President Medvediev and himself took the position of prime minister, you see, it was easy for me to take this into account.
After a few months of the Soviet rule in Georgia, most of you were ignored or tortured.
How many of you have I met in the next year on the mountain slopes of Guadeloure, in front of Cazbeg or in the coffee and in the Turkish pools of Tbilisi, until part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that either we or we in the West did a lot of things if they did anything at all.
A little confusion, a little sanctions; but what was meant by the fact that Russia was more critically violating international law when there was so much pressure on Russian oil, gas and the internal market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the heavy 1990s, it was the most important.
However, at the end of 2011, my Russian friends were still breaking up.
When Putin once again moved to places with the Medveidian and took the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided it was too much, and you went to protest.
The name of the Naval has become popular, you haven't gone out of the street for half a year, and the regime finally felt like it's missing the ground under its feet.
Then he hit the answer.
At first, alternative action was organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands stood behind the fences.
Some have received great terms.
"And what could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I still hear it.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Consider what they did two years ago.
Disillusioned by the proselytist president who betrayed their European hopes, they once captured Maydan — and never abandoned him.
They were completely self - conscious and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy him, they began to defend themselves with the help of their fingers, arms, and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protesters went through the attack.
Many died, but they won.
Janukovich became a fugitive, and the Ukrainians returned to democracy, the right to choose the leaders themselves and expel them if they do wrong.
Mydan didn't really like Putin.
That was a bad example.
So, using the total amount, he caught Crimea.
Some of you were opposed, but you benefited from this little.
How many of you were trapped!
As far as I know, 91% of Russia's citizens supported anaesthesia.
Suddenly a new myth was born, and many of you who ignored Putin and his jacket suddenly returned to 180 degrees and began to worship it.
I find it hard to find a reason, because soon after that we stopped talking.
The rest of those who stayed with my friends were mostly silent.
"We don't care about politics," you said.
And you've been hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogues and parks as new after the restoration that Moscow started in 2012, with their bimbosses, general wafa and hipster coffee.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful - and is only getting better.
You've just been paying attention to Syria.
There were terrorists there, right?
The idea of what was there... even a Moscow editor who published my book on Syria, criticized her in the interview, because I didn't really understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw for myself how on the streets of Homs state snipers were shooting at my children in one year.
Among all the citizens of Russia there were only your soldiers who started to bomb thousands of peaceful people in 2015, getting experience for the next major war.
No doubt many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:
"At first they came for socialists, but I spoke because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came to the professor’s office, but I spoke because I was not a member of the professor’s office.
Then they came to the Jews, but I spoke to them because I was not a Jew.
Then they came after me, but there was no one left who could say anything about my protection."
How many of you were told about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But most of them spoke.
Some actually speak now — such as Dmitro Gluhowski, Michelo Shiskin, Michelo Zigar, Maxim Osipov, and others.
Most allow themselves to speak outside the border, some from the middle of the country, such as Marina Ossennikova, risking getting into a new GULAG or classifying the company.
As far as others are concerned, you are best aware of the country in which you live.
So I'm sure you'll understand that when Putin comes along with his customers or what seems very likely if he doesn't have it, he'll take it for you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who are brave, but who are more likely to go out to protest and still have a little less term, but soon they get more serious.
Thousands of you have signed a petition, expressed an objection to the sommere (even a black square in Instagram) or have spoken in private conversations with your colleagues at work.
Sometimes when 10 or even 25 years of free will were given for the anecdotes, they didn’t stay in such a distant past — and now they are very likely to be waiting for you in the future.
Then who will speak for you, and who will be absent?
The example of Ukrainians – even more than 2014 – fears the road mode: they prove that they can fight it.
And what the mind, motivation, and goodness can stop him, which would not have been an enthralled paper on his advantage.
In view of all of this, few in Russia realize it as well as what war is all about.
But you, my friends, know what's going on.
You're reading foreign news online, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine, which you support.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be ready.
You know what it's all about.
Good life in exchange for your silence came to an end.
Your choices are just a hobby, your laws, if you don't pay attention to the repressions, they're worth nothing more than the paper they're written on, your latest free media are no more, your economy is losing faster than I'm writing, you don't have credit cards to buy a ticket on a flight by the border, even if there's still some tickets left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your agreement, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can try or go, or you'll be disappointed.
I doubt you'll see another option.
Still another remains.
Which will eventually break this regime.
And maybe in the circumstances you're upset, you're going to need less than you think.
Think about it.
The ice doesn't burn away from you: because of the economic collapse in Russia, it's most likely to burn in the province, in small cities.
When prices decline and no payments are paid, those who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will go out of the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, my friends.
But if each city is going out on its own, as has been the case on a regular basis, it will not be difficult for it to swallow its own bones.
Organization and coordination will be required. The group will need to be converted to mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool – the Internet that can restrict mode, but which is still working and which can be adjusted under almost any circumstances.
The Naval Organization was fragmented, but you can create other, more informal, more decentralised.
You're so many, you're millions.
The Moscow police can strike up with 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If it goes out over 300 thousand, it'll be crushed.
The army will have to be used, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to the matter?
After everything he had forced them into Ukraine, all because of what he had forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will fall into the fear of the true God; but those who have children will fear of them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid in your place too.
For example, Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happened to those who tried to despise their master, who tried not only to demand freedom but who really tried to get it.
But even if you don’t do anything, the lives of countless people will always be lost.
Your son will shut down a joke in a computer game – and he will be arrested; your daughter will say Internet harassment – and he will be arrested; your close friend will admit mistakes – and he will die in a serial camera under police holes.
This is what has been happening for many years — and it will continue to grow, getting more and more.
So you don't have a choice. If you don't do anything, you know what's going to happen.
Work with cold blood, think strategically, and achieve it.
We were on Friday at work, we were told that we could come in on Monday.
We'll be home at dinner.
How You Treat Me as a Secretary-General
Hey, how often do you go to dinner at a street restaurant?
I'm going to dinner at the street restaurant once a time.
I'll try to explain everything to her.
So we liked it very well and we wanted something better, so it's a better option.
She lived in a place where there were many people, and she got tired of energy.
I feel bad about myself, cough, temperature, loss of voice, weakness and headaches
I have to go to that government
We've already done this, but they said who's registered in flower money only at the end of the month.
At 4:00 a.m. we'll go with the kids to the doctor.
But last night a woman who liked your job wrote to me, and she wanted something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for her new news and I'm going to report it.
Working in the prosecutor's office, I thought I'd be a career, spending a lot of time and energy.
I had a difficult psychological, responsible, mental work in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a lot of wasted time, but it's a life experience.
In my private life, I have been communicative, but I am also deeply involved in the issue of marriage.
There was one man I had to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I think people should love, respect, trust each other to create a family.
Now, I didn't find out.
Good day. Where can you buy the form for Easter (paper or silicon)?
All right, thanks for the advice, then I'll get a witness to Val.
She's got a CDP in her bed state, she's got a low fracture in her hips, a wheelchair in her bed, and she's all turned into a blender.
Mr. Richard, I'm sorry I'm worried about you at a while ago.
But I have important questions for you.
I went to the game room to Natalia today to say hello to her.
The situation was unpleasant for her.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the baby because she said she came to see things and put them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valerie opened our baby room until 19:00 a.m.
Is that really possible?
The working time is up to 16:00.
And finally it's our responsibility.
But I don't have a load to carry. I don't have a very weak Internet.
Good morning, we're all fine) The car works, yesterday the invitations were filled, and I was with the elders before the exam in high school.
It's the hardest thing to figure out how to figure out the geometry.
On Saturday Volodymir helped us.
The old man is studying colleges and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and the wf?
We're so grateful for our life.
Yeah, but I thought you didn't.
We're trying to get the maximum amount by the end of the week to calculate
Situation of Russia's entry into force — Brifing of the Chief Executive Officer of President Oleksia Arestovica (10.04.2022)
