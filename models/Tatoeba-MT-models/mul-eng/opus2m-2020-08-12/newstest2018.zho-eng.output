A travel warning to the State of Missouri is issued by civil authority groups
As a result of the discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the United States has a colouring association (NAACP) that is preparing to travel to Missouri.
"The NAACCP, which came into force on 28 August 2017, called for a series of racist incidents that have taken place in the state of Missouri in recent years, and for all non-American travelers, tourists and the state of Missouri to pay particular attention and take a very cautious attitude when travelling in the state of Missouri," the group declared.
NAACP noted that a recently adopted law in Missouri made it more difficult for people to overcome discrimination and that the law of the State was also to some extent directed at minorities, which led the Organization to issue travel warnings.
The violation of civil rights is taking place on people.
They were beaten or killed because of the color of the car, "The Kansas City Star, NaaCP President of Missouri, told The Kansas Star.
"We've received many complaints, there's no previous number. "
This is the first such warning issued by the organization to a state in the United States.
The organization called for the deaths of Toli Sanders, a 28-year-old black man, from the University of Missouri, for black students.
This year, Sands died in a case of suspicion that he spent fuel during his trip to the state of Missouri and was detained by the police in the state of Missouri without a charge of crime.
It also noted that a recent report by the Office of the Prosecutor-General of the State of Missouri shows that "the possibility of the black drivers in the state being stopped is 75 per cent higher than the white man".
She said: "The advice is to raise people ' s awareness and to warn their families and friends and colleagues about what might happen in the state of Missouri. "
"People need to be prepared whether they take the insurance money to the state of Missouri or let their relatives know that they travel within the state."
According to the latest data on the hate crime report plan of the Federal Investigation Board, in 2015, the State of Missouri reported 100 hate crimes; according to the crime level, the country was registered in country No. 16.
Travel warnings are also a response to the new law in Missouri, which will make it more difficult to prosecute housing or employment discrimination.
In the past, the United States adopted immigration law enforcement laws, which called for the detention of migrants in the local law enforcement sector, the United States Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) indicated that this initiative would increase the number of racial proceedings and issued travel advice to the state of Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Government of the United States against other countries, but the Advisory Group has recently taken this approach to respond to certain laws and trends in the United States.
After the 2015 "Golden Age" increase, the entire film market entered a calmer period in 2016, which could break the overall performance of $440.69 million last year.

BBC says Beijing is the most exciting city in the world.
Referring to the news network on 18 January, British media reported that Beijing may have three thousand years of long history, but it is also rapidly becoming a modern-day city.
This capital of China has a high-speed Internet that has a remarkable face-to-face recognition of software, which has invested enormous resources in human wisdom and has an unwarranted internationalization power, one of the most exciting cities for foreign people who have access to the spirit.
According to the British Broadcasting Company website on 16 January, German civil servant Clemens Sehi said: "If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere after this. " He refers to the words of the song by the singer Frank Sinatra Singer in New York City.
"If Sinatatra lives today, he will probably sing a song like this in Beijing. "He says that living in this city will make you feel "life in the new age," he says.
The elderly live in England, but recently in Beijing, Simon Newton published an article on the 4Corners7Seas personal blog website: "There is a feeling of something great in general, which is hard to tell, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see how it will turn out and want to see evidence."
It is reported that the high-quality Internet of this city and the environmentally friendly environment make daily life easier than ever before.
From Manila, Andy Peniafurt, who currently serves as a deputy member of the Beijing Children ' s website, said: " Beijing is rapidly turning into a cashless society, and the Internet integrates traditional money packages into smart phones to make it easier for everyone to make many transactions. "
It is reported that, however, intelligence phones are only the beginning of Beijing's technology greed, and the Department's identification software has been widely recognized, and many mobile applications use these technologies to account for and pay for access to apartments and offices and even use them to verify the identity of the motor vehicle drivers.
Beijing has recently announced an estimated $138.0 billion of people's currency building an industrial science plant, where there will be 400 enterprises to build and they will focus on the development of technology from biodegradable to automatic car rental.
Food is also at the heart of many important days in China's history, participating in these celebrations being celebrated by foreigners, which is one of the most important social and economic holidays and is one of the most easily attended by foreigners.
She said: "I suggest that I help Chinese friends prepare for the past year to rent an apartment and write a new year's holiday on the door, and that all family members will have a good meal together on the same day, and then spend the rest of the year until midnight and take a new year of bright fire. For strangers, it is a real opportunity to join friends and family tonight."
It is reported that the number of foreigners in Beijing is growing and growing, but Chinese language barriers and the easy exchange between the villagers are easily caused by their lack of full integration into local culture.
She says: "Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but their host country has almost nothing to experience.
"In these so-called "old outer spheres" ("old outer sphere" means that foreigners are mixed only among foreigners, but not in touch with local and local cultures — translators' notes), foreigners are being accommodated in their communities, they are eating in Western restaurants, and there are only foreigners among their friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little bit of general -- it's easier than people might think.
Sehi said: "The two-hour private Chinese lessons or lessons should be adapted to everyone ' s busy schedule every week. "
The short words of a few textbooks can also be helpful in preparing meals at the restaurant or in driving out a car.
It is reported that persistent air pollution is also a fact of everyday life, but in recent years some problems have been addressed by Governments.
The population stressed the importance of outdoor activities during the less often hot months of pollution and the opportunity for the days to be celebrated in a long-standing cave or on an open-aired day-to-day fair.
Noton said: " Beijing is the largest city in China that can be found on the surface, and you can find great art and music activities, exciting nightlife, history, more modern business areas and ancient cave communities. "
The report notes that ageing is increasingly evident in the hindering role of human capital growth, particularly in the North-East region, with annual contribution to human capital growth at 1.28 per cent.
It was welcomed that the current risk of cross-border capital flows was controlled and that the key factors of international balance of payments were still in existence for a long time.
On 17 December, the New Beijing Network (the news media) opened the China People's University of China on 17 December 2016 for rehabilitation and protection of the International Highway Forum for the Rehabilitation and Protection of the World because of its heritage.
The EU Commission in April this year accuses Hong Kong’s mobile phone manufacturer of pre-cancer and Chrome’s search for software that would not allow it to use other Hong Kong applications.
The EU Commission considers this to be harmful to consumers and impedes competition.
The EU controller first asked Kong to respond by 27 July.
If the names of the offence are against it, Hong Kong will face the highest penalty of 10 per cent of its global camp, approximately $44 million.
Kong has not yet commented on this.
Hong Kong also faces EU investigations in order to advance its procurement services in search results.

Summary: In addition to the price recovery caused by the natural nature of the polling engine, the number of currency fluctuations in this cycle are not related to the "dwelling" — the control risk.
From a visible map, Eastern countries have more protection than Western countries, and countries with a global theme are still looking at the legality of digital currency, representing "the risk of the black sun".

With China, Korea and the EU's main market control storm, such as Bittmund, has been pumped into blood since this week's global currency, the price of Bettmund has dropped by $10,000 a week and has been at the top of a single day since the creation of three years.
In addition to the price resurgence generated by the natural nature of the polling machine, the number of currencies in this cycle is not related to the long-standing "dwelling" — the control risk.
In this important context, the Web site HowMuch.net has produced a map showing the legal status and degree of control of the states of the world.
As shown below, the green representative of the legal market in Bitmond; the green representative of the middle market, although not yet publicized by the legislative status of Bitt; the limited market, i.e. the local government tries to use the digital currency by means of red line policy or control; the deep blue representative of Bittmann is defined as an illegal country; and the green is a country that has not yet been evaluated.
(Figure from HowMuch.Net visualization team on 15 January)
The article noted that it was possible to distinguish between the greens of Central Africa and that the traditional Oriental countries were more concerned with the viewpoint of the West side than those of the West.
Russia is the largest country currently defined as the state of illegal Bitmond, China is one of the largest limited markets in Pittmund and India is one of the largest countries in which there has not yet been an assessment of Bettmund and has not yet been issued.
North America and Western Europe are the highest-level areas of acceptance, i.e. the distribution of green balls.
The views of the countries of the Middle East and Latin America have been clearly differentiated from that of the Batman, and the color distribution of the above-mentioned regions is more complex.
Among them are Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Brazil as a legitimate byt money market, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia, and many more Latin-American countries have not yet voted for Bitham.
In the globalized data, 99 countries (or more than 40 per cent) in 246 countries with statistics are aware of the fact that there are no restrictions on trade and use of bitumen, i.e. green and blue areas.
Seven countries (or more than 3 per cent) are limited markets (green), 10 countries (or 4 per cent) are defined as illegal (deep yellow), and 130 countries (or 53 per cent) are still unable to deal more with digital currency information (green).
This indicates that countries with a global theme (53% and more than half) are still observing the legality of foreign currency capital in the country, and represents a very long-standing "black-and-black risk" of foreign currency, some of which may eventually make a legislative decision limiting currency.
The article considers that the global regulatory body has not yet fully understood this new category of digital currency, which may be the main reason why most countries have not yet done so.
Although the " human air " in Bithamn has been increasing at the index level since last year and is not of interest to all countries, some countries may be concerned about the threat caused by local currency or even more about the use of digital currency by criminal organizations.
The Wall Street News has been detailing information on international control over Bitmund since last week, including China's start to fight foreign trade online services on the Platform and the Mobile App, while Korea is still considering closing digital currency transactions, which the EU considers that Bitmund has not yet been widely accepted and warns investors "recorded to bloodless".
The Wall Street Information Editor's selection "Read more about 2018: Globally open currency year?" has been mentioned, from the control, acceptance/critication, and a position adopted, that will be the global currency year 2018.
Russia's large countries, such as Russia, criticized the legal status of the bill, which was also intended to allow officials to issue digital currency routes.
On 8 January, the New York Society (Reporting Secretary-General She Société) took a picture of the New York City's new Kutinio 8 in Nokamp.
Kutinoo adopted a physical examination of Pasa on the morning of that day and signed a contract with Patomeu, President of Basa in 2023.
Then he took a picture of almost 7,000 football players in Nokamp.
According to the Spanish media, Cutino's total or up to €16 million (about €7.77 million) is the first price of the Basa Club and of Western History.
Because Cutino was still in pain, he had to rest for nearly 20 days until he was able to get his own shoes off his back.

The White House of Tranquo is now on its way to free women.
The most sure sign of the regime was when they started attacking the image.
So, in 2003, Saddam? Hussein was carefully planned.
Stephen Miller, one of the key wisdoms of the Tranup government, was to discuss with the U.S. TV news network Jim Acosta (Jim Acosta) what would happen when the president's proposal for strict restrictions on legal migrants was heated up.
Honestly, Miller didn't attack the image himself.
If he did so, a group of shipowners and liberarians would have taken him for life.
But he actually attacked the meaning of images, especially in 1903, when the famous song of Lazarus was built on the base (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller replied to Acosta: "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but free women are a symbol of the United States' freedom to see the world...
It's not part of the original free woman's image. "
In fact, Miller was right, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
This relates to the modern response to the Lazarus ’ death, and the only country seems to invite not only any older migrants but also the poorest among the poor: "Your hunger, your poverty, or the desire for freedom of expression of people in your group, and/or those suffering from the sea you own. "
There's no "rejection of the sufferer" on our screen.
Miller had not done his work in writing, and he made it clear that these people would not be welcomed by the United States in the Tranian era.
This conflict on the meaning of images is part of a wider political and cultural war, which is actually a conflict with the spirit of the United States.
Lazarus (Lazarus) and her activities, after her death, to bring her speech to the attention of her friends on the ground, clearly indicate that their participation was highly political.
The purpose of this poem is to express the link between France and the United States of America through the passage of an old text as a woman of the free God.
Lazara changed its meaning: women are no longer depicted in her lips, and she wants to vote.
She gave herself a very different name: the mother of the flow.
It is a successful political change in women's rights, and it is a devastating fight against American nationalism.
As the Rasa Road changes the image, the right-hand man has always wanted to change it.
Rush Limbaugh, a prominent speaker, was a temporary bather who in 2010 felt that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, but he was now a new early conservative and brought the U.S. fireflies to the foolish world: "Free woman is a brave woman."
She was going to take the fire of freedom from the United States to other parts of the world.
Fire doesn't shine the way of the United States."
It's not unusual that Linbo was actually driven by something.
The meaning of the image depends entirely on the perspective of knowledge.
The most powerful practice in Lazarus's life is to see it. When tired, poor, and desperate people are able to see it on board the ship after a long and often terrible journey.
From a physical standpoint, this involves those seeking asylum, who have the opportunity to improve their outlook on the world.
Her pictures convey to them and they need the hope they hear and the real purpose they have heard.
Of course, it's not the view that Miller and Tranpus wanted to admit.
Not for the sake of light, but for the enjoyment of the only source of strength.
In 2006, Sajuy became the first Chinese person to enter into a contract with the headquarters of the United Kingdom.
2017 World Cup: Neil Black
Elidh Doyle.
Nier, Executive Director of the British Trade Association, Black, said that a team of 16 superpowers from the World Trade Group would make a significant contribution to "the country team".
The number of Sugland activists who were selected to participate in the five-week opening of the 2017 World Cup in London has created the largest number of events in history.
In the view of Blake, "Sugland is achieving unusual development", British field activists must learn from the middle.
"We accept and try to understand this, and we will keep going until we succeed," Black said.
"I'm looking for people at the Sugland Sports School who think it's related to them.
The Sudanese peasants believe this to be related to them.
The British Trade Association considers this to be related to them.
That's what people on the street think.
"In any case, it's all very embarrassing."
Several Sugland field activists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, were chosen to be the leader of the team at 5,000 meters away from Mo Farah.
"Eried's a little tired.
It's hard to believe her speech," Black said.
"Many rural activists, whether they live or train anywhere, go from door to door with pride and go from door to door.
Arid's natural inputs are beautiful and real. "
The head of the federal bank, which will take part in the fifth World Cup of 400 metres of cross-border competition, said that 16 of the British National Teams had the Sugrene, which was "unthinkable".
In the past, the largest number of actors in the World Cup in the Sogland are seven, namely the number of tournaments achieved in 1983 and 2015.
She was created in the last year by five British records and two European records.
She's going to take part in a 1,500-metre and 5,000-metre project contest.
She had achieved a good success in the course of the 1500-metre race, and she had won a victory in the pre-election and O'O'S cycle in Britain, respectively.
Doyle recalled that she was in the first World Cup, and the only one in the team was Lee McConnell.
The commander said that she was very proud that so many of her colleagues were not only members of the team, but in some cases she would also face the challenge of winning a prize and enter a decision-making contest.
"The special position of the Head of the National Army is that it has been elected by other members of the National Army. So, knowing that you have chosen your teammate's vote to seek a very unusual achievement, it is a great honor for me, anyway," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the members of the Sugland.
It just shows us how far we've gone.
And they're all the old field activists here, that's what they're doing here.
How's my captain speaking?
Well, I think it's great.
I was just referring to this fact, that is, in this case, we are very lucky because we are holding a world competition in the capital.
Therefore, it is very important for us to support the capital and to make it bigger because of our return to the Olympics.
I'll get a second chance to participate in the contest, and there'll be a lot of talk about it."
In 2016 there were 18 million workers, up to 1218 million employees, with 21 per cent increase.
Critics on their faces: If you cannot bear the responsibility of the voters, don't compete for public service
Our father knows what bad media are doing.
All Americans love Washington, but soon the newspapers began to beat him hard, from domestic policy to political principles, and not one left.
He's very hot for these criticisms, no doubt.
But he didn't scream at those critics.
Because early in 1783, Washington had said, "The freedom of speech is deprived -- we will be killed like sheep in silence and in darkness."
This reminds me of Larry Hogan, governor of the state of Milan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have been excommunicated and eliminated by at least 450 people because they have published their views on his face-to-face official page.
This was the case with him earlier this week, the U.S. Civil Liberties Union.
The officials of the Government considered this procedure to be too draft and reported on their strong opposition on the Internet: "Who cares?"
Many people say, "This is just a face book."
But it's important.
This is especially important, because it's the same guy as Hogan.
This is one of the common party members of a majority of the state, and he is also warmly welcomed.
In 50 national states, he received the best estimate.
Hogan isn't an activist.
He's stable in control of the state of Milan. He strictly adheres to the rules.
He was also very much better than the main way of putting his face in contact with the electoral community, playing the first stage after his treatment on the master's page.
It is therefore not necessary for those who come to the main comments of the Governor's side, and ultimately very dangerous. This page is a public forum, which is an official management platform for staff who are being paid tax.
In a "Washington Post" interview, Hogan's speaker, Amelia Shass, defended the Government's actions, and she felt that their comments were a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a clumsy.
However, they described it as a flood or a global flood of landmines.
The Washington Post has spoken to people in Hong Kong.
They are only ordinary people in the leadership dialogue they have chosen: they are teachers, small businessmen and priests, and they are not a flood of water.
They are reluctant to express their comments in depth, with respect, and not to go down.
If this priest refers to "the Holy Book" in his pocket, he calls attention to his heavenly faith.
Lakshimi Salma Ramani, chief lawyer in Bui, Milan, did not have a practice of witchcraft, but she asked about hate crimes.
She wrote in the part of her commentary on the story of the Washington Post, "I warmly comment that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also do not like to make comments on the same subject because they are directly ignored by some people who think they are what they are from the public mind rather than make them a citizen of a proud nation. "
The so-called "closed waste information explosion" of government officials appears to be "intention of claims" in others.
In the face of the book, it is easy and easy to change the information, and only one critic or one negative comment is needed.
It is also clear that it is far more effective than in the past, that in the past century it is necessary to send out officials to collect and destroy newspapers that contain criticisms or arrest or vote against protesters.
But that's really what's going on right now, but it's on the digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of complaining about others in facebooks and other social media.
President Tranup is being prosecuted by the Twitter user, because he has beaten them on Twitter.
A cross-border decision took place last week in the state of Virginia on such issues.
According to regional judge James C. Carcairis of the U.S. City of Alaska, the President of the London Supervisory Committee violated the first amendment from her face-to- face-to-face form.
Matt Bewin (R), Governor of Kentucky, was also taken into account by the United States Civil Liberties Union for the use of facial books and toilets.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington’s time, the cost of mail and the Internet had similar effects.
The number of newspapers rose four times between 1776 and 1800, and there was a strong criticism of his leadership.
And even at that time, Washington also had a flood against him.
They used Urikla, Valerius, Belize, and Podunds to write a false letter to the press critical of Washington's decision-making.
According to the historical document collected on the website of George Washington, his office was dismissed and his attitude to the "Breathment of the King of England with the United States of America and the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation" that he had signed with Britain was criticized.
But he didn't scream at them.
Freedom of expression, freedom of expression and expression are the foundation of this country.
And real leaders need to accept this.
The city's heavy windmills are moving people's emotions.
The purchase of restrictions is a strong communication between many urban property control policies.
In May 2017, Ginnian issued a policy of equal purchasing policies for local residents of the same household for the same period of half-yearly contributions;
In June, the U.S.A. policy provided for a three-year university degree degree certificate of qualifications and employment certificates to be available at home.
Subsequently, the policy code states that "the university students can purchase less than 20 per cent of the market price";
In July, it was provided that only young people of the University of Field University and above were students and that the certificate of qualifications could be applied for as a family.
In addition, there are mountains, cities or regions on the coast, such as the seaports, have also been set up to introduce relevant policies and to reduce the threshold for the purchase of houses.
It is believed that this is in fact the most important importance of these housing policies for large cities, especially for the population and for the population, especially for the population.
Some even believe that this means that the time has come to cancel the "restrictive procurement" of the building.

That's really a special reminder, we'll always remember."
Back in Tunisia, Gary Ol, he was just 50 years old this year, and he also participated in the European regular youth tournament.
This was the first time he attended the Sugran Golf competition since 2013.
Helensburger Ol said: "It will be more important for you to go home to the House of Commons.
You want to do good, but you can feel the extra pressure.
I'm really having fun again. I've been fighting golf.
I am satisfied with the present situation."
The three groups in the area were the winners of the former Grand Instructor Ian Voussan and the regular champions Paul Brodgest, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNutty.
On the ground, six Swedeers, Ol and former leader Sam Tolens, were two of them, four of whom were Andrew Odcon, Steven McCallister, Bill Juan and Ross Drammond.

In Beijing, 22 August, the head of the Office of Environmental Oversight Services of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China introduced 57 cases of continuing punishment in total, and the new revision of the Environmental Protection Act, which was implemented earlier this year, clearly reflects China ' s environmental enforcement force.
At present, environmental law enforcement agencies in China can be used to monitor environmental violations by day-to-day punishments, arrests, limitations on property and transfer of administrative detentions, and to punish environmental crimes in conjunction with judicial bodies.
In August, in China, a total of 335 cases were carried out jointly; a limit of 177 cases were imposed; 189 cases were transferred to administrative detentions and 166 cases were transferred to suspected environmental pollution crimes.
Of these, 7 continued punishments are implemented by the river N.S., and China is currently in the process of being fully integrated from border control and comprehensively reinforcing environmental pollution management.
While economic pressure has shown, the Chinese Ministry of Environment has been clearly demonstrated earlier, China should properly address the position of environmental protection in economic development, increase "green strength", increase economic pace, reduce environmental security and play an important role in improving the economy.

"We used to cover our bodies with trees."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, where 28 per cent of people live under the poverty line, as well as in the highest and lowest areas of education and education for children in Asia.
But it's also the Chinese of Indonesia.
There are about 153,000 people in the Paniere area. The world's largest, the most profitable gold miner Brasberg is just 60 miles from here, which is located at the headquarters of Félippe McMorland.
In 2015, only about $33 billion of gold and silver mines were discovered here.
In addition, the resources of Papua New Guinea are very rich and the estimated value is $780 billion.
However, these rich resources are also a source of tragedy for the Cubans, and strong military forces of Indonesia are therefore able to keep them under constant pressure.
A 2005 survey "New York Times " revealed that, between 1998 and 2004, Philippe paid nearly $2 million to local military and military personnel and troops, with a single officer of up to $150,000.
The people of Babab became increasingly stronger in their demand for independence, which threatened this rich man, and they suffered cruel treatment.
According to the defenders, more than 500,000 Bababians have been killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass murder in the 1970s in the Baba tribe has increased as a result of genocide.
One year ago, the Indian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A report in 2016 "We will lose all evidence of the evils of the past year, such as extrajudicial killings, which another report claims to be rape and power particularly universal -- as well as the cruel oppression of peaceful tourism.
“Violence is happening every day, so it is difficult to calculate the number of victims. ”
Baba's resources have come to a large number of immigrants outside of Indonesia, and pressure has begun.
There are 83 per cent of the population of the province as Christians, but there have been changes in its population structure since its arrival.
The small value of the cows' food is sold by cadmium and cadmium, which is used to produce fruit.
Locals are trying to fight.
24-year-old Pania's local Apos Yeu moved to the province of Chapra, where he explained that "the immigrants began selling beef and veal at a lower price than local Bababians.
This has resulted in the loss of their market for local Bababians - women of Bababa (Mama) " .
President Soko Vidododo (also known as Zokovi) in his 2014 campaign to address the problem of inequality and abuse of powers.
This former wooden road to the palace of President Jakarta was supported by 27 regions throughout 29 regions — including Pania.
But nothing changed in Baba. Today, locals feel betrayed.
In particular, "We've broken our heart, we voted in 2014 to Zokovi, hoping he could achieve our will and restore justice."
In fact, after only two months of serving in Kosovo in 10 months, Pania suffered the most terrible nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 of Ennarotali children sang Christmas songs outside of the fire, and two Indonesian soldiers rushed over to the motor vehicle.
Surprising kids told them to open the car.
According to the local priest, Ahuat Tibba, one of the soldiers was not satisfied with their words and then brought back four soldiers.
Victims and observers said these drunk soldiers were shooting at these children with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot these kids.
Sixteen-year-old Yuliannus Jammin was severely beaten and beaten.
Within hours, nearby government agencies were electing the Committee to build a fire in the building and the second day's event was refurbished.
Some 1,000 young Baba men, women and children, gathered together at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre, requested justice.
They're wearing their traditional beads, jumping the waita dance of the Baba's Mee Pago tribe, and they're running around and modeling.
Some of the protesters started throwing stones into the military.
According to an official document seen in "The Age" magazine, while the situation continued to worsen, soldiers received orders from the inside radio: " If the crowd is opposed more than three times, immediate shoots " but this document has not been issued to local media.
56-year-old Jeremias Kajama was head of Kego Koto Street, Ennarotali, where he felt that there would be a danger, that he would call on people to remain calm and ask them to come home.
But no one's willing to hear him.
He stood at the door of his colorful wooden house and told me "When I came back, my left arm was suddenly shot."
Kajama still doesn't know who fired the gun, but he says the bullet came from the army.
He also said, "It was so bad, they fired a lot of guns."
According to the local brother, Olf Yull, he saw the gun and saw three of the Orf Yulls.
Yuhannes, sad to say, "The magazine of the age, "I ran past him to see if he was not.
I found he's dead... and I kissed him."
Chief Chief of Police of Baba, Yuje Mend, told the press that his sub-mission was only in the "protection" police station, as the police were attacked.
We must defend ourselves when a person threatens to kill us when the Chief of Police, Pugio Sulisti, is a speaker of the Papua New Guinea Police in 2015.
It's a matter of life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and more were injured.
The next day the news of this murder was broadcast in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zukovi, in Chapra, made a statement in which he expressed deep sympathy for the victims ' families and vowed to address the abuse of authority remaining in the history of Baba.
He said, "I wish this case could be resolved as soon as possible, so there will be no such thing in the future."
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Willando, said that he was going to establish a non-judicial mechanism to address the question of the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the reason for the delay is almost there.
He said, "Most of the violations took place a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The focus is that we are committed to solving these violations, but this also requires a process."
Then, on 5 June in Jakarta, Vilando went against the "time" magazine dialogue and said he had not planned to establish a complaint mechanism in Baba.
On the contrary, he said, "Everything will be resolved by law."
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Vilando on more than 1,000 deaths in an independent vote against East Timor in 1999, but he said that 11 cases of human rights violations in the Baba region had been resolved, including the Pannie incident.
The family of the victims of the Panie incident was ashamed of these words.
Yuhannes said, "For the past three years, I have had four interviews, but there has been no progress. "
Years later he said, "I'm tired."
He's still living in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army, afraid of being shot."
His brother Yokabus also thinks that the people of Pania are afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
He said, "After the body was buried, the army came to see me."
The gun didn't stop.
The second day, the Indian police attacked the village in Pani-Ai's neighborhood.
A construction company manager refused to help transport a disabled man to a hospital, a conflict occurred between the two parties, one death and 17 injuries, including children.
24-year-old Ravianus Dowu died on his way to the hospital when he was fishing near the river.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company's office.
The police said the villagers were throwing stones at the police, so the police were warning them.
But the IDF (Individual Military Police) started shooting at people and one person was killed.
"We were always afraid that they would respond." He lived near the hospital and saw the injured being rushed into the hospital.
"I've been hiding in the house for two days."
The DIA Parliament has called for the police to be brought to justice and for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the area.
Panie has always been a place for the Government of Indonesia.
Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal are experiencing a lack of effective development, which has spread to the central peaks of the Pani-Aiwa.
Many have joined the Free Baba Movement (OPM), which is a rebel army, claiming to protect the rights of the Bababians through the proliferation of attacks and attacks against Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the Free Baba Movement were born in Pania, including Tadius Yuji and Daniel Yudas Kukhaya.
Therefore, in recent years thousands of people have been arrested by the military for their "protection of the sovereignty of the State" and deliberately detained.
Some people haven't been here yet.
In the eyes of the Bababians, Panya is a "fortunely forgotten" place.
Poverty is growing.
Ennarotali's sales are less expensive and locals can't afford it.
It's not even possible to get out of here.
There they will grow all that they can eat, mainly red and some fruit and vegetables.
The seeds are women's work, each woman can care for four or five red spots.
They usually collect most of the leftovers and place the leftovers on the local market.
Ten Red Reds are worth 10,000 Indian Rubies (75 meters).
As time went by, economic inequality had spread to the local Bababians and new migrants, and the number of migrants had increased considerably since the opening of the new route to the airport in Nbarre.
The current small amount of work has often fallen into the hands of more educated and rich migrants.
Bababians have very little money or the necessary skills to operate competitive companies.
Mr. John Goby, President of the Pannies Council, said "Young people don't want to stay in this village because there's no work here or money."
Baba and the world.
In addition, the restrictions on international media reporting remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudie and Basel Lun were expelled from Baba because they "not with the relevant institutions", even though they had been given permission to film.
According to UNOH Vice-Chairperson for Asia, Félim Kaen stated that Zukovi ' s withdrawal of the reporting restrictions had not been fulfilled in order to promote transparency and development.
In a statement, he stated that " if foreign journalists try to report to Baba and Sibabaa, which are not fully occupied in the eastern part of Indonesia, they are at a new risk: refusal of visas and entry into the blacklist " .
No media surveillance means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is essentially limited to neighbouring countries in Barbados.
In March, 6 Pacific States — Tonga, Peru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands — requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate " universal human rights violations of Baba " , including the Pannies shooting case.
These countries have also supported the free Baba movement.
Armanata Nassil, a speaker from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, did not care about the group, and he told the newspaper Jakarta that " Indonesia is still implementing a democratic system and freedom of the media, so it is difficult to conceal evidence of human rights violations. "
Local people want more foreign Governments to pay attention.
According to one informed man, on 4 May, the delegation of the Netherlands Human Rights Ambassador Kess Juan Bartage visited Chapra when the local people broke their silence and asked "We want freedom." He also attended the meeting but apologized.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but the Bababians claim that they are not very likely to vote for Kuwait.
The President of the Council of the People ' s Republic of Goba says " The purpose of Zokovi is good, but he is all around the people involved in the Pani Ae shooting. "
He wanted Zekovi to know that the people of Pania were not only at risk of living in the armed forces, but that there was nothing to do with education in the region and the lack of public health services.
Like other Bababians, Gobi said that their vote on Kosovo was his duty to repay him.
He said, "They don't need money, they need justice."
Even in the face of threats and threats, the families of the victims of the Panyea shooting continued to act as a last-significant resistance against the body of the victim in front of the military police.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they will not forget their sins.
Yokabus says, "My family has been killed.
What else can we do?"
Sofia, a well-equipped customer, has been developing a large-scale housing industry-based base for hard-to-catch cards. On 10 February 2017, the Chinese witness court approved the first application of a limited unit of housing companies in the Broadway Stock Exchange and issued a small pass on the market platform, which had just been adopted by the European People ' s Party over 20 days earlier.
In the view of the business community, as soon as goods are ready to be moved from the market to the capital.
A new year's event was launched to set up a typical representation card house in the area of residence, attracting the attention of the entire housing industry.
The Beijing Times reported that the three-star electronics company's second week released the first set of auto-mobiles that had been developed with the Harman International, as well as information entertainment solutions, which was an important initiative for the company's access to the electronic market.
Three stars got Hamman International about a year ago.
On this week's exhibition of consumer electronic products (CES) in Las Vegas, three stars issued a touch-on warning, a road warning, a camera that controls navigation, which was developed in cooperation with Hamman.
The three-star plan began to issue this year this series of motion picture systems, which is built on engineering such as automatic learning and expansion of materials.
At the same time, three stars have shown "digital tapes", even if the driver is not the owner of the vehicle and can make vehicles more personalized, which allows users to download information from moving equipment and from the doors.

The fires don't start again.
On Friday, a fire took place in a world’s highest housing building and forced hundreds of residents to flee the building at 337 meters high and 79 high-level buildings.
It's a second-floor high-level building fire within two short years, and it's just happening in Moseta called "fire".
The building has been disintegrated and no reports of injury have been received and no reasons have been identified.
"We're sleeping, and then we're woken up, and people started screaming.
We run down the building and run from 50 to about 10 minutes," a resident named George told the street.
The civilian defence authorities of Dubai stated that the fire forces had destroyed around 4 p.m. at local time (Ginwig Standard Time 0000) and were being processed for the building.
The Government expressed its efforts to provide shelter for affected persons.
This event may bring back to the attention of the world about the use of outer wall material security in high-level buildings.
A study carried out after the fires which took place in 2015, found that most of the damaged objects were covered and used outdoor walls.
The British police have already indicated that they believe that the issue of the heating and surface system of the London Grenfer Building may have been caused by the rapid expansion of fire in June, which resulted in about 80 deaths.
The Williams Car also indicated that Masa might return, although he had already announced withdrawal.
On 9 January, the opening of the South Ouija board of the Republic of Korea was only one month away, and with the hot and intense efforts of the Ouija board from the south to the north, there was a growing rise in the country ' s greenhouse gas emissions.
This long-standing Korean conference is expected by the Korean government to bring a "flower egg" for a month when it falls into the Pacific Ocean.
On 1 November last year, San Francisco arrived in Korea.
The heat from St. John's fire is directly reflected in the sale of the door-to-door tickets to the San Francisco Museum.
Just two months ago, the sales rate of the IP was only 32 per cent, and the rate of sales of the IP was more than 4.3 per cent, and the low rate of sales was one of the most worrying external concerns about the public of the IP.
However, as the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment of the ICSC recently predicted to the press, "as the temperature in the country of Korea increased, the situation of sale of the door will soon change".
According to the Korean media, as at 3 January, the sales of the IPO had reached 64 per cent and the sales rate of the IPO had also been cut by 50 per cent.
In order to encourage foreigners to attend the Korean Cross, the Ministry of Justice of Korea also announced 8 days that foreigners visiting Korea will extend their stay in Korea for a maximum of 120 days.
The investigation found that more than one fifth of U.S. passengers were carrying contravention aircraft.
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 per cent of passengers had deliberately or indirectly carried illegal goods through the U.S. Transport Safety Authority, of which at least 6 per cent of passengers had deliberately carried contraventions or other cargo.
Less than 1 per cent of passengers declared that they had found the wrong guns, ammunition or explosives to travel.
This survey of more than 1,000 people was conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc., and it also found that young travelers are more likely to ignore the rules.
Recognizing that there were 19.7 per cent of the respondents who deliberately tried to take TSA-containing explosives in response to the attack, compared with less than 15 per cent of the X-generation population.
The most common intention is that TSA security personnel are food and food.
More than 3 per cent of those who admitted that they had deliberately carried the goods to safety, while 2.2 per cent of women ' s and 3.7 per cent of men ' s respondents had also indicated that they had deliberately carried contrabanded drugs.
The company claims this investigation to be a number of passengers from the country to be informed of the number of persons carrying an accident and of the intention to carry prohibited goods over the aircraft inspection aircraft.
It is not surprising that the most likely person who has been carrying the goods is — deliberately or deliberately — the most frequent ones.
However, the company noted that the TSA guidelines were somewhat complex.
People don't usually know what they can carry and how many fluids they can carry.
So the TSA's best payment is that it's not weird.
People once thought that TSA might have turned books into contrabands.
The domestic aircraft is permitted to carry liquids, but the international aircraft is not allowed to carry them.
The President of the U.S. Environment Agency, Prutt, changed his idea of reducing regulations for the Obama era
After a day of prosecution in 15 states, the Director of Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Prutt, changed his decision to postpone the implementation of the regulations on the reduction of air pollution in the Obama era.
This change was proposed by Prut because, compared with the previous Government, the Environmental Protection Agency could respond more quickly to the needs of the state-run institutions.
He did not mention the legal challenges raised by the Federal Court of Appeal to his former position.
The focus of the dispute was to set a deadline for the start of the 2015 Earth-based ozone standards for the states on 1 October.
In June, Prut announced that he would be delayed for about a year in order to allow the Environment Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid "intrusion of local decision-making or impede economic growth".
Prior to the appointment of President Donade Tranpu, Prut was the Chief Prosecutor General of the state of Ukraine, who had long opposed the strictness of environmental legislation.
Since its arrival in Washington, Prut has been reversing or delayed legislation against the chemical and fossil fuels industry.
The sudden reverse on Wednesday was a latest legal obstacle to the Puritan regime ' s return agenda.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeals ruled that the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency had exceeded its authority to delay the implementation of the provisions required by the Government of Obama to monitor and reduce carbon monoxide.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Prut proposed a major shift in his attitude towards ozone standards and expressed the commitment of the Environment Protection Agency to strengthen its commitments to work with the States to achieve a complex process.
Prut stated that " under the administration of the former Government, the Environmental Security Agency is often unable to meet the deadlines set by the Environmental Protection Agency, and is again agreed upon by agreement to establish a timetable for the prior work of the Environmental Protection Agency several times.
" We do not believe in the rules of procedure and we are serious about the deadline.
We are also serious about the rules and authorities. "
However, the statement made by the Environment Agency indicates that Prut could be used again to ensure that the provisions are consistent with "good policies and best information available".
Co-Parties in the National Assembly are promoting a wide range of revisions of ozone-depleting regulations.
The parliamentary bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
This measure has not yet been voted in the Senate.
The U.S. Security Council was held this week under the leadership of the Union of State Prosecutor Eric Schmendman, who was charged with the intention of maintaining legal pressure.
“The reverse of the U.S. Environment Agency – following our prosecution – is a significant victory for the health and safety of the 670 million New Yorkers, which has a direct impact on the communities of more than 1.15 billion Americans.”
In California, Copenhagen, Tarawa, Irenoa, Elin State of Estonia, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New Mexico, Ouija board of directors, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and Colombia, the list is included in this case.
The ground ozone is a vehicle, power plant, oil plant, chemical factories and other sources of emissions that are produced to respond to the radiation in the atmosphere.
This will cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive populations, resulting in thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health promoters and environmentalists welcome the amazing transformation of Prutt.
The Biodiversity Centre stated: " It is disturbing that this conventional measure has been subjected to great pressure from sectoral officials who protect our air needs. "
" We must fight against the thought movement of the Government of Tranup to meet contaminants and special interest groups. "
In addition to the external factors of the return of the price of the stake, it is difficult for businesses to go down the path of lowering costs.

On the morning of 13 July in Beijing, the U.S. Somaltus submitted a case to the District Court of East Texas in which he alleged that he had violated an electronic technology patent applied for in 2010.
The company had previously used the same expertise to prosecute Wyatts, Alliances, Three Stars, Sony and East.
The case alleged that iPhone 6s and similar fruit-producing equipment violated the U.S. patent No. 7,657,386, which is called "Comprehensive power supply system".
The complainant wishes to receive cash compensation, or to receive patents for breach equipment declared after the judgement.
From the trial, the prosecutor seems to believe that iPhone's speedy operation violated the company's patent.
The iPhone will quickly fill up the electricity to 80 per cent and then recharge the electricity.

However, they have been successful in reaching external agreement on this patent with the Fort and J.A.

On 27 January, in a call to President Enrique Péna Nuto, Mexico, Tranup urged him to stop openly expressing that he would not pay for the construction of the border wall.
It was reported that the President of the United States was displeased at his open assault on the wall and that Petran had said to him: " Don't tell the media. "

The Mortuary case: The activists are again being subjected to the privatization of racism and the promotion of justice
A fort star train in 1948 passed through a group of spectators from the small city of Menro, Georgia, heading towards a small Mork Bay.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, and a white man with a gun on his way to the front of the car before arriving at the bridge.
This guy's head -- a middle-aged man with a piece of paper -- breathes a nose and eyes into the windshield.
The passengers in the car are terrified.
"We want to-- Roger!" that man ran.
"Get him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged from his previous guest seat to cry for silence.
Fortunately, on July 22, this terrible scene was just a rehearsal.
However, when Roger's shoes were put on his pockets, almost all the audiences around him were really breathing.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Mordong, and two more events have occurred on the night of the private death of three K parties - Roger and Dossey Malcon, and George and Mere Dossey - in 1946.
No one's been charged with murder.
"Although we know who they are, although we have seen them in the community, they have not been arrested in recent years, which is really hard to believe," said Tylon Brooks, who helped organize this rehearsal.
"This is the point of history and the burden of our souls."
At 71 years of age, Brooks was a former parliamentarian and life-sustainment activist in Georgia.
For him, replay was an interesting call, reminding people of Menro communities every year that injustice had never been corrected.
"We want to prosecute, we want to finish, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he said.
" Unless we receive justice, we will not have to be healed and reconciled. "
On 27 July 1946, a test officer was on the body of a Mortgage Private Prison Victim.
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigations, which has received information from U.S. national broadcasting companies, 50 men from Menro and surrounding villages are suspected of being involved in private punishment.
But none of them have been charged.
Although suspects have been in a state of extrajudicial situation for decades, civil rights activists have shown that the double motive for the implementation of the private punishment throughout the city is well known: political and sexual.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in the state of Georgia to vote for the first time at the beginning of the election later that summer.
According to the Federal Investigations Agency statistics, at about the same time, black people shot Agroje Malcolm at White Master Bannet Hester in a fight seemed to be for a woman.
Brooks said that the city's story was that Hester slept with Malcolm's wife, and her baby wasn't her husband.
According to the Federal Investigation Board, on 25 July 1946, a prominent white man, Mr. Roy Harison, spent $600 on bailing Malcolm out.
Dosance and Sister Merey and George Dorsie took him to prison.
However, when they returned from prison and soon reached the Mordvinia, a group of private criminals surrounded the car.
"The fact is, it's Harrison's organization and ordered this murder," a FBI report concluded.
" It is clear that there is fraud between the state and local law enforcement authorities, that they not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence but also concealed the identity of the witnesses. "
Brooks is very clear.
He said, "This is a voter. "
"They were killed by the killer and sent information to the blacks of this community: 'If you register and vote, you will face the same conclusion. '
For the past ten years, Cassandra Green has been responsible for conducting the annual rehearsal of the private prison in Moslem.
She's a well-founded character of her hands, her touching heart, with a deeply racist background, and many people hope that such racism will no longer exist in the United States.
It's hard to see, not harder, but Green says it's the key.
"We don't want to talk about private punishment, because it makes us face everyone's shame," she said.
"But if you don't listen to me or I don't hear my own experience, I can't establish a relationship with you."
This year's show started in June, and on the first day, there were nearly 30 players -- dozens of white people -- the rest of them black -- sitting in one house listening to a well-equipped show.
Wed Malk was the joint leader of Green.
For years, he's been playing the role of three K parties, but he says it's not easy.
"I feel bad because I'm not such a person," said Malgo.
"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive, because we don't want to go back to that era."
In the room, the actors from Roger Malcolm and Bannet Hester, Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, trained their speech.
At the beginning of this game, Malcolm called out and went to Hessette, and he was so angry about his wife that he fell asleep.
"I said, get out of my land!"
Lascona's back on the road.
Then they broke up.
Then everyone (at least all black actors) shouted.
Green's the best.
"What's going on?" Rascona asked.
He's surprised. He's confused.
Did I play too much?
"No," Green laughed.
"I just don't say 'aye' when white people come back. "
"Yes," another black actor interviewed.
"Your words must be strong."
That's how the power in the room has changed; the feeling of friendship has gone unsatisfied.
Everyone tried to do this not only to play this game but also to commemorate four victims.
The scene begins again.
This time, Rascona said this, "When you're angry, you're strong.
No one's laughing.
The replay is strong and quickly over.
It's a silence. It's a silence.
A woman who was dressed in a black dress standing next to the performer, wearing the "extraordinary reality" of Billy Hackerie's dress.
She's got another word.
In addition to a hundred miles, about 40 people are standing in constant contact with the water and the eye.
Nearly half of the population are black and white.
There was a show of a couple from New York Isaaca, and a lot of people lived near the street.
Brooks took them to the tombs at Malcolm and Dossey, which took about eight hours, and everyone was suffering from an inadequate heat in Georgia.
Until now, the killers are still a fraud. But now, standing on the same land where the private punishment takes place, the air is full of tension.
When the last song was sung, Green was invited to the body of close inspectors.
The children are so low, they look at false blood and body, and they're talking too much.
"They're not really dead," said a little boy, as if reminding himself.
A few minutes later, Greene thanked the crowd, and then the show ended.
The performer opens a private trial and wipes out his eyes.
Bradshaw has three K party heads.
Nick Rascona had two of his colleagues crying in their pockets; the emotion in the show finally touched him.
"It's okay," one of them said.
"We know your heart isn't like that.
You're doing this for a reason."
Then the audience sat down and ate dinner with the performers.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta spoke to black women they had just met and talked about the rehearsal.
Dennis Duplinski found it hard to find words that she saw.
"It's hard to imagine the horrible words and deeds that you say and do, because they look like you," she said.
"For me, it really makes me think I'm still in prison," she adds, "and now it's just called a police gun. "
In the room, Tylon Brooks is sitting on the table looking at the painting and referring to civil rights.
He says he's already started the show next year.
"Replay is a way of encouraging people, as it describes the terror we have experienced, but it is also very educational," he said.
" If you don't learn from it, this may happen again.
Those who don't study, who don't know their own history, are destined to resurface."
With regard to natural climate market reform, the importance of the "independence of the network" reform is not stated, but there is also greater tension and conflict.
Newspapers were informed by the North-West Group at 11.25 p.m. that an explosion of 13 workers had occurred during the freezing of small grouped companies in the city of Gothenburg, in the north of the River.

America: Scientists at the University of the Chinese Air Force Engineering Research Satellite for the Cleaning of Space Wastes
On January 18th, the United States media reported that China's scientists had made a very innovative proposal to use a large-scale solar system to clean up the messy earth roads and to destroy old satellites and their space debris.
According to the U.S. Press Week, on 15 January, researchers from the University of the Chinese Air Force Agency prepared a paper entitled "The Clearing of the Sky Layers of Small Space Deformities" that described how space debris could be less stimulated and without such a large fraction.
It has been reported that over the years, space debris has been a matter of concern to international space agencies, and the United States Space Agency has considered a number of alternative programmes to detect and eliminate debris.
The way in which large-scale space debris is cleared includes large networks for cleaning and collecting waste, and can be used to extract the particles that they attract. China's scientists have conducted a real research on light bulbs and have concluded that this will be an effective way to clean Earth orbits.
The paper ' s summary states: " (Study of research) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris technology for the light-up of the space platform. "
A 2014 study by the U.S. Anti-Fraud Company Lokhid-Martin found that there are about 200 threats every day for satellites operating along the road.
The high-speed cuts of the Earth orbit movement are considered a serious threat to future space missions, and experts from the European Space Agency are described as "a threat of death".
According to the U.S. "M.M.M." website on January 17th, the space is basically empty, but the earth's atmosphere is getting more and more occupied. Every satellite we send into space will eventually turn into another orbital piece of space, and as time moves, these debris will be collected.
More and more, some of the satellites that are normally operated are still at a higher rate than those that have been hit by a broken satellite, thus damaging or destroying a million-dollar investment.
It is reported that all space agencies have developed plans to clean space waste in the future.
NASA is considering reducing the rate of drop-down of debris using explosive gas to keep it out of the way, and Europe is considering launching a satellite with a large network to capture debris and return it to the planet, which Japan thinks is using a mobile tape.
In view of the fact that China has also proposed a solution to space debris, namely, a large-scale lighting device that makes space debris so vulnerable.
According to a paper published by a group of researchers from the University of the Chinese Air Force Engineering in the German month of Light Science, such a light device will be installed on a satellite to clean up the space sufficiently effectively, at least on the basis of the simulation results.
It is reported that the only way to prove effectiveness is to test and that there is no arrangements for such a mission, but perhaps early at night someone will install light equipment on the satellite and then send it to space.
Once it has been done, we can finally start the issue of the permanent elimination of space debris.

The right hand of Garcia says, "Dear Army, how are you?
Congratulations."
At 7 o'clock on the sixth night of the ESPN, the Lomaz Koch defeated Miguel Mariaga and secured his position.
In both of them, historian Egis Climas, of the Romance Section, noted that the potential for decision-making between the two voters depended on "perfect measurements".
"I used to be an easy level," says Garcia.
"I moved up the level to fight against Bronna (140 pounds), but my body was not so big.
Compared to 140 pounds, my body is about to recover.
I want to get back to the level.
And he has to get to the level of light, and then we can fight it.
That's what the cops want.
Then we'll meet them."
The Romance Section agrees.
"The ballistics need this war. "
Klimas asked him if he should pay for it, and his strategy was to allow the Lomé to compete with a 135 voter later this year in order to set a date for the next summer with Gasia (37-0.30 rounds). He was also interested in a small-scale competition with the Winners of the Forum on 23 September.

The latest results of the survey of the age assessment of Swedish refugees
Sweden ' s refugee testing was based on the latest method of medical evaluation of their age and the latest results showed that more than 80 per cent of the victims were judged to be over 18 years of age, but not all were convinced of their accuracy.
The Swedish National Medical Centre (R.ttsmedicalverket) launched this test earlier this year.
Following the lack of an accurate assessment of the age of the alleged minor refugees, the Swedish Immigrationverket designed these tests with a view to conducting a more accurate age assessment during the refugee process.
To date, the Swedish Immigration Agency has sent 6880 pilots, and the Law Medical Centre has now published the results of a total of 2481 pilots for the period from mid-March 2017 to 31 July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) were judged to be 18 years old or over, but in other 25 cases, the Swedish National Medical Centre also "probably 18 years old or over".
In 432 samples, the result is "probably under 18 years of age".
Only those who have doubts about age.
According to John Glanson of the Law Medical Centre, these findings are consistent with the results of the previous months.
He told The Local: "These data and the data of the previous months are not very different, and the figures are very consistent."
The highest percentage of cases where they were judged to be older than 18 did not necessarily indicate that these refugees were lying about their age.
In May, the Centre published 581 sample test results and said that there were 442 examples "showing that the testee was 18 years old or over".
The Svenska Dagbladet survey of 581 samples published this year found that 243 of them were publicly indicated by their 18-year-olds.
The X-ray examination of intelligence, the nuclear disks and the results of the analysis of dentists and radiologists have also been questioned in some areas.
One of the suspects was the interior scholar Claude Macus of the University of Carolina, whose work included assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they were early or late in their normal life.
He told the news paper Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I don't think the method of measuring should be used.
It's not fair to judge genetic age in this way.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can do it."
However, Glanson of the Law Medical Centre has the correct defense for these tests: " In general, it can be said that the uncertainty of a child ' s risk for adults is very small. "
The highest risk is that this person is under the age of 18, which is about 10 per cent.
The Governor of West Virginia announced the exchange of parties.
On Thursday evening, Jim Justice, President of the Democratic Party of West Virginia, announced at the meeting of President Tranup, that he would change the party.
"I like it, I don't like it, and the Democratic Party has left me," the judge said.
"Today, after I've done a lot of prayers and lots of thought, I'm going to tell you today that I'm going to tell you about the identity of the people of West Virginia that I can't help you with the status of the Democratic Party anymore."
The meeting sounded a welcome call.
"So, tomorrow, I will transform the party into a party," Justin added.
"As a teacher, I'm going to tell you it's time for another race to start."
There was an early commitment to make a significant statement at a meeting in West Virginia.
Mr. Tranup won 42 per cent of the vote in West Virginia, while Justin didn't support the Democratic Party candidate Hillary?
In 2016, Justin was assessed as the only billionaire in the state.
"Fobus" notes that he inherited his father's coal industry and owned coal mines in all five states.

"The Democratic Party currently has only 15 statesmen and controls the minimum number of national parliaments, and the statement made by the President of Jastys is the latest rejection of the political party that has lost its leadership from the above and cannot be found positive uniformed " . Rona, daughter of the National Committee of the Parties, said McDenil in a statement to the CBS press.

Sebastian Koto said that Russia apologized for the "integrity" of incitement.
On Thursday, the President of the International Trade Union, Sebastian Koko, expressed his appreciation for Russia ' s apology for the incitement of drugs and said that it was quite "true", but he reiterated that now it was not the time for Russia to resume its participation in the campaign.
At the International Trade Union Conference held before the World Trade Mark, the President of the Russian Federation, Mitri Hiraktin, indicated that his country was prohibited from participating in the campaign and he was determined to fight incitement.
He said he was sorry that "all the players who got money and money in the game were deprived of the prize."
Despite such comments, the International Conference on Lands still voted in favour of the maintenance of the ban. A previous report of the World Anti-Fraud Agency (WADA) referred to evidence of Russia ' s support for the use of anti-Frauds in November 2015.
"I believe that today's response is very sincere and very honest," the International Trade Union President Section told reporters.
"The Council and the General Assembly are pleased that the Russian Federation recognizes itself as a very busy time, and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can re-enter the race."
He's also "good" Russia has accepted the resurgence criteria.
"I think this is a very constructive day, and we believe we have made some progress, but the General Assembly supports the proposal of the Panel on the subject, which is not yet time for the restoration of the Russian flagship. "
" We need to make this situation normalized within the next few months.
Our guiding principle has always been the desire to separate the pure movement from the contaminated system," he added.
Nineteen Russians will participate in the World Trade Marks held on Friday, London, in accordance with the strict standards of the International Trade Union.
The Head of the International Trade Union Task Force, Simon Anderson, said that Russia had not yet met some criteria for the return of the race.

The U.S. Federal Reserve Officers generally considered tax change to be one of the factors in support of this appropriate step-by-step economic outlook. The United States Reserve predicted an economic growth of 2.5 per cent in 2018 and a three-fold increase.
Marketers noted that in the near future, European monetary policy is expected to increase the euro exchange rate rapidly, the United States dollar index continues to decline, and people's currency exchange rates are relatively rapid, but it is now seen that the European central market is not very quickly able to adjust its policy position, and that the short-term return to basic market fluctuations will ultimately result in the continued smooth operation of the foreign exchange rate as a major factor.

What effect does the financial rules of the football community have on Neymar (Neymar) transforming Paris?
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted expenditure by the European Union Football Club will not prevent Nepal from transferring its prices from the Barcelona Club, Spain, to the Paris Saint German Football Club (PSG), France.
As a result, the European Football Association (EEFA) has been further reduced to the Paris St. German Football Club. The European Football Association is an administrative body in the European Football Games and has the right to ban the participation of the teams in the European Football Union, which is widely concerned.
The "Financial Fair Competition Rules" (FFP) launched by the European Union in 2011 meant that the Paris St.
The Barcelona Club has paid €2.22 billion ($26.6 billion) only to pay the costs of the Brazilian football team, while the Nepali payroll tax is at a maximum of $1 million per year.
The following are some of the financial implications of Nepal ' s transfer to France.
In view of the funding of the team from the rich Qatari ruling family, of course, the Paris St. German Football Club could use the money-encouragement Nemal and include him in the army of other prominent stars.
Clubs can afford to buy a lot of money for gambling, but they must use legitimate income sources to compensate for the huge profits they have earned so that they can achieve balance in the related operations of football.
The "Financial Fair Competition Rules" was the idea presented by Michel Platini, who was elected President of the European Union in 2007.
This former French footballer believes that if banks or all of them withdraw their support funds, they are actually cheating on the risk of ruining the club for those clubs that are responsible for pursuing success.
In 2011, the focus of "rules" was to monitor the situation of losses in the club from the club ' s debt issue.
This change means that Roman Abramovich (Roman Abramovich) used a commercial model in 2003 to buy a potential club and then to improve the team and create a global card, now facing a more pressing situation.
During the three-year "rule" evaluation period as of 2018, the club may lose EUR 3 billion.
Despite the loss of the President in 2015, Aleksander Ceferin, a member of the European Union, remained committed to preventing excessive spending.
Andrea Traverso told the United States last week about the future rules and the "Eupposals" rules.
While the Paris St. German Football Club will pay a reasonable payment of the purchase clause for Sinemall, it can also be allocated within the contract period.
Since Nepal has signed a five-year agreement, the transfer of contributions in the next five-year annual accounts may indicate the cost of EUR 4440 million.
The first "rules" imposed in 2014 resulted in the most severe sanctions against the Paris St. German Football Club and the Manchester City Club under the Abuzabi flag.
The Paris St. German Football Club was sentenced to EUR 6,000,000 (at the same time the exchange rate was $82 million), then reduced to EUR 2000 million, and requested that the team be reduced to 21 players in the 2014-15 season, not normal 25 players.
The European Union is looking forward to the increase in income through association with the owner of the club, who deceives the club of the financial regulators.
While Qatar ' s companies can sponsor the Paris St. German Football Club, if the amount is considered to be above the standard market price, the European Union would not consider it legitimate income.
This is what happened in 2014 and the European Union decided at the time that the Qatar Tourism Agency had been able to support the Paris St. German Football Club.
It has been reported that part of the income of the Saint German Club in Paris may have been paid by the Qatar World Cup Commission in 2022.
However, it is easy to take such initiatives for the European Union's regulatory body for the purposes of the Paris St. German Football Club and the Group's Committee.
The recent sanctions against the Paris St. German Football Club meant that the European Union would be more likely to warn of any open rules.
It was said that the European Union had not had a preliminary discussion with the Paris St. German Football Club on the subject of Nepal ' s transfer.
The above-mentioned individuals contacted the United States because they were not authorized to discuss the situation of the Paris St. German Football Club.
An account published last year shows that the business income of the Paris St. German Football Club was €5.424 billion in 2015-16 and over €1 billion in profit.
The accounts of the previous financial year have not yet been published.
The Paris St. German Football Club is expected by the Federation of Nepal to contribute to the promotion of activities that allow business and the sale of clothing.
The club is expected to sign the Nemal camp income will increase by at least 30 per cent.
It is clear that when the greatest of them were absent, the Spanish Union was deeply angry and tried to prevent the movement of Nemal and claimed that the Paris St. German Football Club was in violation of "the rules".
The President of the Westminster Union, Javier? Tambas, told the Spanish newspaper AS, "This is a clear evidence of 'financial incentives', and the club and the state are the same," means Qatar, which has the ultimate ownership of the Paris St.
Arsene Wenger, a professor of the Arsene Wenger, held reservations about the attitude of the National Funding Club and the Westminster Union.
"This is the result of ownership, and this has completely changed the entire ecosystem of the last 15 years " , said Wung Quartet.
"When a country owns a club, anything like that will happen.
This would make compliance with "the rules" very difficult because for a country there are many different ways or interests that require great numbers of players to represent a country. "

As an art of culture, it is a model and representation of the eternal memories and manifestations of our era of facial expressions.
But as a series, it feels like it's not enough time.
"The first day of the camp" was a strong reaction, but it was not just because of its stupid silence (the horror was the original story of a fairy tale that was to be spoken by H. John Benjamin).
It's not possible to return to the past and become part of a joke.
In "After 10 years" adults are actually acting as adults, with little or no depth of emotion and even more dispersion, including the creation of an exciting film for the 90s, such as "promoting the hand of the mouse".

And there are a lot of musicians -- including Jenny Spartet, Nick O'Fman, Mahsalakhashbaz Ali and Colo Sevini -- who made a great music show.
But "exploration of two heroes" is so committed to making a really exciting advertising show -- there's a killer in the drama -- and it usually plays a role like that.

The Bank of England will maintain a rate of 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England will later declare that the interest rate will remain unchanged and that the previously weak economic growth and slow inflation have led to the prospect of destruction.
The Bank of England issued a warning because it had control over the interest rate at the same time as the increase in family income, and economic growth would continue to undermine "fashion".
The decision-makers of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain a rate of 0.25 per cent by 6-2 votes, while the minority members of this month called for an increase in interest rates, even if poor economic growth had reduced the incentives.
In its quarterly inflation reports, the Bank of England estimates growth in 2017 and 2018 by 1.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively, and warns that family income tensions will continue, while inflation will rise to nearly 3 per cent in the autumn.
In the next few years, however, it stated that there would be a need for a shift in interest rate to reduce the inflation brought out by Europe, while borrowing costs may need to be moved to a greater extent than expected in the financial market.
A year ago, a large number of economic promotion policies were implemented under the influence of Europe, and members decided to withdraw them.
The Bank of England will announce the suspension of the regular financing plan and will start providing valuable funding to the banks from February of the year, although it claims to be in line with that plan, it will now need to add additional 150 billion pounds on the basis of 1150 billion pounds.
In the record of the PPC, the Bank of England stated: " In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in recent times, as the actual income of the family will continue to pressure consumption. "
With regard to interest rates, the series reiterates the need for "certain monetary policy tensions" to push inflation and for "a higher level than market expectations".
The current market is expected to achieve the first growth in the third quarter of the year and the second one in 2020.
But it emphasizes that any move would be "slow" and "control".
The growth forecast for this year and the coming year has declined, while the forecast is 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent in May.

The British exchange rate for the United States has declined, and the euro has come to its end.
Britain dropped by 0.5 per cent, reached 1.31, dropped by 0.4 per cent, and reached 1.11 per cent.
Before a change in decision-making takes place, there are strong expectations that it will disappear due to recent unaccompanied growth data. The second quarter of GDP will increase to 0.3% and only 0.2% in the last three months.
The increase in the third quarter is likely to remain at 0.3 per cent, although it will increase slightly at the end of the year.
In general, families have been hit by an overwhelming shock, while pay increases are not sufficient, and the recent inflation report by the Bank of England has not brought them any good news, as it claims to be even worse before it changes,
It also claims that monetary policy can't prevent the fight against income over the next few years, but the wage is expected to recover "great" at the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, because of the enormous growth in demand for British commodities, the economy will be motivated and countered by the impact of low consumption.
The decision-making initiative had been developed a year earlier, with an alarming public in the EU as a result of the bombing of Britain, which was reduced to 0.25 per cent in August.
The Bank of England estimates that it may need four years to fully affect the price of goods and the British economy.
Prior to the publication of its latest rate of interest, the call to the interest rate was not heard, since the inflation order had already increased to normal family snow that had been repressed, while three decision makers called for a return to 0.5 per cent interest rate for 7 months.
Over the past month, inflation rose from 2.9 per cent in June to 2.6 per cent, although the Bank of England stated that it was expected to increase again over the next few months.

Coreco Mortgage Brokers, director of Korea, Andrew Montreck, said: "In view of the recent decline in interest rates, lending markets seem to become more competitive again, as creditors strongly call for more operations and look forward to the end of the year in positive terms.

The British National Medical Service System (NHS) has a large wave of controversial HIV drugs
After the collapse of the High Court on the provision of NHS drug financing, patients will be able to start accessing "changeable" HIV prevention treatment from September.
NHS England announced that an anti-explosive anti-drug (PREP), a drug that could be used before sexual conduct, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk groups by around 86 per cent.
It agreed to provide funding for the trial after the Supreme Court's decision last year, which stated that while NHS claimed that the local authorities should provide funding for such drugs, NHS had the right to pay the costs of PrEP.
The campaign announced on Thursday by Simon Stevens, Chief Executive Officer of the British NHS, has been called "a major new intervention", while the National AIDS Trust Fund (NAT) has its form as "key time".
In London, Brighton, Manchester, Livicupur and Sheffield, the sexual health clinic will become the first registered sexual health clinic. More clinics will be added in October and will then be fully implemented throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-explosive anti-drug (PREP) is a pre-sex drug used to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Experience shows that PrEP can significantly reduce the spread of HIV among people at risk.
Pre-sexual use means that there are sufficient specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
This drug can be used every day or two hours before sex.
Those qualified to be treated include homosexuals, bisexual men, transsexuals and HIV carriers who failed to receive treatment.
The Institute will determine whether the status of HIV infection is accepted by participants who agree to the test, including men, women, transsexual persons and those who are not aware of the treatment of antiretroviral drugs.
Individuals living in England and registered as a full-time medical doctor may also participate in the local sex health clinic.
The plan will cost $10,000, while the NHS England branch agency has signed a contract to purchase these drugs after international competitive procurement this week.
The test aims to assess the full potential of the PrEP by using a large sample to collect information on how to determine its position and how to absorb and apply the underlying evidence.
Mr. Stevens said: " This important new intervention should play a wide and increasingly successful complement and strengthening role in the prevention of HIV.
This is another step worth 30 years of action to address the major human health challenges. "
The British AIDS Trust Fund (NAT) Chief Executive Officer Jepola? Kim says: "This is a key time to combat AIDS.
If it is indeed aimed at the needs and groups at risk, it provides an opportunity to change the prevalence of AIDS in Britain prior to exposure.
From September onwards, the HIV-positive group will be funded through NHS through this experiment in England to obtain a new licensed tool, which is truly uniquely implemented without consultation with sex partners, which will improve the lives of many.
We are in favour of this announcement by both of us."
The Chief Executive Officer of the Higgins Trust Foundation, Ian, Greene, said: "The primary mission now is to ensure that tests are launched quickly within the country and that none of those infected with HIV can fall.
Now we've bought PrEP test drugs, and we've prepared to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk of HIV."
Mr. Saron, Minister of Public Health? Hochison said: "After a few months' delay and government delays, the initial work of the PreEP was welcomed and should come early.
Evidence shows how such drugs can bring about changes as part of our prevention of HIV and the prevention of the spread of such deadly diseases.
This will give us more insight into the advantages of PrEP.
Now, as soon as nationally possible, this experiment is being launched to protect individuals from HIV and to help us stop the spread of HIV in society further. "

High-quality life: using herb and herb design to build a house that is spacious
Joannie Ray was a banker who was very active in the entire building, and in 2014, she moved from the big house that was located in the corner of the castle to a small apartment in Bourne.
This apartment is located in a beautiful palace of Princess Annie, where Joanne doesn't pick up a chain to sell it, which is a powerful proof of the new design.
"Before this, my ex-boyfriend and I lived in a bigger house in the woods," Joannie said.
"I was looking for a suitable house at the price.
I saw this apartment in the Grand Duchy, and it's a very high ceiling.
I mean, it's about that day."
This 1,000 square meters apartment has been completed since the first watch of the room.
This apartment was originally a complex unit -- which needed to be moved through the kitchen to the bathroom -- and JoAnnie wanted to add storage space and buildings to make full use of the sky floor height.
"I want a high skyboard, a large window, enough light.
That's my request," she said.
To that end, she hired Elvan Azady from Duck&Shed's construction and design workshop (in Nodin) to use this 12.5-foot skyboard to build a house. This house is not only a development project but also a place where Joannie lives.
The height of the ceilings is insufficient to increase the two upper spaces, so the challenge of building is to create a high enough building for people to stand up.
Elvan needs to be creative so that he can solve this problem.
"The structure of the wall is quite complex," he explained.
"We have to set up space, put it down, and don't need to shake the back.
Not only is it easy to build a simple platform, but it is also necessary to launch these shells so that they can be at appropriate altitudes around the right side of the performance. "
By means of this arrangement, Elvan could have access to two fully-fledged rooms in the space -- which could add many interesting elements.
The building uses Retrouvius card recovery windows to attract tourists to the area of life.
The silver little furniture and Serge Mouille have been recognizable.
The use of the lens plays an important role in increasing the environment and space and light lines.
On both sides of the walkway, it can make it look bigger.
In the kitchen, with a cupboard, it's like a window into another room.
In the bathroom, a small box with chairs provides storage space for Johnny to store food and bottlers.
A beautiful hotel has an attractive sense of space that can be picked up when the kitchen is not used.
It's not new.
But the uniqueness of this broken kitchen is at the top of a car park.
"This is about knowledge in some areas of engineering," Elvan explained to the door of MDF's complex.
"This is used as a balanced principle, so when you move forward, it's easy to move."
As a result of the careful use of space and stocks, JoAnni received 16 square metres more than one bedroom and an improved desk.
"In the end, you sell it to the owner -- or say your property value is based on the owner's property," Elvan said.
" Basically, the landlord will go into the room and calculate the size of the building. "
They would try to increase the scope of space while using quality materials and thereby raise the feeling of the universe.
Elvan said, "The material is your own choice, so it can help create a sense of humor in the home."
"You won't love the power on the wall.
All these things are important, but they won't touch your heart."
In fact, it proves that by good design and by increasing additional coverage, standard accommodation can become a surprise to you.
Actually, you might be like Johnny, choosing to stay.

The two brothers were playing $5 billion in the real estate.
After their Italian family had set up their king 40 years later, two brothers were worth more than $5 billion, and one of the largest sovereign states in Victoria was fighting the Great War.
Colin De Lutis, former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer, lived in a famous house in Tucara district where three doors were his brother Paul's residence. The latter reported to the Supreme Court on the division of their real estate and business assets.
Since 2014, Paul has always wanted to leave the family business, but the two brothers have had a serious dispute over the division of assets in the Supreme Court.
The two brothers and their mother had 38 estates worth more than $5 billion, which were purchased by the family since 1973 at Smith Street, Corlinwood.
There, the family created Westco Jeans company and gradually developed it into 160 retail warehouses.
In 1999, the company was sold at a price of $85 million.
Thereafter, the money was invested in the property of the premises. At present, the family's assets group of De Harutis included the city offices, the plans for the development of lessenrick and Solento, the gold coast and the Blore Mountains, as well as the district shopping centre.
According to the agreement reached with his deceased father, his brother Paul was named "main promoters and ruling persons" of the Rutish family, with about two thirds of the company's assets, and about one third of Paul's.
A document submitted to the Tribunal stated that the value of the property of Colin was estimated to be $3.16 billion, while Paul ' s value of the property was $1.76 billion.
Paul believed that the distribution of real estate and cash proved to be the link between negotiations.
" The property distribution proposal made by Colin left me the best property I think is the best " , he wrote in a first court declaration in 2015.
On Friday, after several mediation failed, the Supreme Court held its hearings for the first time.
Now these two brothers are still struggling to gain control of the existing enterprise, which Paul said had taken Colin out of his office.
And Colin denied it and accused Paul of failing to manage certain estates.
In the early declaration submitted by Colin, he expressed his hope that the dispute would be resolved.
"My Italian tradition has decided that the family is the most important choice. My Italian blood unit is the most important family," he wrote.
The costs of the case continue to rise and there are several hundred pages of declarations, e-mails, as well as company reports from Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Carter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, as well as companies submitted by both parties to finance lawyers.
Ms. Dr. Rutis and her deceased husband, Luigi, have been immigrants to Italy since the end of the 20th century, and they have been operating a large-scale restaurant and restaurant, and in the early 1970s, they have purchased a store in Brussels.
They bought some supplies from the Corinwood industry, where Colin opened the family's first cow shop.
Colin said, "I read three times," and he created Westco there, "and Paul was still very young (about 10 years old). "
Anna, De Rutis, said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer property and land to their son.
"Louiji always told me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court at last," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, were no longer members of the D?R., and Colin said that when Mark left, he paid $1 million to him and $26 million to Luke.
Paul said that Luke and Mark were "not satisfied with their property distribution articles".
According to the post published by Eddie McGuire from 2015 on television, Colin was a member of the former AFL Club, but he has remained a low-level member.
" Fairfax Media " contacted Colin and Paul on Friday and their lawyers.
But only Colin answered by letter. He said that the case had been submitted to the court "I can't really say too much."
"My brother Paul chose to prosecute me and bring our family affairs to court, which is very, very difficult," he wrote.
In 2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
He said: " Our father doesn't want to see such a dispute with Paul and me happen at the end " and adds, " he still hopes for a solution to the dispute. "
Friday, this hope seems ruined.
"Our problems will be resolved by the Court in the near future," wrote Colin.

In August last year, the British Central Bank decided to reduce its interest rate to less than two-fifths of its historical base.
It would harm the interests of the middle-income class and would benefit large enterprises and rich people and would therefore be severely attacked by the Democratic Party at the stage of the discussion.

The media time of the President of the new President of the Tranquo
Others have tried, but failed.
John F. Kelly might be able to do it.
If that's true, he's the first one.
According to the U.S. political news website Politico, the new White Screen Leader Plan restricts the flow of information to President Tranpu — including the media report — with a view to ensuring greater stability for the boss.
The following is a paragraph by the journalist Josh Dossie:
"When John F. Kelly, the new president of the White screen, began his first day of discussion with senior officials, he noted that he was going to address a major issue of President Tranup's entry into the White House: bad information in the President's hands."
Kelly told these officials that receiving good information would help the President to make a better decision, so information would be required by his hand — either in writing or in summary form.
Kelly's diagnosis seems to be similar, but others have also tried to cover it through the time of monitoring Tranup's media, but eventually failed.
President Tranup's TV show has been coming for a long time — now in the White House, and he's still looking at the TV habit.
In February, ex-competitor Sam Naberg told Politico: "If the candidate is disappointed by the unfair report of the candidate Tranquo, then let him know that he has also received the correct report on the basis of his belief.
Tara Parmeri, of Politico, wrote at the time: " According to the experience of six previous contestants, control of the habit of spreading Tranquo Twitt has always included certain praise in the media information that he received by himself. "
It's okay.
But Tranup's habit of coercion has been "indicted" in fact ridiculous.
Maybe these competition officials know something we don't know about -- that if they don't have their intervention, Tranup's move would even get more hotter.
We may never know about those twats that Tramp didn't send.
If his staff can save him from the fire, even if only a few times, their efforts are worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Taran from causing the dispute.
Part of the problem is that in a white box composed of competing groups, people are promulgating their world views by sending reliable and unreliable information to Tranun.
Politico — all about this story — was well reported by the consultants in May on the provision of suspicious information to the President in a strategic manner.
This is an example described by journalist Shen Gudman:
" The current representative and former Tranun-Pun official said that the reaction of Tranunu to negative media elements such as firelights, in particular those with devastating information, would be insane to find its source.
At the end of February, a copy of an article on GotNews.com's website by the web promoter Charles C. Johnson was posted to the President, who accused Vice-President Katie Walsh of being a source of great information for the White House," when Taranup was such an expression.
Even though John had been imprisoned permanently for his torture, no specific evidence had been provided, and he had been excommunicated by a large number of misgivings and subsequently openly denied.
Tranun looked at the article and began to ask officials about Walsh. "
Gudmanja also said that at the time, Prime Minister Reins Pribas and White Secretary Rob Bot " had tried to establish a system to manage and record documents received by Tranunpur."
What's the result?
Kelly's gonna do the same thing, three months later.
He may be able to prove himself to be a more efficient manager of Bipribás, but Tranpu or Tranpu of the movement, while his assistants are still competing and fighting for power.
These permanent effects will make it difficult for Kelly to carry out her mission.

Italy ' s strong attitude towards the rescue of migrant ships by non-governmental organizations
Italy's non-governmental organizations operating in the Mediterranean are being warned that if they do not sign new operating rules, they will have to continue to implement rescue.
When the Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti, received a " press release " interview, he said: " If non-governmental organizations do not sign new norms of conduct, it is difficult to see what they will think they will be following. "
The day before the warning was issued in Mainiti, the Italian authorities had actually seized the trafficking of persons by the German Aid Organization on board a ship that had been suspected of "young rescue" and had helped illegal migrants to arrest them.
The assistance organization operates only one year and refuses to comment on the specific allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
In a social media statement, the organization stated that "for us, salvation is now, and will be the most important thing in the future, so we are very sorry that we cannot now operate in the area of rescue. "
" After all the information has been collected, we can now only assess all allegations and situations. "
Since October, Italian officials have been monitoring the ship Iuventa, organized by the Youth Rescue Organization.
Its shipowners are concerned about the fact that the trafficking in persons is carried directly by small ships and allow the smugglers to run away and re-use ships.
According to the prosecutor ' s record, at least one such meeting was reported to occur on the seabed of the Libyan coast 1.3 miles [1.3 km]. It was published by the Italian media.
Its crew were suspicious of the clear lack of respect for the powers of the Italian Coast Guard, which resulted from humanitarian warmth and not any other motive for monitoring rescue operations in the region.
In accordance with the rules of conduct, Iuventa was apparently required by an Italian police officer to monitor their activities on board.
Currently, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in rescue operations have agreed to comply with the norms of conduct, namely, the Children ' s Relief Council, the headquarters at the Mal his immigration aid station and the Pro-Activa Open Arms of Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that they felt that the new provision was not necessary, but could be accepted, since these provisions would not bring any "significant change and obstacles" to their rescue operations.
A non-national doctor (MSF) was awarded Nobel Prize in the organization that refused to sign.
At the same time, the number of migrants arriving in Italy has declined in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libya ' s coastal defence and joint local mayors have been effective.
The minister said, "In recent days, we began to see light on the streets. "
He announced a plan for a deep discussion this month: dealing with economic development activities with the Libyan mayors, Chad, Niger and Mali, how to reduce the number of immigrants who want to leave these countries to Europe.
The main economic operator of the Transport Bank stated that, due to the trend toward the end of the period before 2017, industrial value increases are expected to increase to 6.6 per cent.
The growth in fixed assets is expected in December to be 7.2 per cent, compared with the previous month and below last year.
Although industrial production would be weak in October, it was essentially equal to November.
Our country's manufacturing investment was under operation in December, but the base investment had little improvement, so it was expected that fixed assets would be held at the same time as November.

In 2014, Roy was found dead in a car with carbon dioxide; this year, he was 17 years old.
The letter of Carter showed that she was concerned about his suicide.
"In a few letters sent to him two weeks before his death, he was lying with his family.
At the time before he killed himself, she wrote, "You need to do this, Conrad," "what you want to do is start the generator and then get freedom and happiness."
Judge Monize said that Mr. Roy's death was a matter of concern and ordered her not to benefit from any media in the case.
There are legal differences in this case.
She was accused of killing her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and declared innocent two years later.
30-year-old Ms. Nox, quoted in a special issue published in " The Los Angeles Times " as saying: " Michel? Carter is worthy of compassion and help, not imprisonment. "
Artists were appointed as a controversial film artist, and since he began to film the first film "red-red" and he has received a lot of inconsistencies while he has been leading Chinese film competitions.
On 2 February, the journalist was informed by the Lassa Netball Club that, recently, Rassa's young men had received the fourth name of the National Youth Ball Game Union, held in Beijing.
The LASA youth team is composed of 11 members of the TSO, who are trained by the clergy as the assistant team assistant to LASA.
Before going to Beijing to the general contest, the "boy of the ball."
The director-in-chief of the Lassa Nett Soccer Club said that the success of the team had improved compared to last year, and the confidence of the members of the team and their commitment to the race were clearly increased. The exchange of athletes and other teams was also more comprehensive and, on the ground, more and easier.
At the end of the match, the Chief of Commands stated that he wished to work hard for the hidden gambling business through the experience of participating in the contest.
It is understood that in Beijing's competition, footballers were overcome by factors such as low oxygen and showed images of the constellation.
Despite the fact that the O'O'S is a gold mine, the miners have to be under the sky, but the name of the field will be in the wind.
The car manufacturer is in shock, and Ody's gonna change it to 850,000 oil cars.
On the previous day, Ody announced that she would provide more than 350,000 vehicles with software upgrades.
The Prime Minister of Bamamas said that the Bamaja believes "that there are more intelligent choices than no limits," meaning that European cities - including the headquarters of Bamajam in Kamani - consider banning or restricting oil vehicles.
It announced on Tuesday that 300 million Mesades vehicles in Europe would be refurbished to reduce their oil emissions.
No company declared this to be a call back.
European car manufacturers in Europe and the United States have worked hard to promote the use of diesel vehicles to help achieve carbon dioxide emissions.
However, carbon dioxide emissions are considered to be causing carbon dioxide and may lead to carbon dioxide.
The cost of the installation of the vehicle to offset the emission of end-of-vehicle gas is also increasing, so it is difficult to maintain the competitiveness of the fuel vehicle at prices.
As Germany's car manufacturer faced a review, the government led by Prime Minister Angela Marker was also accused of overhauling these powerful car companies and ignored the signs of the problem.
These vehicles are trying to avoid heavy public coverage, that is, concealing their use of the so-called defective devices, adjusting the emissions in accordance with the rules of the vehicle test and restoring normal under normal conditions.
Many senior officials were accused in the United States and other senior officials were being investigated by the two coastal States of the Atlantic.
Last month, Ody was arrested by the Heat Education Officer before the Department of Motor Development in Germany.
The former Director, Zachero Giovanni Pami, was an Italian citizen and could therefore be tried in the United States without extradite protection.
Earlier this year, Ody was involved in a criminal investigation involving the general public in Germany, and the Government of Germany alleged that Ody's system had been expanded only to the United States' scope of investigation.
Ody's investigation may have a significant impact on the public: the Hhowwa car manufacturer is a percentage of the profits that are less than the share of the vehicle.
One film was prepared to show up, from two to several years old, but the so-called diaspora was popular.
The film "The Great Sea" will be released on July 8th, 12 years from the preparation of the film!
"The Great Lakes" by the original authors, 21-year-olds from the University of Chicago, created a business of hot-winning, and a good friendly day with each other. In 2008, they received a million-dollar risk investment from the United States of America, and started the film industry's women "The Great Lakes".
The video has received many prizes from outside the country at the creative stage and has been collected by the French Modern Art Centre Pedua and praised as "one of the most outstanding arts".
For six years from creation to the production of history, it has been known as "the goddess of gods" by millions of first - century poets.
"The Great Sea" tells an amazing story that belongs to Chinese people, which brings new hopes to all the public as a result of the publication of this archive of warnings.
"It's only been doing this for 12 years, now it's become a reality, and I'm both nervous and excited."
He said: "The old man wants to use one of the fifty budgets of others to make the same graphic effect as everyone else, and the team is going to be mad at me."
This "world factory" which has been dependent on a number of workers and large-scale workers, is focusing its attention on high-level people who can lead this city to reposition.
The high-level activities of the Government of the Near East City are held on weekends, and the first financial reporters see that some powerful local companies are participating in the talks.
On the red background, they marked the wrong price on the top of the red wall on a very bright piece of advertising.
Thus, China's Telecommunication Industrial Association decided to develop the United Nations Telecommunication Industry and sign the Convention on Self-Delegation.
The Provence tree is threatened by climate change.
Clothing has become a symbol of the southern French city of Prunce, but there is now bad news that it is being threatened by climate change.
The continued drought and the presence of germs containing viruses has led to a decline in clothing that has left scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Institute for Agricultural Research (CRIEPPAM), in Provence, said: "The wood-dressing of Ponance is facing a serious threat because the plant has been affected in recent years by climate change, and the rains are greatly reduced and the rains are raining.
It'll affect the life cycle of the clothes.
There is also a smaller body, one that can spread microorganisms, and in very harsh weather, they will appear. "
The key is its large number.
In addition to attracting vacationers, clean clothes were also used in the oil and mineral industries.
Eric? José says: "In contrast to the many large flowers that can be cultivated, there are many long-dwelling plants, we have a smaller body, a poor development, a lack of or a weak one.
So our oxygen content is less."
The solutions under consideration include better irrigation technologies and mitigation of landfills, protective mixtures of soil and water to be planted on the soil and development of more dryer species.
In contrast to the scientific elements in the film, the two main actors showed that they were more attractive than the stories in the video.
On the afternoon of 5 September, the city reporters in Washington, D.C., continued to meet with famous people from many communities and two other voice artists, who were surprised that they were almost silent.
One of them is Berlin. One of them is a senior youth actor, and the first was the "mental crime" of Juan and Levi.
The danger of Mexico is serious. The press has been killed.
All members of the Riodoce newspaper usually meet on Wednesday to recall their reporting plans for the riots in the state of Rio de Janeiro, which are caused by criminal organizations, corruption officials and endless drug wars.
But today, tragic films are covering themselves, and they gather together to discuss security issues.
They were told to change their daily routine, which was important.
Two deep-rooted journalists discussed how much safer people are: they should take their children to the office (the office had been attacked in 2009) or leave them at home.
The security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemies, neutrals and allies.
These journalists were given names under each column — without evidence, observation and directness.
There are doubts about drug trafficking, politicians, businessmen and journalists, or cartels on the list of governments, which has made the news of Mexico very dangerous.
Violence has not stopped, and there are more and more journalists throughout the country: according to the report of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been killed since President Enrique Benieja's death in December 2012; 589 journalists have been protected by the federal protection following attacks and threats; and at least 7 journalists have been killed in 7 states this year.
The last one died was their editor and source of inspiration, while the co-founder of "Riodoce" was Javier Valdiz Kadenas.
Valdiz has written a lot of books on drug violence, and he writes in one of them: "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist. "
Everyone could feel deeply that he had left, although he was not there — a large photo attached to the front of the "Riodoce" office, Valdiz pointed to the word "justice"; and these two 30-year-old journalists, Alan Ivara and Miriam Ramirez, also showed his smile on the T-shirt, with eyes or his distinctive Panama hat.
The seminar did not take place until two months after his death; journalists were discussing their common wounds, dreams, loss of sleep and misgivings.
Although a special federal prosecutor ' s office was established in 2010, only two persons were prosecuted in accordance with the record of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of crimes committed each year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so it is unlikely that the killers will be brought to justice.
In Riodace, they kept reporting about the violence in the state of San Antonio, although they had already broken their hearts, although the land had been devastated by thousands of earthquakes.
Ivara said that there was no killer information, no justice, so there was no great value in holding a security seminar.
He said, "It's stupid to take part in such a seminar.
As long as we don't know why, you don't believe anyone."
On May 15th, Valdiz left the office of "Riodoce" in the capital of Cucuria.
Only two men were arrested in several street areas, and they forced him out of the car and fired 12 guns, which were assumed to be because of the name of the newspaper — the translation of "Twenty River".
The bastards drove his car away and destroyed it nearby.
Valdiz is 50 years old.
Stay with his wife and two grown children.
Kyria Cana's four.
But about Waldiz, there's really nothing but silence.
Since the last year of Guzman's arrest and extradition to the United States in January, the state of Znaniro has become the most bloodiest place in the country, and the killers of hostile forces are insane.
One or more people were shot every day on the streets of Zionaro, and two graveyards in the grave were filled with toxic waste.
The state of "silence" is temporarily forgotten when only one cartel controls this coastal state and its ports and traffic routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdiz was well aware of the dangers of this work, 60-year-old "Riodoce" co-founder and director Ismer Poonche was no longer shocked by the lack of protection from his friend.
He believed that two mistakes caused this tragedy.
The first, 2 months were published by Damasso Lopez, who led a group of cartels fighting several of Guzman's sons.
The report may provoke the anger of these boys, and when the paper was sent to the report, suspect group members bought it.
The second mistake was that Valdiz had not forced him to leave Mexico for his own safety after the other newspaper had been confiscated with the same story.
Valdiz was a fugitive from Mexico and abroad, and his death meant much to Mexico ' s violence against journalists.
His spirit survives, his friends and colleagues believe he's been with us.
In 2003, he was also a deep-rooted journalist of Noroeste, who, in combination with five colleagues, created Riodoce, sold 50 dollars.
He said that in Zhenoro, "There is no way to deal with drug problems in the media. "
With the passing of time, the report has won a good reputation because of the great truth and increased consumption and advertising.
Newspapers like to be able to report directly and without fear of being subjected to review, and readers like to publish stories that are not being reported by others.
"Riodoce" was awarded five years after the creation of Maria Moscapo, a country in the United States of America.
The International Press Freedom Award for Vardiz was awarded by the Association for the Protection of Journalists of the same year, which showed his courage to pursue the most real drug report in Mexico.
He said he was scared too.
He said, "I want to keep living. "
Later in October, in a local television interview at Rompevinto TV, he said, "In the state of San Antonio, drug trafficking is a way of life,
You have to carry on your mission as a journalist -- either that's it or that's it.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many deaths... why don't you say something about what's going on?"
"Riodoce"'s entire staff misses Valdiz, and he doesn't feel like an ordinary worker, misses a friend who doesn't care about the recommendations, and forgets how this teacher knows how to live.
They depend on his custom.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar in front of the office is always sitting on the same table.
Now they will ask: "Did the custom of his day cause him to fall into ruin?"
His death also made them have to think about how to work well and live well.
"They don't like your problems with their women and children, nor do you like your influence on their legitimate company and the secret airport used for drug trafficking.
They all crossed their backline."
The result is that, even when it is safest, high self-review and self-defence are required.
Believe in your own ideas.
If you're in danger, get out of here.
"Riodoce," editor Andreis Viral, says, "the problem is that it's a feeling of being deceived... and then it's going to happen like Haveer."
He and others said that the previous rules were no longer applicable to the state of San Marino — such as those no longer applicable to the state of Tamoripas, the state of Veracruz, the state of Grero and other states, as well as to the private streets of these states, and the situation of the institutions, the corruption of government officials, the smoke.
The situation is constantly changing.
In the room where the Riodoce staff participates in security training, it is suddenly not allowed to use the phone; it is said that just days ago, interstellar software sold to the Government in Mexico has been used to monitor journalists and activists.
In addition, two police officers flew under the tree and avoided 104 degrees (40 degrees Fahrenheit).
They are the government's offices to protect Riodace, which are located in a four-story building in the middle of the Kuri Canon street area.
Some journalists joked that they didn't know that the police would not belong to the 50 per cent confidence that the governor himself had said.
Newspapers have gone to the mountain areas for several months, where drug trafficking groups are under actual control.
"Riodoce" reported three major events this week.
One of them was killed by the brother of Hurio Sesal Chavez, who had been shot by an ex-combatant in the state of Zhenoro.
The government's funds are also disclosed in the governor's household.
As well as the kidnappings in a large dining room in Kurya, this restaurant's office is only one street area.
Officials have not published information on the kidnappings and the kidnapping process, so they need to be careful when writing what they know about this city: that is where drug trafficking and official love.
A journalist from the public archives learned about the restaurant's registration under the name of a politician of the political party's political revolution (PRI), which occupied almost all political divisions throughout the last century.
In recent years, several State party rulers of the Revolutionary System have been exposed to corruption in several cases of serious concern.
Viralil asked the journalist to write an incident at the scene, including an incident involving a son of a Mexican leader, Guzman, who escaped military attacks.
If it was a few months ago, readers would look at the Waldiz map and find the most powerful information on this kidnapping incident.
46-year-old Viral, because of his body's appearance, was called "smooth," he said, "we've already known what happened.
All of our sources of information are now broken.
Valdiz's office is now being used to store the marks and posters of the protesters, as employees are becoming what they would never want to become: activists on behalf of the media.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez took a mark out of the room with his hand and went to the local prosecutor's office to attend a visit related to another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared three days after the murder of Valdiz, in the western part of Michigan.
Officials found a body that was burned and claimed to have been tested according to DNA, that's his body.
At the national level, journalists are becoming more and more inflexible, and they are organizing protests, using the words "saving the media" on human roads and buildings.
On that day, the Chief of Staff was not in Washington, D.C., and he was trying to promote justice in the case of Valdiz and to seek international support.
On the second day that Valdiz was killed, Ramirez accused the officials of kidnapping journalists during a meeting with the governor of Zhannaro, and because they told the truth to kill them.
Since her anger had affected her objectivity, she also requested her resignation from the position of reporting government affairs.
Valdiz has repeatedly reaffirmed that Mexican journalists are organized crime and are surrounded by corrupt government officials and a society that is not interested in the desert.
In his last book "Drug News" he wrote that not only were the victims of drug trafficking but also on the list of politicians and security forces involved in organized crime and corruption.
The Media Monitoring Group, Article 19, will be attacked by over half of the journalists last year by police and public officials.
Ramirez said, "In Mexico, they're letting you die to keep you silent."
Obviously, these killings are unheard of.
No one has forgotten six years ago that President Maria Elizabeth Massius died at the border of northern Tamoripas.
Her body had a word called "I came for my report."
Her hair was cut off and put on a computer key and an ear.
After Miroslava Brachi was killed in March, some press elections were closed, such as El Norte, on the northern border of Chihuahua.
Others are still on their way, but they are still on their way to El Manana of Nuevo Laredo.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez used an article to open up a drug dialogue with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their homes or have even left this country.
It's a difficult option.
It's hard to find a job in flight, and they still need to be careful on the streets and alert to danger.
Sometimes they will be arrested and reportedly killed together with four women in a city in Mexico City three months after the flight from Velacross in 2015.
This is the usual stage of high-risk decision-making for those who remain behind the screen.
Ivara wanted to be a witch, and he recognized that drug trafficking made him afraid.
He said, "Mexico is becoming a hell, so I became a journalist."
Last Friday night, the latest newspaper had been printed, "Riodoce" editors sitting on the streets outside the office, and suddenly their phone rang.
A series of armed armed forces near the city of Masatran have been identified as 19 dead by the enemy forces and security forces.
The war was also under way, as a series of cartel information had been discovered in the region.
They're on Riodoce's website via the phone on the street.
The next day's head has to be changed.
The police are coming up nearby, and there's another gun fighting in the area.
There's a police officer standing there waiting to see if they're alert.
If they had something to fear, they wouldn't show up.
The author of the newspaper had died and pointed out in his big picture where all of Riodoce's staff were expected to follow his steps.
"How could you even want to close it on the same day that Haveer was killed and the trainer asked me to send her to the street to report?"
China's 2020 market size or breakdown of millions of dollars from the journey of cars
[A summary] In the context of increased consumption and free movement, the country has been encouraged by national policies and the growing love of consumers.
At the same time, however, the self-sustainment market, which is expected to destroy billions of dollars, is also facing two challenges.
In a large context of increased consumption and free movement, tourism has been encouraged by national policies as well as increased consumer love.
At the same time, however, there are two challenges for the self-sustainment of millions of tourists, one in which the development and market needs of the tourism industry are unfair, and one in which tourism clubs and tourism companies are faced with very low difficulties; the infrastructure and services faced by the tourism industry are also at an early stage.
As a total of 60 per cent of domestic tourism, market sizes are expected to destroy billions.
In 2016, 44 million people were visited throughout the country, about 60 per cent of the total number of total domestic tourism, and by 2020 the size of the railway market was expected to break down by one million.
According to the statistics of the Chinese Railway Association on the number of drivers from motor vehicles, there has been a steady increase in the number of passengers from five years to more than half.
At the same time, more attention and support have been expressed in regions and at the national level in this emerging area of self-sustainment, and the policy framework for self-sustainment, travel and leisure travel has been set up between 2016 and 2017.
In July 2017, the National Tourism Agency, eight sectors such as the National Sports Directorate-General, published "Development Plan for the Development of Vehicles in the Field of Motorcycles "; in the same month, UNMOVIC, 14 sectors such as the Ministry of Finance, "Promoting Rural Tourism Development Upgrading Action Programme (2017)" focused on rural tourism.
Policy exhibitions provided opportunities and policy guidance for domestic tourism development.
It's a big deal. It's a key to the whole industry.
While the potential of the domestic self-trafficking markets is enormous, national policies are actively guiding, but the self-sustainment industry remains at the primary stage.
According to "The 2016-2017 Annual Development Report of China, China has shown that there are thousands of people in the domestic sports club, car club and car club, but that the percentage of the self-sustainment by tourists is mostly based on their travel arrangements, and that there are only about 15 per cent of those who are in different types of institutions such as the sports club.
At the same time, self-sustained tourism companies and traditional tourism companies are also indicative of the availability of self-sustainment products that are sold only by some suppliers on the online tourism platform, and some self-sustainment clubs are important suppliers.
As part of the organization's tourism activities, it covers "food, housing, rent, renting, buying, shopping" in many ways, high levels of breakdown, high flow supply chains and high organic consumption of tourists.
The founder and CEO of the Bicycle Club of Beijing on Sundays and CEO is considered to be the same in nature and the travel company of the Bicycle Club. The early main lead model is under-line activities, and the core is from tour-line products and team services.
Now, however, the quality of street products in the area of tourism is very high, and the level of mission services varies, and the need for re-transforming services is met by the Ministry of Tourism.
It can be seen that self-sustainment is not an independent industry itself, but it has created a cross-regional environment, an ecological circle of the industry, and a perfect industrial chain.
The experts noted that in addition to basic tourism consumption, testing was a more important component of consumption.
Therefore, the development of self-industrial development should be enhanced, the development of self-sustainment+ theme and the IP of self-sustainment products.
It's not just the road. It's not just the parking lot.
In the face of self-resurrection, the basic components of the journey are also more primitive.
Leighe noted that the tourism environment is not only a road but also an internal integration of transport with tourism elements, but that the road and tourism sector itself are responsible for increasing the tourism element, also staying in building premises, advisory centres, advertising centres, and the combination of tourism is still not high.
Building experience is worth taking into account the "66 U.S. road" of the famous self-trafficking road.
The design of the spectrum is no longer the fastest route between the destinations, but it is based on the design concept of "tested car interests", which provides the best enjoyment of the road map for self-trafficking visitors; the perspectives can point to the connection of the tourist perspectives, preserve the historical value and cultural value of the coastal ecological resources, and provide a variety of thematic activities to enhance the participation and tourism experience of visitors and create economic benefits for the local tourism industry.
In addition to the views of the camp, the camp is an important fitting facility for self-governing.
But few of the self-sustainment tourists known by the New York Times choose consumers who live in the camp.
They believe that many camps are preferable to infrastructure, only to meet the needs of food, archives, products alone and many elements.
There was a lack of openness among businessmen who said that many of the enterprises that had been camped years ago had been unable to follow up on the infrastructure and services of the post-collapse system; many of the operating conditions were deteriorating and there were no late-term financial inputs, and it was difficult to make some corresponding packaging products.
Consumer groups
According to data published by the Chinese Railways Association in 2017, since the age at which the group has concentrated from 21 to 40 years of age, in particular 31 to 40 years of age, this group has a certain economic base and a higher demand for personalized tourism and more for child tourists.
According to the housing survey, the population of tourists prefers non-standard accommodation.
From a self-sustainment type, around it is the main type of self-sustainment, which is 84.32 per cent.
It's a lot of people's way of leaving, but it's smaller than that.
At the same time as consumer demand increases, visitors from the "Visual Point of View" in the past began to change their views, not "car pictures," but rather more attention to the test and process of travel.
Terroron uses fake clothes to avoid enemies.
Look, it's terrible, but it looks like a beautiful picture.
Researchers have published the first study of how many canals have been discovered and how they have been found to be of immense size, and how they have been preserved, and therefore experts have called it "Monalysa of the Terroronian border".
This respectable stone has been preserved very well and can even determine the color of its skin as red. This means it has some "hard experiences".
A related report in the journal " Contemporary Biology " describes it as " the most perfect conservation of mammals found in history, as well as one of the best specimens of terrorism in the world " . "
The diamond is a new species of fungi found in the middle of the White Age of 1.1 billion to 1.12 billion years ago.
Its storage condition is very perfect and surprised by the researchers who describe it as "very exciting to look forward to".
According to the National Geological Journal, this type of landmine has been the most perfect conservation of the same type since history.
On 21 March 2011, Shawn Funk found this concrete stone when it was mined at the Sungor Million Mine mine near the north of McMurburg, U.S.A., Canada.
At the time, he was confronted with something that didn't look like a rock around him, so he decided to take a closer look.
After that, he discovered that he was sent to the Royal Canal of Terrculgo biobiology.
The 6-year period when the study personnel were lost revealed the real sight of this wild animal hidden inside the soil of 2500 pounds (1100 kg).
With such hard work, the final results can now be published.
"If you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping," King Taylor's biologist, first author, Caleb Brown, said.
"It will become one of the most beautiful in scientific history and preserve one of the best models of terror -- Mona Lisa in the terror zone."
By studying its skin, researchers have discovered that although it is toxic, it is like walking tanks, but it is likely to be threatened by a major threat from the meat trolley.
It is used by many modern animals as a means of avoiding the use of such heavy-boiling terrors to avoid predators and to adopt what is called "anti-smokers".
The expert said that it could be better integrated with the environment in this way and thus avoid the enemy, indicating that it was seized by a larger terrorist.
This 1.1 billion-year-old-old animal belongs to one of the finals of the Rhonese family, which was the first newspaper to be released in May and is currently being shown at the Royal Museum of Biologicals in Teresergu.
Mark Mitchell, one of the team's team members, spent 7,000 hours carefully studying the face of the giant and calling it "Boreelopelta markmitchelli".
The model was well preserved so that Dr. Michel, as well as the international scientific team, could record the drawings and shape of the bees and bees.
They found the anti-graffiti, a common way of protecting the animal environment, which means that the back of the animal is darker than its face.
Although the anti-cancer technique is common, the results are surprising because the body of such a virus is far more than the existing animal that uses anti-cancer techniques.
Such a terrorist is facing pressure from the killing of meatthirsty terrorists, thus moving towards a positive direction and enabling them to hide in the pit as a means of survival.
However, most of the existing animals, such as rats, horses or other animals, are as small and vulnerable as animals, which demonstrate that the animal is facing real life pressure.
"The great catch of fatty livers shows how dangerous the white blood cells are," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their shells likewise shows that the hormonal skin color is red.
Scientists are continuing to study the lifeline of the animal, including its preserved nutrients, in order to find food that is finally available.
They believe that when he died, he sank into the river and was then thrown into the Great Sea and finally drowned in the bottom of the sea.
At that time, the climate in the province of Aberta was as warm as the climate in southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans may now be deeper into the land.
Brown said: "It's really amazing that this seal has been kept completely covered, and so far it has been preserved in space so that its original form can be preserved. "
"Therefore, the shape of that organism is almost the same as that of the White Age.
You don't need too much imagination to rebuild it; if you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping."
The White Age was a time when large-scale foot-and-mouthed horrors were on the surface of the earth.
Despite being the king of terror, it appeared only after millions of years of terror.
They include high-density, a 6-tonnes, 38 metres long (11.5 meters).
The latest research has found that scientists who now believe in the journal "modern Biology" believe that after the end of the cycle, it was thrown into the sea and then formed a tree in the soil.
On 21 March 2011, Hong Kong was buried in the habitat near McMerburg, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-manufactured hormone, and it's perfect for skin and tissue in areas from the nose to the bone.
This biomedium is about 18 metres (5 metres), with a height of 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
It's got two 20-inch angles, rising from the edge.
The researchers believe that this landmine virus is now active in the western regions of Canada and then flooded into the sea by flooding.
However, such a graveyard allows its remains to be preserved completely.
Such a special sample of fossil remains perfectly preserved and remains the remains of the remains of the remains cover an uneven membrane on the skull of the thoracic head.
As Michael Greshko wrote in "national geology" magazine, this level of storage is as beautiful as in the middle of the day.
I think it's hard to believe.
The remains of the skin ammonia are still covered on the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of
Its right front is on its side, five feet up.
I can get his ammo statistics out."
Newspapers learned that the addition of natural or plant-based marine oxygen classes, corpus acids and acidic acid supplements to the production of fossil fuels could have a positive effect on traditional acids, formed by hydrochloric acids, carbon dioxides, and increased by 5 × 10 percentage points of common carbon dioxide use.
Environmentally friendly, the potential for crop growth is clear, especially the quality of BB.
The total number of security personnel is more than twice the number of security personnel in London City in 2012.
To ensure the security of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil will launch the largest security coalition plan in history.
In the past, the Government of Brazil indicated that there would be a total of 850,000 military and police personnel working side by side, including 20,000 military personnel and 650,000 police officers.
Most soldiers will be responsible for the protection of Oo transport station, while the new 3,000 soldiers will be responsible for international airports, railway stations and street security.
The police are patrolling other parts of the city, including the streets, the public and the streets.
It has been reported that 6,000 soldiers have now arrived in Rio to serve as security services for Ombudsman.
They are also responsible for patrolling the main roads of airports and airports and Ooports in addition to the four major areas of Rio de Janeiro.
The introduction of an evaluation mechanism in the service sector was not a new thing, and it was important that the evaluation mechanism should be effective and that it should be more effective and non-transparent.
How do terrorists learn the answer to this question: "Who's way?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Farrell was shocked.
On the first day of his visit to New York City, this Saint Louis sat on his favorite bed and watched his face on the phone.
She sometimes found a high-end cat.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and the child was lying on the street."
She found no one else to publish this information on the e-mail, and she was very confused.
A @TheePharoah user keeps sending her a motion message.
Michael Brown was an 18-year-old black man who had no weapons and was killed by a white police officer in Florence, Missouri.
He posted a picture of a bronchial missing body on the street and his body hung on the street for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrel thought.
But for her and her community, death is nothing new.
She put down her phone until that evening she reopened the tract and read a text about the gathering of the people of Kampfield.
There's a picture of the police and what people call a scream, and there's a picture of a man named Brown's father, which says, "The Frogson police just killed my innocent son!"
She saw a message from a local police station with a dog stand in front of a group of protesters.
She said, in another video, another cop picked up his gun and called out: "I'll kill all of you... the animals."
"It's not normal," Ferrel recalled.
"It's not what we're used to, it can be called a typical murder. "
At that moment, I felt so tired.
I'm angry. I'm crying."
She's on her way back. She's home the next day.
At 11:00 a.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's home and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
For the next three years, what happened to Ferrel and Förgson was the theme of a new film "Who's Street" that appeared in the theater on August 11.
This is one relevant to living in this community, meeting the needs of people in the big streets to receive answers to life and protest, love and loss, strength and strength.
Férel and his daughter (with flowers, with ornaments) drove to Förson, and again discussed their discussion several times before that morning, "The experience of black people and the situation of black people".
"Do you remember when I taught you that black people must fight for their faith?" she recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, that's not right.
I have to take her, "Ferrell later.
"The thing that's happened today is everything that's happened...
She wants to know, see and wake up from this thing.
She not only needs to develop well in terms of promotionalism and organization but also to understand the different dimensions of the experience of black people and the situation of black people and to know what we must do to gain freedom and freedom.
Even though I'm happy to provide her with the experience of racism that she has not experienced in her own body, she has nothing to do with other black girls.
If I protect her in this thing, I think I'm hurting her."
They arrived at the first station in Förgson, a place facing the South Carolina police station, where passengers were forced to wait until the result of the last arrest of police officer Darlen Wilson became their camp.
Férel and her daughter contacted a local business chief who was preparing lunch.
They've got a bag ready to deliver it to the protesters.
Gradually, Ferrel began to form a new type of activism.
She said, "My enthusiasm for progress has changed completely after 9 August. " When Louis University of Missouri, St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Minority Hospitals and was concerned about the food justice and health gap in the black communities.
"I have no organizational experience.
It's all here."
A few weeks later, Ferrel met with Sabah Foleyan on a night's tour.
Folejan says what happened with her film director Lucas Alvarado Faler "just wanted to record."
The question is, "Do you want to record or find a story you can use?"
This suspicion comes from many of these cases: people -- usually white -- enter a community to benefit from their suffering and perseverance.
"We have heard that the people of Förson are not focused on their voices, but we want to do it in different ways."
Foleyan is already in contact with a joint actor, Damon Davis, a well-known regional artist for the promotion of death-prisoning prisoners.
His participation led to the "Who Street" project team, which had not been left unattended for years after the bombing of Brown.
"This record is not a person who speaks to us or speaks to us, it is our speech." David said.
"I'm particularly concerned about how these people appear, because it's also the way I'm shown. "
Although the goal is not to focus on Férel's experience – but to show this movement "not on the world's leaders, but on the community's commitment," Foley says – the fact that she is the most open of the film participants.
As a result, "Who's Street?" Surprisingly recorded Ferrel's personal life, such as entering the river of love and getting married.
"I feel like I'm ugly," Farrell laughed when he first saw the stuff.
" But I understand that doing this work and humanizing black people must have certain vulnerability. "
In addition, Férel's story reaffirmed and re-established the role of black and white women in a broader black life event.
Two of the three authors of the campaign -- who created #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 Black Young Trevor Martin shot in 2012 -- were identified as cool.
"The black and white women in the leadership are all involved in the campaign," said Ferrel, "that is because we are fighting on many lines of war.
The black whore must accept all of this. "
Félejan agreed and referred to " The movement has truly received support from black women and many black women. "
Because of her identity, Farrell was selected as the center of the video, but she insisted that "this is not a certain action for things".
"She's a man of power," she said.
"Although she's on the front line, it's not a coincidence, because in the life of these cross roads, as a black whore woman, you've got a lot to do.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy."
At the same time, in Frgson, the media have already disappeared, but there is still a strong racial relationship between communities and police.
Because of trying to block high-speed roads during a trip, Ferrel was sentenced to more than two and a half years ' imprisonment.
She described the social political environment of the area she called home: " A bad group. "
Nevertheless, since she had been on the streets of Försen three years ago, she has been holding on to the sacred songs she has tried to remember.
"We have the responsibility to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must support each other.
We're no longer lost, except the locks on us."
In fact, online translation services had already been provided over the past decade, and in fact earlier, the argument "mechanicals are about to replace human beings" had never been heard.
Similar: DNA created by the artist Chelsea Manning
In the center of New York Freedman american exhibitions there are several fronts: white, black and red, and there are almost undetectable similarities between each side, and these are lined down from the ceiling.
This 30 film was created by the artist Dewey-Hagborg (Dewey-Hagborg) using Chelsea to send her face prints and haircuts.
Mannin was released from the prison in Liverenburg and was sentenced to 35 years in prison by secret diplomatic telegrams through the Wiki-Khiddeen website.
The exhibition opened on August 2, entitled "The same place".
This is the result of a two-year communication between Haggburg and Manning, where Duweh Haggberg combines his education with his own technology, computer science and art, while Mannin is a well-known diverse political observer who has entered and completed a sexual operation in prison. The former President of the United States, Obama, three days before the end of his term of office, apologized for her rest of the punishment.
Its comments are both multiplicity for DNA and the concept itself.
The name Bradley Edward (Bradley Edward), born in Manning, was publicly recognized as a woman in her early teens. In 2013 she was convicted of 20 allegations, including 6 inter-law offences, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was restrained, with only one picture, with a dark black from her face, seemed to be obvious insecurity, sitting on a chair, wearing a golden fad.
In 2015, Histerdouwe Habog achieved a great success in her 2012 project " Stranger Visions " .
In that work, she used a paper from the middle court of tobacco and oral sugar to create similar 3D human imagery from DNA derived from fragments.
That's an e-mail from paper magazine.
"They want to meet in prison with Chersie Mannin and need a picture," Hessedow Habog told the media on the opening night of the exhibition.
She couldn't watch it or take it, so they contacted Cherie and asked if she was interested in making DNA photos.
So this artist and her prisoner, José, became an impossible friend and exchanged many letters in two years.
They even created a film "pressure film", drawn by Shoili Kanungo.
And Obama asked her to be released a few days after the publication.
In addition, there is another deep interest in this event, because in the United States of America, the Government of Tranquo continues to declare war on government secretaries and mutatis mutandis, while looking for new ways to do so in the way that it can be done in the first place, and this is about to collapse.
When asked about all this special time, Hesterdow Habog said, "There is reason for anything that happens."
In an artist's statement on the wall, Manning's super-magnificent signature is below (the name "i" is drawn from a heart) and calls for the end of "by sex, sexual orientation and culture-based parties. "
On the front wall is her cell DNA sequence, with a cross-sectional cross-section of Cs, Gs and As symbols.
By including 200 letters (or nuclear acids, a complex scientific dictionary for every artist), Histerdouwi Habog wanted to express at least on the physiological structure, and people all wanted to do so.
"I hope people will get out of this situation, our genetic group will not care who we are, how we read the public genetic data, how they are, how they are, how they are, how they are, and how they are the subject," said Hesterdow Habog, his 2007 film work "a false memory" was also being shown.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so this is 30 of them."
The last piece in the exhibition, in one room, comes from a page in the front cover.
The U.S. soldiers showed up under the expansion machine, which was designed by Kim.
"When they stop your talk, they win," wrote on the wall.
"So don't shut up. "
"These items came from her letter to me," said the artist from the city.
"I'm scared again. I'm still going to say it."
Mannin has not yet seen this show herself, as predicted in the film, but when she does, she will be welcomed by her own DNA camera, like a group of protesters at the center of the exhibition.
This was also intended, as was the case with all the items in the exhibition, to reach the height of the information she had written on her genetic code (2.2 meters, Mannin's body height).
"In the past, I put them on the wall, but I hope they think they're like a group," said Doweh Haggburg about the picture.
"But I want them to feel like a group of protesters with Cherie, just like people were going to release her. "
Professor of the University of North West and staff of the University of Oxford were arrested for murder.
The police indicated that a man was found injured in Chicago City, where a professor of the North West University and a staff member of the University of Oxin were subsequently contacted and is currently looking for suspects within the country.
The records of the Cook Court show that on Monday, 42-year-old Wendm Lesem and 56-year-old Andrew Wallen were sentenced to death by law without warrant in the case of Metrenton H. James Conner Dolanlo.
According to the document record, 26-year-old Conner Duranol died of multiple injuries.
The community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department stated that the body was found on 27 July.
After the police got on the phone to Grand Plaza apartment, they found how much damage was done to the victim.
The police claimed Conner Duranlo's death and were investigating his murder, while the police were actively looking for two suspects.
Since 2007, Lesem has been a professor of microbiology and immune sciences at the University of North Westphalia.
In an e-mail statement, the Deputy Director of the School Relations Service, Alan K. Kobechi, indicated that Lesem is now out of office and has been banned from entering the University of North-West.
Kobechi said, "This is now a criminal case where the relevant authorities are investigating and the University of North-West is actively involved in the investigation. "
Warren is a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
In an e-mail statement, the speaker of the Samuvir University of Oxin stated: " We have kept contact with the British police and are always ready to assist the United States investigative institutions as necessary. "
The statement adds that Wallen's colleagues were deeply shocked and wished he could vote for himself.
The chief contact officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Gorelmi, strongly encourages suspects to take the lead in the authorities.
Gülermi stated that " the police have already had an idea of their fate, and we are trying to establish a possible location. "
Gülermi stated that local, regional and national authorities are working hard to assist in the search for suspects.
Gülermi stated that the police had received a call from the Director of the Grand Plaza apartment, and he had just received a secret statement that 1008 of the apartment had occurred.
The police said the situation was very scary at the time.
Gülermi stated that it was still unclear whether the event was also taking place on 27 July.
He said, according to the security picture, he confirmed Lesem and Warren at the time in the building.
"We believe that Professor Leesem and the victims have a certain relationship," Gorelmi said.
The management team of Grand Plaza issued a statement to the population that " police are currently investigating the time line and background of the victims and are investigating various motives, including possible domestic events " .
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said, "We will complete the world's path map in the near future."
The Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, Vitaly Mutko, said that the implementation of the remaining standards of the World Anti-Fraud Agency (WADA) on the restoration of the rights of the Russian Anti-Fraud Body (RUSADA) would not take too long.
" The implementation of road map standards has already been carried out at a certain stage, and RUSADA has the right to plan and test plans and tests in cooperation with UKAD.
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard," Mutt.
In commenting on the second part of the World Roadmap "compliance with the provisions " , the Deputy Prime Minister Mutko set out the criteria for restoring the rights of RUSADA and recently published on the organization ' s website.
According to Mutoko, the criteria do not include any of the things that may cause Russian concerns.
He added, "Everything has to be declared and everything will be implemented.
And in the near future, the results will be submitted to the International OIC and WADA. "
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list was that Russia's anti-emergency agencies must be publicly accepted by Canada's lawyer Richard Michaelen on WADA's findings on the State support for the use of anti-emergency events in their national sports campaigns.
In this regard, Mutt said: "We are investigating that our immune system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind it, and we will not recognize anything that does not exist. "
Mutko responded to Vitali Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Fraud Commission.
Smirnov recognized the existence of Russia's anti-fraud agencies in the Russian outlet RSport earlier that day, but he added: "We have said many times in various places that the report contains positions and provisions of dispute.
No one planned to accept the report without conditions," Smirnov said.
In November 2015, following the release of the vaccine, WADA suspended the right of RUSADA to carry out an antioxidants inspection in Russia.
However, in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UNHCR.
WADA, Director-General Olivia Niggrey, when visiting the organization at its headquarters in Moscow in July, said that RUSADA was "in the right direction", trying to restore its rights.
For computers, whether they are chess or national chess, the defeat of humanity is no longer under way decades ago.
Daww-Suk, President of the Croatian Federation, said that China's participation in the interview was significant for Croatia's football, and China's prize numbers were very high.
I don't have to buy any more than 8,000 products!
The Department of Commerce, held on 11 January, issued an example of the press release, stated that there are currently 15 self-trafficking agreements that have been implemented by our country, involving 23 countries and regions, covering over 8,000 zero-rate import products.
At the same time, imported goods, Iceland's triangular fish, Chile's red wine, Asian hot fruits... you don't have to buy these products for money.
At present, our country has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, 15 of which have been implemented and over 8,000 imports of zero duty are covered.
For example, with the implementation of the trade agreement, consumer products can be obtained from different sources for a four-year period of time, with quality and priced agricultural products.
For example, the Astana roses, the roses, the hot fruits such as the fireflowers, and the import tariffs fell from 15 to 30 per cent to zero.
(a) The import duties on third-country fishing vessels fell from 10 to 12 per cent as zero-rate;
Red wine in Georgia and Chile, import tariffs fell from 14 per cent to 30 per cent as zero duty;
There are also higher taxes on special agricultural products such as beef and milk in New Zealand.
Industrial goods, for example, were reduced to zero by the duty on imports of fragmented goods from Switzerland;
Part of the manual import tariffs decreased by 50 per cent and would fall into zero tariffs in a few years;
Korea's electric fridge, electric kettles, mossy and sweetener products import tariffs have decreased by 40 per cent and will be reduced by zero duty several years later;
There are also higher taxes on electronic products, such as consumer goods.
At the same time, zero-tax products under the trade zone also included the intermediate and raw materials required for the production of domestic end- consumer products, as well as the structural increase in national consumption.
The Department of Commerce's press speaker was very proud to say that almost one third of our total imports could benefit from the treatment of preferential tariffs for trade agreements, most of which were final consumption and brought real benefits to consumers.
Further reductions in import duties on consumer goods
Since 1 December 2017, our country has adjusted the import duties of certain consumer goods and has further reduced the import duties of consumer goods, covering food, health care, drugs, daily supplies, shoes, household equipment, cultural entertainment, and various types of consumer goods, including 187 8 taxes.
The average rate of taxation for these products will fall from 17.3 per cent to 7.7 per cent, almost by "floating"!
Since 1 January 2018, our country has also made partial adjustments to other import tariffs.
(b) Import tariffs from 10 per cent to 5 per cent of the imports of fractions of beet, oats and water, such as oats, oats and water;
The reduction in customs duties means that consumers do not have to buy and that there is no longer a need for foreign products that are preferred outside the country of old age.
The 2018 import of goods: imports of red wines, cereals, fruits... are easy!
Outlets: U.S. last year's commercial provisions vary considerably.
New Internet Power 29 December
According to the U.S. "World Day" report, the Christmas season is just over and it's over.
According to the U.S. Broadcasting Company (ABC), over half of the goods sold last year were returned.
In addition, a number of readers have been deceived into buying explosives networks and consumers need to be more concerned when buying non-formal websites.
In general, large purchase companies have formal and reasonable disposal procedures, but if they buy gifts or electronics from some small shops, they must be careful.
Ms. Rolang's local sister bought an outlet on a web site that was sold on 1 December, with over $60 (US$, respectively), which has not yet been sent.
She sent a mail to her client, and she couldn't answer it.
There were also Web-based explosives, last year's U.S. travel, buying a cell phone to third-party sellers, and later found in it a box of leather.
Upon being deceived, the website is requested for reimbursement and full reimbursement.
However, there are also customers who believe that the site's retirement service is not a percentage of perfect.
A North American resident king said that he had purchased twice a site ' s emergency delivery service for four dollars, but he had not sent it on time twice.
The application for reparation was subsequently rejected and was not answered.
Large markets or acquisitions have better returns policies.
Macy's spent most of the goods within 180 days.
But the goods must keep "the original" and purchase certificates such as receipts or bank purchase records.
If there is no evidence, customers can also obtain a market share and can be used to purchase other goods.
Target is normally 90 days for general goods, and electronics are usually 15 days.
However, electronics purchased during the period from 1 November to 25 December 2017, the period of withdrawal of recreational goods was up to 30 days.
It should be noted that the 30-day retirement period is beginning on 25 December, which is to be reimbursed by 25 January 2018.
It's very expensive. It's a new generation of commercial purchases.
More than ten years ago, our country was also on the market in general, with limited choices and needs.
However, after decades of development, the market has already achieved a shift from the market to the market for buyers, and now consumers are enjoying a better taste and they are no longer satisfied with the simple "hand hand-held delivery" of goods.
As a result, how consumers were given a very high purchase experience has become the next point of competition for land-producing developers.
However, the impact of the shopping centre in the business circle is of the greatest importance in many factors affecting consumer procurement experience.
See how city-builders are focusing on the acquisition experience.
There are no two completely the same plants in the world, no more two completely the same shopping centers, and a well-known shopping centre must have its own features.
For example, Kanyon, a shopping center known as Turkey, was inspired by its unique construction of a well-known bogeyon from the Canyon Valley, so it was named Canyon by a voice and was located within a 200-metre walk of the canyon, the central minister of the Canyon.
In addition to the design of the canals, there is a large-scale round-the-the-clock exhibition in the centre of the shopping center, which is unique and often special.
As an open platform design, it allows visitors to travel at each level to watch the activities carried out in the "Chief Hall" and have the effect of changing perspectives.
And within the country, the South China Forest Moor Business Street, which is called the leading Chinese forest pro-consumption, will bring together goods with ecosystems and children's language in perfect harmony.
7000 square kilometers of land, 3,000 square kilometres of water, a project consisting of 9 units of buildings, a combination of space between buildings, and the entire basements designed to produce French wood on the ground as a platform for building, a water surface, and a sense of forest gardens.
Walking into the forest, like a bird that accidentally dives into the Elysian desert memory, surrounded by trees, built around the building, painted, cleaned up, and brought people into a forest filled with organic and alive.
It is also in the process of rejuvenating the well-being of the Red Sea, planning hundreds of businesses, planning for the future to enter more than 50 international-level specialty banner shops, and more than 100 international-level cards and 500 domestic-named cards, which form a collection of services industry, with a theme-specific commercial centre.
In addition, the well-being of the water industry will also be integrated into the building, leading to public transport to TOD, the collective purchase of goods, services, food, entertainment, education and the movement together, while bringing consumers to the experience of highly purchased objects, and lead them to enjoy a unique "water culture", which will bring them together together in perfect integrity.
In general, a part of the building has now been discovered in this new urban business, while business people have indicated that it is focused on consumer testing and how consumer models combined with testing will also be the main focus of future urban development.
The current trade circle is not only a collection of goods, but more is an integrated culture of art, a complex place of creative themes, and also a responsibility for people living in the city.
Thus, while consumers are satisfied with the need for a steady exercise, the largest transfer of cultural art and living needs, which are essential for future business development, must be high.
On the resurgence of the famous North-West Bank, on the north coast of the country, near the sound tower, near the world's business fair, around the world's right-hand side of the border, one-off card collection, and close contact with the international time.
It's going to take a walk here, and it's going to be a great world.
The East Bank has a better purchasing environment, and the East Bank is located near the South-South corner, enjoying a four-dimensional system of transport that is even the leading country in the West.
(a) In addition to the benefits of the work path and of the two-way greening of the countryside in the Wadda districts, the map of the site has been recorded, the cultivation of approximately 300 hectares of tomatoes, the transformation of the area of 40,000 square metres and the expansion of the South-West Chamber of Commerce;
And the Red Sea, which is nearing the first low-pressure water trade resort - the nine-circuit water store, surrounded by nine parks, the low-pressure, the commercial street area, the high level of openness, the willingness of people to stop, stay and enjoy the goods, rather than the interest of the people behind, has become more and more busy, and has actually achieved "progressive procurement".
Today's commercial competition will only become more intense, and how to kill a blood in a highly qualityd market, gain the glory of the "purchasing sanctuary" in the hearts of future consumers, which is worthy of serious consideration by all housing producers.
It is not far enough for a single detached strategy, but only those who really put consumers in the heart of the consumer, who are in a hurry and think that what consumers think is possible for the development of very, very short purchases for consumers can laugh at lakes in the markets that are present in the storm.
Of course, to the end, I want the most happy or resuscitated people who have such a good purchase experience and business circle and no one can imagine today's prosperity before 10 years ago.
Materials: Consumerism has hidden real environmental prices
It is $182 million, which is the amount of the consumer's consumption within 24 hours of the "Twenty-first World Fascist Christmas" on 11 November 2017.
In particular, after the "two 11" is started, the short three-minute delivery of the baby will break into 100 billion and 6-05 seconds more than 200 billion dollars and 9 hours of 10 billion.
On that day, global consumers reached 148 million dollars by paying the total amount of their valuables and 41 per cent more than last year's growth.
These consumptions will produce an estimated 812 million items.
And whether it's a heavenly witness network or paying for a precious payment platform, it's all part of the Ali group.
Ten years ago no one would have thought that on 11 November, a single youth from a culture created by self-contained "Bi11" will be eccentrically collected as a "Bi11" shopping season at the present level.
On 11 November 2009, Al-Bababa was the first to use the "Chief of the Light" shop: no one talked to you about love, so let's buy "one dog" quickly.
As a result, it is unlikely that this day's rich commercial city (formerly "the sky ") would have violated the trade of $52 million, which was the 10 times that of the daily transaction.
Since then, "Two 11" has become the most popular purchases made in Alabama, from the start of the domestic buyer's self-sustainment, to the present day of the global trade, nine years ago, the "two 11" billion-dollar transactions have been more than 3200 times that year, and the "Fiveth Black" has been expected to be on the market.
There are a lot of electricians who are the most powerful of them.
"Kinty" has its own purchase segment "6.18", but no "Bi11" has a significant impact this year, from 1 November to 11 this year, "Kinti" has reached $127 billion.
And after "two 11", the next thing that's like "two 12" is crazy, the New Year's shopping archive.
Over the next year, China's consumers were waiting for an annual procurement period before the spring season, for lovers to buy, spend, and not leave.
The environmental problems resulting from long-term marine consumption have caused concern for professionals and institutions.
According to The New York Daily Phone News, the normal standard for each pack of 0.2 hectares in the business is maintained, which produces at least over 300,000 tons of waste during the "two 11" period of this year.
The Head of the Greenpeace Project Project to Combat Pollution in East Asia told the interior dialogue that this year only 160,000 tons of waste will be collected by the scheduled units of "two 11" only on Sundays.
The National Post Office has issued a report in 2016 that the rapid figure for the period "Bi11" (11-16 November) for 2015 is approximately 7.8 million dollars, using over 300 million packages, 99.22 million packages and 169.85 million metric tons, with a length of 425 square metres.
This year, the National Post Office is expected to have more than 15 million operations on "two 11s".
The Governor of a gas station in Beijing told Newway that the wastes that entered the "two 11" every day were more than 2000 tons and more than the processing capacity of the combustion plants.
Fast shipping companies have already realized that environmental pollution caused by rapid shipping is not visible.
Before "two 11" some businesses, including the Sun, launched a speedy delivery box that could be reused, which could be recycled as a pack of goods and bags of waste, but which did not increase the acceptance of the consumer concerned.
The mahogany also supports "green packaging" and "green material" in the micro-biography industry.
It's got more than 68,000 "grass".
What kind of move do the Germans want to pay?
Winter: Movements launched in Germany are not expected to pay for the war.
Micro-credit payments and precious payments have moved the battlefield into Europe, the competitors have not changed, the capture has not changed — Chinese, is it also globalization?
There's a rich place to pay for. There's got to be a small loan.
In accordance with the agreement of the German electronic payment service provider Wirecard, micro-mails were paid to Germany in November of this year, and were gradually operated by traders within Europe.
This two-year-old national reconnaissance took place in Europe.
For a long time, payment of wealth and microcredit has been paid on the way to globalization.
With regard to the globalization of China ' s migration, the "Third Third Party of China 's Industrial Payment Research 2017" summarized two types: one through strategic investment, experience in export, unit membership and corporate support for foreign land movements.
The second was through the consumption of Chinese tourists and the promotion of services to foreign traders, which changed the awareness and acceptance of foreign land payments to Chinese movements.
Of course, Chinese have to get under the sky.
China's economic development is rapid, as well as a large population base. China's travel in Europe is one of the most expensive.
However, it was also noted that this time China's movement in Germany was not expected to pay for war.
The payment of micro-credit and the payment of valuables has moved the war scene to Europe, has not changed, has been stolen or has not changed — or has it been globalized?
A more expansive survey is that China's movement is able to pay for landfilling in Europe?
For example, in Germany.
The "new sale" of magic.
Zhao, Zhao Qao: Amazon declared entry into military stores and warehouses when it entered the world’s ten largest retailer, regardless of time or motivation.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first entity library in West Asia and then opened two libraries in Portland and Santiago.
In Ibe 2017, Amazon opened a store in New York and planned to have at least eight shops by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced that no one under the flag would be able to run the Amazon Go test, that customers would not need a series or an account, that would leave the goods they wanted, and that the purchase would automatically be removed from the Amazon account of their customers.
In the case of Amazon, it has been a very rare phenomenon in recent years that often occurs in the entity store.
As CEOJev Betzs, in his 2007 "public letter to the shareholders", stressed that it would not be easy for Amazon to open an entity store unless it met the following four conditions:
1. We must be convinced that this new opportunity will enable the shareholders to return their investments;
We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great importance to the entire company;
We must be convinced that this new opportunity is being ignored by the market;
We must be convinced that in this market we have sufficient resources to make a difference to customers.
The bookstores and counterfeits are the most popular category of wanton sales in the two entities, as well as the first opponent after Amanda's awakening.
Amazon announced that the two entities marketed in the world's ten largest retailer, whether on time or on motive, would be fun.
Amazon's practice and the assurances contained in his letter are against each other?
The other side of the planet has heard similar voices. On 13 October 2016, at the 2016 district convention, the President of the Governor's Office of Albania made a speech on the theme.
He said: "From the beginning of next year, the expression 'electronic commerce' will no longer be mentioned.
The age of pure electricians will soon end, and in the next decade, 20 years will be without electronic commerce and instead will be replaced by ‘new retail’.
There will be a new sale under the line and a combination of materials. "
On one occasion, the three words "new sales" were used as magic, often by businessmen at the mouth.
But what does "new sales" really mean?
If it's just linked to the line, it's not new.
In 2016, eMarketer followed up with 180 largest electricians, estimated that the total sales of electricians amounted to about US$ billion and that the largest 25 of them amounted to $1590 million.
Of these 25 families, 18 were traditional retailers who started on the line in the last five years (e.g. Messie, Nordstrom, Target, Gap etc.).
And there are 283 million members of the Al-Aribaba group in the Sunni unit, and they are also on the scene.
From a global point of view, retailers and electricians are moving from one channel to an entity-covered store, electricians, mobile and socialized media.
Is the "new sale" more a summary than a future prospect?
If not, what's the difference between the concept of a whole channel?
Maybe the key to the problem isn't online and it won't be integrated under the line but how.
Recalling the past 20 years in the retail industry, the rise of electricians, such as the rise in early years with retailers, focused on prices and facilities.
Depending on these two pain points, the electricians transferred high standardization products, such as books and CDs, from the line below to the line.
As the online custom of consumer cultivation and customer experience continue to increase, electricians are also exposed to other types of goods and begin to increase efficiency.
With the encouragement of Albania ' s CEO, "Utilizing Internet ideas and technologies to fully reform and upgrade the total number of existing social retailers, enables China ' s increased consumer consumption needs to be effectively met and the process of production, transport and services throughout the product world has become more effective because of the Internet and the widespread use of data by China ' s consumers. "
So the path of the electrician is a light-looking asset and a path of real-time assets.
"Little" means fixed assets, staffing, management processes without traditional retailes; "best", means a huge investment in materials, storage.
The change in the means of communication has guaranteed the efficiency of the electricians.

On 18 January, on the occasion of the reconvenement of the Conference on the Eradication of Electronics From Poverty, Al-Aribaba announced a new "Internet + Eradication of Poverty" model to facilitate the rationalization of the eradication of poverty and rural life.
This was followed by a rural strategy to launch a rural mining project, an on-line rural poverty eradication platform, and the establishment of the Al-Kali Poverty Fund after the establishment of the Al-Babaat Fund, and the "guarantee" for the fight against poverty.
Eradicatement of poverty is one of China's most important national strategies.
The total eradication of poverty in China has never been achieved in the past few thousand years.
“Electrical poverty is a new innovative initiative for poverty eradication, an important key player in achieving the eradication of poverty.
The central importance and point out that the Internet can play an important role in helping to eradicate poverty, promote the effective eradication of poverty, eradicate poverty, and enable agricultural products to leave villages through the Internet. "
As a result, in 2014, Ali had proposed a rural strategy to calculate and globalize large data gaps and to be listed as a three-year core strategy for the future 20 years of Ali.
In the same year, Ali launched a rural mining project to recruit "Little II" in rural areas, bringing farmers to poverty through the e-commerce.
In 2017, Ali, in cooperation with the commercial sector, launched a campaign to promote agricultural poverty, currently accounting for 13 provinces in the country and 120 national levels of poverty.
There are 2118 beautiful villages on the Ali platform.
Nearly 400 out of these countries are poor, 33 out of 13 countries are poor.
In 2017, the national value-added village sales totalled $1.6 billion on the Chinese market.
He expressed his courage to address the national strategy to eradicate poverty, and Ali had been thinking about how to use the best technology of the Arab economies, the great amount of data and the innovative capacity of accounting, to get out of poverty a new way.
The village was the main platform for the removal of poverty by the Ali electrician, and a direct-destruction Internet route was channeled from the poverty line.
In the plant cycle, rural and mountain-based clothing is jointly supported by agricultural materials and small loans.
In 2017, 795 of the 832 national poor-level poor people served as goldsmiths, providing them with an easy payment, credit, etc.
The food cane handle storage and flow, which is responsible for sales, and the large data from Alijun directed agricultural production, further enhancing supply standards for agricultural products, quality and market competitiveness.
The development of electricians from poverty not only requires products, sales routes, industrial planning, but also requires people.
Ali, through the introduction of a vocational training course at the University of Wyoming, has taught farmers standardization, qualityization and scaled-up farming methods and has achieved a combination of "poverty and caring" to enable farmers to overcome poverty on a sustainable basis.
These courses have covered about 92 per cent of the national poverty line.
And the "good-willing attitude, commercial means" approach to poverty can also ensure that Ali makes "the most miserable" when he is in poverty.
The President of the Governor-General of Alabama stated that poverty eradication should be divided into poverty eradication and poverty eradication and three phases of prosperity.
Poverty is the allocation of fish, the removal of poverty is the allocation of fish and the development of a "fish" for farmers, making it possible for farmers to feed.
The industry's powered by electricity is the production of fish.
In terms of industrial poverty, Ali, in cooperation with the Sierra Leone River, has been promoted as an example by the relevant sectors in national copying.
Ali has also been approved by the decision-making level.
E-enterprises represented by Al-Aribaba have been sent online to ensure increases in agricultural production.
A number of small and medium-sized mining and mining workers were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experience in the eradication of poverty.
At present, the United Nations World Food Programme Office in China has been working with rural communities and is implementing the e-commerce industry in the same area as Anguilla.
The New Economics News was held on 16 January at the Third New Economics Conference, held by the Ali Institute, in which China witnessed and spoke on 16 January at the Chamber of Commerce's e-business office.
She felt that our globalization had actually ignored the most important issue, namely, the physical and useful issues of globalization and the phase of globalization.
Many people feel that globalization has stopped, and many developed and developing countries, in the new phase, are different from those of the model.
The second concept is the issue of the mid-term phase of globalization, and what is the extent of the mid-term restriction of globalization?
The restrictions imposed by the economic environment base are due to changes in the economic base.
In the view that the global economic adjustment was essentially completed by the end of 2017 and that a new cycle of growth would be introduced after 2018 and the next cycle would be the production slow.

"In 2018 we will enter the country quickly, before spring, in Beijing, on the sea, and the state will open a large store."
The "new method" of 2018 was released at the second New Market Conference on 10 May 2018.
" Since 2018 the box has been not only a live electrician but also a living-class electrician who serves consumers.
Under the core model line is inflation, testing, real sales on the line."
Unlike traditional wholesale shops, supermarkets, boxing in many consumers is a "net store" that is fun to eat, even some middle institutions have developed the concept of "boxroom".
The telecommunications platform and retailer under the line have various advantages, while consumers are in many channels, so both parties are trying their way through the channel.
In the business, it is believed that, in the large context of consumer growth, the "class of horse" portals in 2018 will be increasing.
The box, on the other hand, has continued to explore more areas of consumption from the first generation to the new year, and the retail market is expected to be more innovative.
"For example, the online mode of operation attracts consumers' eyes, and the open live supermarkets are called good. "
"But these relationships are more and more useless and I finally realized that you didn't bring a good test to consumers, and I tried to buy a list. "
It appears that under the new retail environment, consumers are accustomed to changing habits and purchasing demand.
In the original line, the line is broken, the line is broken, the line is broken, and the line is attacked, now it's joined, because consumers are no longer separated from the line.
The fight against capital has led to the fact that new fossil fuels currently represented in the capital are being spent in the capital market.

Helps you avoid company becoming the next-priority company
Amy Erett once wanted to create the happiness of the company's investigators in her early e-commerce, but the investigation had no effect.
The responses received are often unnecessary, useless and even more misleading.
Even though she has committed herself to using a reputation, some staff members still do not believe in this process.
Eret, responsible for managing the 75-year-old Banking Electronic Business Supply Company Madison Reed, stated that "the lack of consistency and objectivity in the response received".
So she called for help outside.
A number of new human resources companies, such as the rain and the rain, have been created to help companies understand the feelings of workers.
They designed and authorized software specifically for measuring the participation of workers, thus enabling companies to carry out rapid civilian testing for specific groups and groups of people, provide staff with names and complaints lines and, in some cases, allow journalists to report directly to the Board of Directors.
"Now, you can track your health status through tools such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit from company?" Glint's co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Banett.
Erete stated that within three years, she had received more views on the ideas and feelings of staff members using Glint.
In addition to the rapid investigation and civilization of the specific team, Glint also provided a map of the company, which of the units most complained, which of the managers were low in number of approvals, one of which made it possible for her to understand why.
Companies began to realize that they had to be trained to manage their company's job culture so as not to become the next priority. A blog post described the disturbing environment prior to its work was published, and the speakers were punished by the company, and the advantages were later distorted.
For a company such as Glint, the company's desire for supervision is a countless business.
According to data from the Financial Technology Analysis website Let's Talk Payments, by 2020 the value of global governance, regulation and co-regulation could exceed $1.187 billion.
Convercent of the original creation company in Danvar, Colorado, was committed to helping companies prevent and detect misconduct and saw an increase in interest and activity in this regard during the early years of well-known losses.
CONVERCENT has nearly 600 clients, including him, microbe and tesla.
The advantage of the recent contract is to become a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent can send a structured "research" survey to the company to collect confidential responses and check the map of its problem region.
Convercent also provides anonymous letter hotline, making employees report bad behavior.
If the Director is contacted, the complaint will enter the Board directly.
The founder and chief executive officer of the Convercent said: "The Court has denied the authority of the regulatory body.
If a company has been found to be ill-treatment workers or to show misconduct against employees, even if the regulatory body is not involved, it may also face consumer restraint, with high consequences for the loss of workers and for their involvement in proceedings.
Ruby Tuesday is a restaurant with over 500 locations and over 25,000 employees, which has been used for over a year by Converter to ensure that workers understand working standards and work procedures and provide easy access to company headquarters.
In the meantime, if staff members want to report issues, they must find the company ' s telephone number or e-mail, submit formal complaints, and hope that Headquarters will be able to deal with them seriously.
This is often a frightening and disturbing experience, and Ruby Tuesday's legal adviser, James Vitlano, said that he felt there was no good way to track the complaints of staff.
But now that the company uses Convertert, it will be able to find and solve problems that are unknown to the city or state authorities, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay.
"I can be closer to 360 degrees fully aware of work experience," said Vitrano of the ruby Tuesday Risk Management Team.
" We are protecting our units from being subjected to employment proceedings. "
Künland stated that since the closure of the Andor Accountant Service because of the security of information in violation of moral norms, companies have begun to place greater emphasis on morals, values and employee employment since 2002.
But until "Social Media enters its own world", companies realized that they could not prevent their explosives from spreading on the Internet.
"Before the use of technology surveillance, people viewed hope as a strategy," he said.
Glint and Converternt both provided their software as a service and collected regular costs for companies to collect products.
Such business models and business opportunities are supported by risk investors, who have provided support to both original companies.
In February, Convercent collected $1,000,000 from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with total capital rising to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $1,000,000 from Bessemer Venture Partners, which totalled $6 million.
Given the interrelationship between companies, cultural and risk investments, these investments are not surprising.
A growing number of studies show that staff are higher than expected in the workplace today.
High-paying and interesting projects in such competitive markets as the Kung fu are just notes.
Staff members wish to feel accepted and valued and feel their time spent on a company that has a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join the company and feel that their voice is heard and their work is useful, they will be more committed to making it a success," said Vice-President Nina McCartney of Global Welfare and Staff Experience.
Investors are able to make a return on the good performance of their investment group companies; companies are good when they are faithful and respectful.
If third-party analytical tools are committed to increasing the integrity and integrity of workers, they will also be unable to find financial support.
The cultural experts at the workplace say that data on staff are very important.
However, these data are of no use unless the company's administrators take action.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can be expected that the company is making changes.
If the change is not rapid enough or there is no progress, it may lead to disappointment and to the separation of employees from the company.
"If you want to look for 4000 recommendations, you need to prepare for 4000 dialogues." He saw errors that some companies were too dependent on data collection.
"Because if it doesn't work out, the employee will think, 'Have you really heard me?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why do I care?"
Eret stated that Madison Reed is now conducting a monthly staff survey and has been able to take action on the day of Glint's report.
After gathering staff on their feedback about their decision-making speed and quality of communication, she was able to address the problem through the reorganization team within the company to increase communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is receiving new views on its staff, and from a long distance away they hope that they will be able to move into a sector that is known as low-level and better to retain workers.
"If you don't want to create a transparent culture, you'll lose people," Vitrano said.
"If you lose someone, you will lose your client.
And when you lose your client, you lose your company."

NCAA Cancel training twice a day and extend training time for the white bear.
At about 11:00 p.m., a team of football team members from the University of California met at the new campus.
Some of the members of the team have left the movement and have revealed the body that they were trying to train after the first day of the training camp.
For a large part of the team, it's a few minutes of rest.
The members of the summer course will return after three hours of training, after which they will return to the final test for the accommodation period and return to Wasserman at the meeting on the next morning at 6:30 p.m.
"The next three days is a match for these guys," the team coach Jim Mora said when he was about to enter the second week.
NCAA has canceled two daily training sessions (with a view to reducing the burden of gambling), but actually extended their training time in the white days - at least before the end of Friday.
This is why the first three classes of the University of Los Angeles are scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to adapt to the schedules that have been set up by the players.
From one day to more than one day, two day training was conducted by the Corps during almost a week prior to the previous season, and the first time in the six season of Westwood was training in the school of the Goths.
They planned to start 18 training courses from August 20 and then to start an official race for the first month of the Warde State.
Mora said he supported the adjustment of NCAA's rules, although this would also increase the work of the players.
"In three or four days, we will give them a great amount of training, very challenging," Mora said.
"They've just adopted, they're training, they're both great kids.
I thought about Saturday, we'd have more time, really great."
At the end of the camp, the University of Los Angeles will stop training. In view of the nearby parking lot and the Luskin Center's clean-up line, this is not an easy task.
At the beginning of this week, the team will be staying at the hotel, but Mora admits that when these rooms are aired during the season, problems may arise.
"We'll take security measures," Mora said.
"It's a really disturbing problem, which is that someone might rent a room and sit in a training area in the room, which is not a strong idea.
If you have a training video, it's good.
But we'll take security measures there, and we'll take security measures at the 8th stop.
We'll use the available resources and do the best we can.
I'm not going to worry too much about this.
We have a plan."

The face book will perform actual checks and fight false news.
On Thursday, the facebook announced that more potentially malicious articles would be sent to third-party testing agencies and show the results below the back.
In its statement on its website, the face-to-face company indicated that the face-to-face will start using updated machines to study possible drawbacks and send them to the verifiers and may show the results of actual verifications under the back of the cover.
Facebooks were criticized as one of the main sources of so-called false news, and many felt that the face book affected the US Presidential election in 2016.
This issue was also a major political issue in Europe, which had led to widespread corruption in false history before the May elections of the President of France, and Germany had adopted support for the sanctions plan before the September elections and would have been punished if the social media network could not eliminate hatred in time.
In a separate statement from Germany on Thursday, Facebook indicated that a new fact-finding test was under way in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
In a blog, the author of the face-to-face information, Lisa Suu, said: "In addition to seeing what stories have been questioned by third-party verifiers, there is a need for more background to help them make a wise decision on what they read and share.
She added that the face book would continue to test its "relevant article" function and to make other changes to its information in order to reduce false information.
Create a map: The story of England's castle
Recently, small Scotney City became the capital of a series of music videos and once as a refuge for Mrs. Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s.
But Scotney's 700-year-old motion history was seen in a suitable location in the Beckle River, Kent, and now it became a source of inspiration, written by Jamie Rhodes (a special love for the history document, with a long-standing Yorkman).
"You can see the signs of the ancient 300 years ago, and I find this so beautiful," he said straightly.
"What kind of person it is that makes this belief fall in my hand."
Over the Middle Ages until the time of Edwards, "An English castle" had been recorded by families living in Scotland, each with different stories, such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book in the original file: he also wrote "the teeth and other stories of the 2014 death", a book published by the British Library, a work that he was subjected to infuriation by an uncontrollable creation.
He said: "It is impossible to force my writing to take effect at the moment I see the fingerprints left behind by the letter, which was written by a double agent working for the 18th century for Yabbe. "
"That's his finger!
And the message has always felt like a piece of smoke, because then you need some light.
For us 300 years later, this smell makes people feel like they're with us.
Oh, I like the text of the file!"
For those who are driven by old newspapers, it seems great to have the support of the British National Commission on Trust and Arts and lived in the city for nearly four months (the "actually, my time is short"), and simply not believing it is true.
Rose spent several days visiting Victoria's "new" castle, refurbishing the archives, studying many of the treasures and toys of the garden, such as the dog hanging on the wall, and the bottles of several centuries in the wall.
He walked on the ground and wasteland of old castles, chatting with fans, gardening, and sometimes painting artists in his book.
And then at night, he'll be "drinking whiskey, then writing."
The history of Scotney's secret history is still unclear, since the British National Trust (National Trust) went into full entry only after the last successor, Elizabeth Hessie died in 2006.
After ten years, when Rose arrived, the staff began to process the file, which he described as "The people of the past century were going to go: "Oh, put it in the building." "
The newspaper, a letter from the British Empire, describes the map of various countries: "You would think the land dispute would be a bit of a joke," Roz says, "but two families would make a big deal of it for a white tree.
Let go, guys!
Some of the stories in the work are starting as a starting point for a wider level of research into the history of Britain, including "The Laborer" (The Laborer), which was directed by a man leaving a new building to attend the 1381 agricultural survey.
The story of "Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex" recorded an explosion in the city in 1380 " , says Rose.
"Agricultural farming begins in that area, and I think it is a good place to start farming.
Maybe there's a connection between these two?"
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as "The Priest" (The Priest), which tells the Darrell family's story of a seven-year period of religious reform during the British Church.
Or The Smuggler, the owner of the story, was 18th-century Private Arthur Darrell, who was thought to have held his funeral with a stone-filled material (the site of his remains was discovered several years later).
"The Darrells" is the most popular Scotney castle family in Rose: "These men seem to be too busy to borrow money and spend more money on things they can't afford.
In the second century, Darrell men were able to solve their debt problems by marrying wealthy women, and I think they should be a wise young man and understand how to pursue women. "
As he finished his assignment in the castle, Rose began looking for other strange writing experiences.
He completed a painting for two weeks in the wilderness of Finland, which was about "El âm ânm âki", a 20th-century early hospital, which was subsequently abandoned.
But Scottney has a special position for him.
"I'm sorry to leave," he said.
"It's like, 'Oh, I have to go face to face in a real life."
According to the news reporters, the head of the Smart Car Team is located on the coast, and the operator is implementing the Deputy Prime Minister's lead for the promotion of communications.
Which of the largest energy companies is the "richest enemy country", so who is the most money in the world?
Yesterday, a well-known PFC energy company issued a high-ranking list of 50 companies on the market in 2011, with US oil natural gas producer Exson with a market value of $40.6 million, followed by China's oil and Dutch royal cards.
In this list of PFCs, medium oil has been questioned twice in 2007 and 2009, and the other year's lead position is occupied by Exson.
Among the 50 strong lists in 2011, there were three companies from within China, in addition to the list of medium-sized oil 2 and the 9th and 15th Chinese sea oil.
According to PFC statistics, however, although current oil prices were far higher than 4 years ago, PFC Energy Company CEO noted that there were many factors that led to a low market value, including the decrease in natural gas prices in North America, and the decline in global stock markets.
According to The New York Times, the temperature increased from 16 days to 19 days since the recontamination of the areas of Kinzene and the surrounding areas, and the North Sea rocks, the pools, and the AQI, 3 out of 3 cities, were "explosive".
U.S. Amendment of the Blue Card
The media called on President Donald Tranpe to launch a new immigration plan to modify the provisions of the Blue Card.
The plan aims to reduce legal migrants to 50,000 persons per year, and temporary labour visas and family visa applications will be subject to stricter restrictions.
The new provision was submitted by the Communist Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in the two Chambers.
The U.S. media called on Tranquo to " This law would reduce poverty, increase wages and save millions of dollars for taxpayers by changing the U.S. distribution of credit cards to other national citizens.
The Act will replace the current programme and reduce the number of migrants.
This new application process is in favour of speaking English, having financial support and having an applicant with a skills-friendly approach to economic development. "

At the same time, a two-stage demonstration of the fuel-fired explosive safety products is conducted by 16-year-old flower companies, which will be held on 29 May and on 29 May, by a new product-assembly-assembly-assembly-exploited.
And referring to the coming year of 2017, he said: "After the end of the tour next year, I want to clean myself up and write more new articles. "
For the environment in the optimization area, construction of the United States of America, recently "636 " Voluntary Service Team " has taken place in "Den Mountain Forests, Preservation Camps" environmental security activities.
The activities not only received support from the Ministry of the Whole of the Ministry of the Interior, but also attracted the Ministry of Retirement, one of the employees and one of those involved in environmental security practices, three-year-olds ' hard work, mining, cleaning waste, and dedicated their own strength to building the "Mélynha" .
This volunteer service activity is designed to protect South-South perspective resources, to promote the concept of volunteer service "to care for others, to care for society, to care for nature" as well as to allow the next generation to accept and distribute voluntary services from small to small.
Since the establishment of the "636 " Voluntary Service Team this year, 16 members of the Joint Development Group have been involved in the development of a series of voluntary services activities such as tobacco and tobacco, as well as the promotion of energy from the heart.
In the eyes of journalists who regularly reported on the project, the "Cheap" sequence had become the potential of the next Lindan.
According to the Department of Public Information of the Ministry of National Defence, the two Central American parties had a friendly consultation on the success of the transfer of U.S. spacecraft in the South Sea on Wednesday, 20 December.
In recent years there have been armed competitions in the field of human wisdom (AI) such as Hong Kong, Microbes, Amazon and Facebook.
The sex organs are getting excited, but we should be careful.
As soon as you think it's no different in 2017, a new technical development report has been published in the area of sex-eating machines.
Yes.
Now it's a big deal.
Recently, FRR issued a report that looked forward to the development of the next five to ten years.
According to Professor of Engineering and Human Wisdom at Field University and FRR Joint Founder Noel, Shaki, we need to start with the rise of a serious sexual engineer.
Customers can choose the eye color of the machine, the shape of the breast and the type of muscle.
When Shaki released her new report, she said: "People are laughing behind the back, but big companies have actually introduced a lot of sexual admirers, and we'll see more. "
Modern love plants have evolved from the air bubbles into machines, they have their skin, they are warm and warm, and they use human intelligence to produce human sexual reactions.
Users can also "auto-definition" their machines to satisfy their own taste, from the eye color, from the form of milk to the type of ink or color.
But it's even more disturbing that a lot of machines with "personal" will make "repudiation" look forward.
Modern love equipment has evolved into machines with a nylon skin.
For example, RealBotix machines can be self-defined based on what users consider to be attractive, such as shame.
There are also Roxxxxy Gold sexual admirers developed by True Company, who can predetermine their characteristic characteristics, including a slightly decoy of "fractional" and "dangerous-risk" .
"Roxxxy Gold machines have the same personality as you could," True Company website said.
So she loves you, she hates you.
She's got little affection like normal people in those days!
She's a good girl. She's a good girl. She's a good girl. She's a good girl.
The rise of sexual organs has brought a lot of insecurity — not only in exchange for real human relations — but also in the female characteristics of the femininity of breast cancer, as well as in the cold (read as: refusal) of rape on Pharaoh's body.
True Company puts Roxxxy on its website as a threat to men.
The website says, "If there's a threat for a woman, why can't a man have a Roxxxy?"
However, these sexual organs are not a simple charm, nor are they just a sexual attraction.
Their appearances and their growing skills point to more darker and deeper parts of our culture: fleeing from perfect gender equality and going to the ministry to add to the choice of sex.
Of course, most men do not have sexual anesthesiologists, and although FRR notes that sexual anesthetists are increasingly welcome, they are still at the edge of consumer culture.
But things that come from across borders can give us insight into the process of our time.
Many people were not prejudiced or aggressive until the free market gave them the opportunity to become such.
These specific sexual organs are at a time when the rights of a global woman are threatened, and there is another presidential lie about sexual violence against women, which is not consistent.
The television drama "the story of women" is not the most impressive part of a person's life, it's not the real face, it's not the body with the body, it's not the eyes of both of them that are buried, but it's the very real idea.
The Republic of Chile is a leap, but it doesn't seem far away.
The aim of these sexual educators is to create as much as possible the body of the most real woman as possible (even though it is the proportion of sexual stars).
The Creator of these machines wants them to have human touch and to model real human activity.
But frankly, their "personality" cannot represent real women.
They can't break up or leave.
They have no assistance agencies or follow-up stories, no independence at all, and no full-fledged idea of slavery.
In other words, they're loving slaves.
Or according to the 2017 regular statement:
"The Long City" has been described in ancient times as a story of a Chinese superpower protecting humanity and a long war against the wild beast of death in the ancient city of the name of the world.
The last part of the fourth season of "Runaway Brothers" has been recorded, "The Chief of Men's" received on May 30th, and the "School" in the "School" in the "School" to "School" in the "School" in the "School" and "Study" in the "School" in the "School" and "Student" in the "Study" and "Smoking" in the "Smoking" of the "Smoking Man", and "Smoking" in the "Smoking" and "Smoking" in the "Stolent", which is more than the impression of the audience.
"The same thing I'm not going to do, and keep up-to-date."
The great success of Tramp?
Mitt Romney is the most popular film ever made.
The political divisions have led to two extreme divisions of U.S. voters, and from a micro-spectral point of view, they have destroyed the U.S. family and society.
After Christmas and Thanksgiving, U.S. newspapers are full of fears about how to respond to the vote by the family of the electorate.
We usually think we're doing our best to break our "survival."
Less comments are made about the strength of Tranup to bring the family together.
I mentioned this because of my sister, who lives in Chicago's left-wing country, who has been out of business with our family, and he's coming to New York this week to visit me.
She reminds me that solidarity and mutual opposition can have a powerful effect.
Because of her collaboration with Tranup in the White House, all she knew, including her fellow party relatives who had been in political conflict for decades, now suddenly and unexpectedly stood on the same line of war.
If it's all on the table, it's a good thing, but I'm surprised that, from a broader point of view, it's going to cause serious risks.
Although left-handed people have been subjected to persecution from Tranpus since, he has been the presidential influence that has moved us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trannon, we mean the possibility of anxiety, that one day his excrement might stop.
However, there is a more worrying long-term perspective, which is the relationship between right-wing parties and right-wing parties, which has been contrary to Mr. President's standards before, and is now suddenly seen as a sign of rationality.
I have discovered that I have recently discovered some strange memories of Mitt, a Romani version of the old mansion: that 14 per cent of the taxes paid on the car (but at least we know his tax declaration) are actually too small for these two crimes to be committed against Tranpe.
In the past century, the next joint party candidate needed only to achieve a reasonable level of quantifiable improvement.
When my sister was living in the city, we took her to New York Park, which was the largest railway ride operated by the Central Park Administration in New York, and if you don't need a coffee, these three-dollar tickets are the most expensive for you in this city.
Timma's voice is as large as herrings, and the central wall is designed as a bottle of glass, and all small and animal heads are turned over, and the horror and danger watch her lips, while the music that makes her sound is strange.
The city of too many villages is disappointed: from the perspective of the high walls, the skyline has become too familiar that it cannot provide too much motivation, and the reality of the city has not given rise to a dream.
35 years later, I haven't completely forgotten the day when I found this "Swiss House" was actually not a Swiss House, but a place in the theme bar "Ye Old Swiss Cottage", which I don't remember, but near a border street in northern London.
However, the rotation of the central park continues to be a magical experience for two 2-year-old children, one 11-year-old child, and two 40-year-old girls to attend.
If I can evaluate the rotation of the train, I'll be satisfied with it, but I'm glad no one's asked.
But this week, before I print a credit card, I was asked to conduct a five-star review of my transaction "test".
In the coffee shop on my street corner, it's the same way. You can also choose 15% of the price for the rating, which is to buy on the table.
The effect of such action is not only to reduce the current pace of central transactions but also to bring pressure on service providers to add personal factors to situations that are not necessary.
The poor woman in this hundred store was so sorry for having laughed, and I was tired, and she was awarded five stars by a credit card deal.

Does breast-feeding, breast-feeding and chocolate help alleviate infectious disease (IBD)?
Meat and chocolate may sound like your system's dream.
A new study, however, showed that eating foods of meat-containing protein and dairy products could help alleviate the related symptoms of pathogen patients.
Such maladies have a life-threatening effect on about 130 million Americans and some 300,000 British people, resulting in obesity and fatigue, frequent or bleeding, physical and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at Washington University often recommend that patients avoid access to food and milk products to relieve their symptoms, but researchers find that key protein-square acids help to promote the growth of immune cells, which can enhance the tolerance of the pathogens.
Dr. Marco Colonna explains that the immune cells will patrol the path and ensure that harmful microorganisms that are hidden in food will not penetrate the body.
Balance is maintained between the cells that cause infectious diseases and the cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body and not harming vulnerable organizations of all types.
If the balance is too positive, infectious diseases may occur.
In the experiment, a cell that promotes immunity appeared in a small cell with special bacteria.
To form a cell, the cell needs color oxide (one of the protein components).
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a group of cells (the normal part of the microbiological cell), and a group of cells that can promote sustainable development.
The number of protein proteins absorbed in food increases, and their immune cells increase.
He suggested that the use of the same methods, i.e. the combination of rheumatic acidic acid and rich in fatty acids, could create a more sustainable and less
Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studied an immune cell that enhances endurance when she found a group of studies that had such a small cell, but another group did not give birth.
She suspects that this difference is related to the microorganisms of the small white shark (i.e. normally living in the pathogens, viruses and bacteria) group.
The DNA sequence of the complex cells of the small cell reveals that there are 6 cell groups in the cells with immune cells, but there are no proteins in the cells.
Small whites are fed into non-fertilized environments, so they lack pathogenic microorganisms and cannot produce such immune cells and the presence of pathogens results in immune cells.
To understand how antibiotics affect the immune system, researchers develop pathogens in the fluid and then transfer unsaturated microorganisms to unaccompanied protein cells.
The immune cell develops into a strong and patient cell.
When the activity is eliminated from the fluid, it can prove that the activity component is a sub-product known as oleoic acid-3-ic acid.
The number of these cells increased by approximately 50 per cent after the conversion of the number of color acids in small white cells, but the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same cells that promote endurance, and most of us are on our path.
Whether human beings can develop a cell that is genetically related to colorectoric acid from the pathogens, as in the experience, but is not yet known, genetic defects have been detected in patients with pathogenic hepatitis.
She said, "The development of these cells may be the result we want to get, because these cells can control the reaction of the immune system.
It can be said that the high-level colouring acids that exist in the pathogens may lead to an increase in the number of these strains.

"He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and the way of thinking -- he's thinking about football," Murinoo said.
"We'll help him get ready as soon as possible."

As the latest 054A protection shelters were built at the end of 2017, the 054A protection shelters had been built more than 29 highs, and the total number of protection shelters had been in close proximity to the 053H series, and the construction of the first 054A subwater for the first 054A to date for 12 years, even in the world, the construction of such a large number of high-quality protective protections, with the exception of China, is only possible for the United States in the last 7th century.
And why the construction of so many054A is so simple, that is practical and useful, and it is worth supplementing the many years of sea forces.
054A has been awarded a higher sexual price and good fighting force for years by the Chinese Navy, with a total of approximately 4,000 tons of drinking water, including a 76-mm tank headload, 32-pound and 8-pound-soil-fired launching systems, 8-pounds and a vertical-9-hilton engine, although it began to build and was more early in 2006, but its time of design is not too bad until now, and the level of protection in the world is also reached.
However, this is a very large gap between its power system and its electronic radar equipment and the current world's main protective shield, as Europe's same type of protection has already made full power progress, and small multifunctional control of Farreda has also been achieved in the case of large-scale helicopters.
So it says how China's new protection should develop, which is directly related to its future position and strategic approach to our Chinese Navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy must be entirely a blue-water army, and the future must be a move towards the oceans, with rapid deployment of areas of interest-related concern in China, demonstrating the presence of forces and, where necessary, having the strength to fight to ensure that China's sharp interests in the region are not undermined, so it seems that the new wave of floods will face major diversification and distant development.
Looking again at the situation of new protection shields in the future series of China's Navy, the future Chinese Navy should meet like the United States Navy, with the exception of the necessary nearby coastal guard belts, other superpowers will form a fleet of fighters or two combatants, as necessary.
The role of the new protection guard in future combatants should be the position of the anti- potential and of the region close to space, and the two attacks should be of the protection group, which requires that the new protection guard must have strong anti- potential and good medium-sized regional airspace capacity, on the basis of such needs.
On the basis of the above-mentioned position, large-scale projections can be seen as a major example of the protection of future motherhood.
Firstly, there will be a significant increase in the amount of water in relation to the current 054A protection system, which will estimate the amount of new protection water will reach approximately 5,000-6000 tonnes; the power system will use an integrated power advance system with a QC280 to improve fuel engines and two oil engines, the highest speed is expected to reach about 30 sections, and the increased intensity of the aircraft; with regard to the installation of 76 mm tanks and 1130 nearby defenses, an increase in the number of 10 red shells, the latter should have a 32-48-pound upgrade and the total number of fish eight-pound launch systems, which should be included in the rear part of the eight-16-pound launch systems; the engine and the terminal platform would also be able to move up to two 10-pneutrons and contain a four-ply-phade systems; and a four-ranged base-range system for the use of the high-range-range system.
Such a new level of protection would reach a current global standard, even if it was not much more than the United States' FFG.
Of course, the concept mentioned above is only the notion of a new type of protection for national property, and it is precisely how we can wait until the new type of protection falls down and let us look forward together.

In recent years, my city has encouraged companies to participate actively in countries, industry standards and regional group standards, to give $300 million to enterprises that are owner-made or participating in the development of the standards of group-making, and to promote the participation of companies that are certified through the production of paper, which is at the highest level in the province and stimulates the enthusiasm of companies to participate in the target.
In the course of the day, during the production of the Royal Group, the group's heads of health and staff are packing a safety-protection package as a standard for participation in the production of branding groups and are preparing to be sent to the Quality Test Centre.
Just two days ago, the King had adopted the existing audit of the "Court-making" team of certified experts.
It was welcomed that the professional group composed of industrial technology experts and quality certification organizations expressed its appreciation for the quality of the group ' s achievements in the core of self-innovation and agreed that it would become one of the first companies to adopt that standard if the product was tested.
The Royal Group is just a reflection of the standard shift in industry.
My city, along with its collaboration, is also a step forward in the work of brands and brands, which is a group.
Since last year's establishment of the standards for the production of lead-making teams developed by my city's security portals, many new companies have also been actively applying for targets.
In recent years, large amounts of capital have come into view of the market, with the well-known players of the Mingster and the high-paying watership. The producer said that two players in a hot movie had paid nearly a billion dollars, and that it was only two days later that the other games were essentially replaced by their own.
Under the role of the four players, male and female leaders played in different players at the same time, which made it impossible for them to appear at the same time, and forced the team to take the turn to guarantee the cycle.
It was understood that, after returning from the hotel to Beijing, Morris continued to go to the hospital for treatment to ensure that the injury was not continued to deteriorate.

Is China's family debt closer to the United States than it's more terrible to buy houses?
In recent years, what recent changes have been made in the area ' s property policy, and are it not time for the real estate policy to be relaxed?
However, when we are concerned about the prices of property, the macroeconomic constraints, the concerns of the future trends in the real estate market, the " People's Day" reprinted, and the last time we specifically discussed the definition of the "People's Day" comment on the provision of property ownership, and now the "People's Day" paper is a more serious topic than the purchase of houses, is it even if you buy houses?
Today, we're going to talk about more serious issues than housing: credit.
I. A growing debt crisis in China
In addition to the "People's Day Journal" issue of 17 January, comments were published on the award and the pleasure and pleasure of young people," according to data from the paper, the National Financial and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Society of China, the National Institute for Finance and Development, the National Property Liabilities Research Centre, the "Third-Third-Friday Report to China" noted that the population sector continued to increase its trend from 47.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6 per cent in the third quarter and 1.3 per cent in the three-quarters in 2017.
The population sector is larger than its debt in the entire entity ' s economy, and the rate of inflation is faster.
The research concerned showed that the Chinese family’s liability was based on consumer credit in financial institutions, about 2/3 of the population’s liabilities, and about twice of the operational loans.
Among them, the average long-term loans for housing loans amount to around 8 per cent, but from an increase in consumption loans, short-term loans are faster and higher than long-term loans.
In addition, the family debt rate for China is only estimated by the family sector as a total of credit received from financial institutions, while the Chinese family also has a number of civil loans, including loans to relatives and large-scale debt.
In view of such data, there is no objection to the fact that, according to statistics from the Susin Financial Institute, only 3 per cent of Chinese population in 1996 and only 18 per cent in 2008, the population population rate has begun to rise rapidly since 2008 and has doubled to 36.4 per cent over a short period of six years. By 2017, the population rate has risen to 48.6 per cent.
In addition to one data, last May, the Bank had published a cross-9 countries, which approached the survey of nearly a thousand people.
The visit to this report is aimed at young "Millions of Youth" from 9 countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
The report noted that 80, 90 per cent of young people living in China had a high rate of 70 per cent, and that the second foreign leader (46 per cent) was also twice the U.S. indicator (35 per cent).
These data inform us of a very likely problem that is more likely to occur than the purchase of houses, which is more likely to be the largest possible "poisonous cow" in the current phase of China's population.
Second, why is the housing crisis the most serious issue?
As our analysis has shown, although we have been saying China's house prices are higher than those of other countries in the world, it is actually quite high that China's housing has a higher rate than that of other countries in the world, so is it afraid that you will be able to buy a high-valued house with its said house prices, and are you afraid to ask many of your friends now to ask for loans?
We look at the world-wide real estate market, and China's real estate market has not yet faced a major real estate crisis, except for what we said earlier, but the United States' real estate crisis was the origin of the global financial ocean in 2008 before the decade.
The causes of the U.S. real estate crisis are confined to two rooms: the rooms and the premises.
At the time of the gold age of the United States, the real estate company sold the house to a very low group of low-income people in the United States in order to expand its sale, while the real estate market was also a source of prestige in the United States economy, but it was not long before the United States economy had stopped its growth and resulted in a fall in the income of the buyers, leading to a significant drop in household consumption.
However, the situation in the United States was then part of the United States family assets and property assets, and almost all of the United States' low income groups were property assets, while most of the previous 20 per cent high income groups were financial assets, which resulted in a higher debt rate for those who were poorer in the United States.
A serious fact is that these people are all houses bought in a better time of economic growth, so that the money paid for rent is also calculated by their better income, and when the income is low, the pressure on the rental is not only reduced by the fact that some of the underlying loans have become more mobile, so that the issue of the property of these United States households under their bosses is thus gradually becoming a crisis of property.
As a result, there was a decline in the price of the property due to the low cost of the income, which resulted in the bank starting to recover property, after the bank recovered property from the leased owners, resulting in a very low price decrease in the price of the premises in the region, which resulted in a further downturn in the price of the house, a bad turn of the house, when the price fell to a certain extent, and the increasing number of buyers found their house value even lower than their own loans, resulting in more people stopping the repurchasing and causing more damage.
So a huge evil cycle is formed in this way:
"Inconsistencies -- income down -- some people don't pay rent -- banks sell low-cost housing -- more people stop borrowing -- banks sell -- and low-cost and low-cost housing --..."
The problem is not so much, since the constant decline in the price of the house is that it is not your fault if you stop crediting the house after the bank has lost its debt. If the bank has not paid the money you received from the bank yet owes it to you, then you still need to pay for it, simply assume that you bought a set of $600,000, and $2400 million at that time, and when the price of the house falls to only 2 million, you no longer lend the house to the bank, and after the sale of the bank you lost not only your $600,000, but also the debt of the bank, and you still have to pay it.
Thus, under such a vicious cycle, the United States' economic pace has deteriorated and ultimately led to the financial crisis in the United States in 2008.
Thus, the high level of family debt in China reached 46.8 per cent of the current stage is a very need for caution, which is currently seen as or below the developed country level, but the beginning of the issue has begun, and since the beginning of last year, the country has been refocusing on the issue of gambling, a very predictable decision that would have led to a high risk of serious financial risk if the family debt rate were to continue to increase.
Thus, the houses were then used, not to be used, and the countries were more likely to create multimodal supplies, multi-way security, procurement and multi-measures, to further address potential risks.
For our individual families, it must be necessary to give up dwelling investment and to do everything within the time of the purchase of the house to avoid falling into great burdens and only to assess their income and debt levels is a healthy family rich development path.

According to the military records published in the "Time" magazine, last month's White Coliseum decided to transfer a military military helicopter to South-Westphalia for the huge privilege of displaying United States manufacturing and costing up to $24,000.
Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as the Navy Army Force No. 1 when the President met) was an important demonstration of the project building activities in the United States on 17 July.
President Donald Tranpe, Vice-President Michael Jones and High-level officials from all 50 states have been monitoring the production of products.
The exhibition consists of helicopters from the state of Quechua, a bridge in the state of Maine, a fire truck in Wisconsin and a train from the state of Mississippi.
On the basis of the record of the team of military helicopters operating on the helicopter (HMX-1), the White Cross military office requested the helicopter to be present by order of day (FRAGO) only 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the south of the "special" activity.
One day before the event, the HMX-1 commander said in his e-mail to the Air Force Commander ' s Deputy Command " I just want to confirm your knowledge because this activity is of great importance " .
The information indicates that the helicopter will take part in the activities of approximately 7 p.m. on 17 July, at 3 p.m. and will leave after 6 to 9 p.m. on that evening.
The information also indicates that one time delay from the White Sea has been delayed and that the return of the ship due to the time limit for work requires a second group of team members.
The original team members survived at the helicopter during their activities, while the security forces were nearby while the aircraft was on the ground.
The " Time " magazine records did not make it clear whether there was a final need for team II personnel.
The Hague Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record noted that HMX-1 had asked whether this activity had been in violation of the Act.
The commander wrote "One question we ask is whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act, and was informed that there was no violation. "
"It sounds like you're locked up," the Deputy Command replied.
The White House defines this "U.S. production" activity as official activity and therefore is not governed by the "Haki Act".
But even official activities have political colors.
In the event, the President raised the issue of the Senate at the time: medical reform and a great deal of pressure on the rule of government law.
It's no new thing to use military aircraft No. 1 or Air Force One for political propaganda.
All the historical presidents were required to travel to these aircraft.
But it's not unusual to use it for the purposes of photography.
Tranunpur was concerned at the slow pace of the presidential campaign in Melbourne, Florida, in February, and finally stopped his background at his first election, while his promotion account was full of complaints about the use of the former President ' s expertise.
The vice-president of the White Paper, Linse Walters, said that "the White House is no longer active because of the ‘United States’ exhibition, which showed products from all 50 states, which were produced by US workers. "
HMX-1 is often trained by aircraft personnel in the vicinity of Washington and South America, and the President of the United States is placed in White House.
In early July, at the G-20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 was trained 58 times in the White House.
One official stated that this United States manufacturing activity was carried out in the training requirements of the team this month.
The helicopter forces also flew 11 hours of "non-Presidential support" missions that day.
The White House claims that the taxpayer has not incurred any other means of this activity.
Sikorsky said that the company did not participate in the organization's demonstration of South-South helm.
HMX-1 did not retain the budget record of the President ' s flight, so it was very difficult to determine the exact cost of this activity.
However, in accordance with the time spent in the financial year 2017 by the Ministry of Defence, VH-3D can be charged for each flight of $24,380 per hour.
The troop records recorded the time each flight from the base of the FARDC, Virginia.
It is claimed that the cost of operating the helicopter is much lower than that.
Walters stated that "the costs incurred by tax collectors are highly misleading on the basis of the cost of compensation.
These estimates include staff costs, maintenance costs and many others, including unencumbered costs in annual appropriations.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the cost of reimbursement does not include staff costs, but does include oil costs, maintenance costs and contract costs.
At the time, former White Press Speaker Sean Spike used the helicopter for this activity,
"The idea is to show the United States made this week,
And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Conjugation are proud of this, and they have all contributed to our national security, and I guess there are thousands and hundreds of people working on it.
And I feel like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the result of a number of Americans who don't give up.
So it's obvious that this is certainly not an inappropriate time."
We do not know whether Taranup is interacting with the helicopter when traveling south on the activities, but he is actually sitting on the edge of the fire truck.
In the White House, Tranpu spoke to Sikorsky's representative, who took his own company plane and the media with him.
He said, "I know Sikorsky.
