Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years
The international team of biologists has concluded that the most long-lasting call animal is the Greenlandian polar shark, which can live some 500 years.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, which is over five feet [5 m] long, may be 272 to 512 years old.
Biologists believe that low metabolism plays an important role in the long term of sharks, which leads to slow development.
The catch of Greenland sharks is only 150 years old.
Previously, it was thought that far from all callless animals, the "neighbor" of the shark was the Greenland whale.
The oldest person known as a scientist was 210 years old.

Is it going to a sanatorium if there's no problem with it?
Our expert is the chief doctor of the Alga Godus Synatorium.
And if a healthy person just stopped working, should he go to a sanatorium?
Sanitary and curative breathing is needed not only for treatment but also for prevention of diseases.
Under the humane schedule, a person can check his or her body's condition and receive the doctor's recommendations for his life so that his health does not deteriorate.
Such recommendations will not be of any value to anyone.
"Just standing out of work" is an important sign of an organism, which should not be removed.
Constant stress, mental and physical exhaustion can lead to depression and chronic fatigue.
And there are about 90 percent of the people who come in.
He was the most underprivileged of the major cities from 45 to 55 years of age.
So it's better not to make the situation worse and let yourself rest for a while.
Studies show that 98 per cent of people reduce their biological age while living in a classroom.
Today's senators offer comfortable rest for the entire family.
So if you want to take a vacation with your children, you don't have to stay with them.
For children, even the smallest, health programmes include diagnostic services, paediatric advice, analysis and medical care.
For example, swimming (there are many scenarios of children), inhalation, special diets, massages, oxygen cocktails, healing culture.
The course of procedure shall determine doctors, taking into account individual evidence and characteristics of the growing body.
In addition, in the classrooms, children's clubs usually work with animators where children can visit games, different master classes.
Some signatories open their doors even for guests with young people, provide the pregnant women with the necessary conditions and provide services for an experienced nurse.
The mild winters, for years, create a variety of sundials in the year (more than 300), creating good conditions for a round - the - clock rest on the Caucasus Mining Waters.
And then the organism needs rest not only for the flight.
So there is no need to fear windows because most procedures are in the room and nothing depends on the season.
In general, satural and curative treatment is willing to take twice a year, especially for adults.
The capital of the region of the Caucasus Mining Waters, of course, is the treatment of mineral sources: Slavian, Smirnovski, Essentutuki, Narzan.
They have unique properties and affect different systems of the body.
The water varies according to temperature, volume of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor collects water depending on the patient's feelings.
Yes, Narzán has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating activity, restores the functions of the heat-cooling tract and the exchange of substances.
Essenttuki-4 has an impact on the heat and humidity tract, reducing the sugar level.
The “new sensitivities” are counter-inflammation, jealousy and violence.
The same effects also have the water "Slavian".
When water is administered, doctors are obliged to take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it collects less salt water because salt keeps fluids that lead to increased pressure.
The use of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be consumed at a certain time, at the required amount and at a specific temperature.
There are now various space-based procedures for persons and bodies available in the classrooms.
What types of health care based on the natural features of the North Caucasus can be obtained at the resorts of the region?
Close to Pitigorska, for example, there is the Tambukan salt lake, a leach of which is useful for ingredients, callinator, internal organs.
It provides anti-inflammatory, dispersing, immunomodulating action.
These are health gaps on individual routes.
They are particularly popular in Chisolodska, where there is a large Kurt Park (second largest in Europe).
It's popular in Chisolodska, which is close to the Narzan mineral source.
There you can also take vans of wines, vegetables, yoborms, vegetables, chelphine-lacrics, depending on what your doctor will tell you.
I'm going to take over the fruit.
What can I do to make sure I'm out of this season?
He's talking about Julia Bellopuhov, agronom and a daughter.
The high-speed tomatoes are to set up a strip: to pick up the new bags, cut the bags, remove all the leaves to the previous box with fruits and flowers with small ties - they cannot be seen.
All tomatoes, regardless of the "constitution", as well as the pollutant and grounded by a golden superphosphate extract, are processed by biopharmaceuticals (Deutsiver - to speed up the flow and growth of fruits, phytosporin-M, phytolavin, Gamair, Bactophyt - from the disease, immunocytrophytitis - to enhance immunity, Bitoxibicillin, Lepidocide, Phytovarm if they are harmful).
Only milk powder, colloidal cheese and green honey should be used at the end of the summer.
Let's do the last half of the crops.
The dlinopplets in the heat drop off from the fuel so that the lower, flat part of the wood (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, drying hot water and the solution of the Circon, absorbing the level 5-7 cm of the compost.
It is also easy to extend the fruit of the cup: cut the old leaves, pour the hot water and solution of the complex improvement, shake the fruit floor under the chest.
To protect from nighttime colds, place a hole on the edge of a hole with a covering material.
Keep the day of growth open and close after sunset.
End marks.
What shows that Russia is coming out of the crisis?
The economists have seen signs of Russia's departure since the last twenty years of the recession.
According to the Bloomberg analysis agency, the RFF shows a positive dynamic, which decreased by 0.8 per cent per year in the second quarter of GDP.
This indicator has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latter, the fall in the Russian economy in the second quarter was 0.6 per cent.
The Central Bank and the Minécona Development have also recently announced the stabilization of the situation.
Before it's a slow growth.
According to CBR experts, the recession in the Russian economy remained in the past.
"The Russian GDP index assessment says that the recession is behind and ahead is a slow growth of the economy," says the Russian Bank's bulletin "What the trends are talking about."
The modular assessment of GDP in the current district of the regulators increased to 0.4 per cent and the assessment in the fourth quarter was 0.5 per cent.
As the representative of the Minoronomic Development reported, during the second quarter of the IPF dropped by 0.2 per cent in the second quarter.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleared share of GDP was 0.2 per cent of the previous quarter.
However, during the quarter, it fell by 0.2 per cent in April and in May and June the change in GDP was within 0-0.15," quoted by MER RIA as "Newsty".
The slowdown in the pace of the fall in the Russian economy during the last five quarters is evidence that "one passed".
Among other markers indicating the signs of national economic recovery, Bloomberg calls for an increase in demand for electricity and rail transport, business recovery.
If an amendment is made to that year's height, it is understandable that the dynamics plus 1 per cent electricity consumption may be half due to an additional working day.
Add to this lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The following argument is the growth of freight transport, but it is difficult to get accurate data here, and plus 0.5 per cent of the average annual amount can also be explained seasonally," explains Cyril Yavowenko from ALOR BROKER.
There are, however, other more obvious signs of the stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lowering price pressure.
In July the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month of the year.
In addition, Rostat has been thinking of deflation in the last two weeks.
The prices in Russia fell in the first five years.
Looking at the dynamics of the ruble course, which, although shown strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has increased by 12 per cent since August of the year.
It is also one of the indicators of recovery that must be followed by indicators from the real economy sector," Yavwinko stressed.
In addition, since April there has been an increase in industrial production.
In June, the rate grew by 1.7 per cent.
Foreign trade rates are slowed from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
A positive dynamic is also shown in the labour market where unemployment has declined to 5.4 per cent.
It was only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the favourable situation on the labour market, the issue of real income from the population should be left to the better.
The annual figure is reduced by 4.8 per cent.
This factor can aggravate economic recovery as household costs contribute to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the economy is over 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, as risk factors for economic growth, the harsh policies of the Bank of Russia can also be called.
The regulator maintains a 10.5 per cent rate, which is not best affecting the real sector.
The negative factor is also insufficiently high investment, which hinders industrial capacity development.
In general, however, it can be expected that by the end of the year the rate of decline in the RF economy will slow to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015,” said GK Forex Club Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalization of sportsmen, recently launched in the Russian football and experienced in the winter sports in Olympia in Sochi, has not yet developed so actively in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio de Russia and former foreigners are spoken, in most cases it is about the shocks of the former Soviet Union.
So in Rio de Janeiro we can monitor the reverse process -- enough Russians are under the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of civilization is different.
Some parents have moved into another country as a child, leaving no choice.
There was no competition for a place in the Russian Federation.
And someone thought that there would be better conditions for development beyond the border.
Iif.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport of a 27-year-old girl says her name is Lisa Rizigh.
But earlier she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
Over the past four years, as the Soviet Union has only failed, Liza's parents have decided to immigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to go to her older sister’s feet and take a easy toy.
Just like the sister, Lisa picked out a six-year-old.
She'll stay in Russia if she can't "get off the throne" Ellen Isinbaev.
Unfortunately, in Rio Liza, the Olympics will be our only land, even though they were, in the six-year-olds sector.
Its best achievements in this type of sport are the 2010 European champion bronze and the 2009 continent's first prize, which it re-examined in the absence of Elena Isinbaev.
The 29th-year-old Elena Pirožkova was born in Novacusce in 1986.
Her parents were religious preachers of the gospel.
Much because of their faith, they went to the United States when the girl was three years old.
Besides Elena, eight other children were raised in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena started getting into a fight at school.
With good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where another former Russian Vladislav Izbonikov continued to operate at the U.S. Training Centre.
In the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost her first impression.
That's why the champions are at peace in the same year - winning.
Until then, she had succeeded in winning the 2010 World Cup.
Next came the 2013 bronze and September 2014.
Mary was born in the city of Yaroslavla on 26 years of age, where she first became acquainted with modern navigation.
But it would be wrong to say that she was raised by our trainers in Russia.
Soon the family decided to immigrate to the United States and move to Colorado.
There Maria continued her work.
She had recently entered the United States Assembly and had shown great results in the Pan American Games.
It is understandable that, at a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot produce competition, but for America, its indicators are generation.
A new name, which Russian sounds strangely, Christine Shaalbina was 11 years old when her parents decided to continue training a girl in an ocean art gymnastics.
By this time, the girl had taken up any kind of sport in the family of Yaroslav.
Emigrating to the United States, she quickly entered the country ' s Youth Assembly and later returned to the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen wore gold and silver.
The first position on the world scene was, of course, no conflict, but for the United States, it organized this break -- it had taken a star-distance collection at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another one of our former "birth" is she Berezco-Margarander, who speaks for Germany's collection.
She was born in Tolitati.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more prospects of going to a national gathering.
She had recently represented her country in the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, of course, she was able to take only 17 places that were not enough to fall into the final encounters in her personal predominance.
So two years ago, she was able to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games -- young people.
Another gym, just this time Irina Sazonov.
If the migration routes mentioned above can be referred to as standard, the selection of the Irina family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a student of the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland she became a champion country.
It is true that Ira is still training in Russia, especially in order not to lose her skills.
In Rio she wasn't as successful as she wanted.
The best place is 40 in a private pool.
There are very few information about the descendants of Maria Ugolko in the Russian Information Area.
For a very long time Maria has lived and trained in Switzerland.
For a long time, however, it had been under the Russian flag, showing no bad results - even the country's 200-metre-long record of batterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and became a member of the white flag.
In Rio its best statement is 14 places in the 4x100 complex.
To get out of the game, the girl launched a racing project that enabled her to collect some 6,000 francs that allowed her to pay for training in the Olympics.
A 31-year-old free-style fighter, Adam Batirov, played his entire career under the Russian flag.
Meanwhile, Hasaviurta's teacher succeeded in becoming a three-fold example of European champions, Russia's champion, Russian sports master of the international class.
When he stopped falling into our national assembly, it was time to think about changing civilization.
For several years a talented fighter disappeared from sports prizes.
The triumphal return took place at the 2016 Asian Batirov Championship in Bahrain, for which he won the gold medal and received a trip to the Olympics in Rio.
About another ex-Rossian woman, Mikhail Kudinov, the family knows less than even about Swiss Colonel Maria Ogolkov.
It's because his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
That's where Michael started a sports gym.
He had not achieved much at the international level.
In Rio, his best results resulted in 40 positions qualified for parallel bridges.
For New Zealand, however, even the Olympic Games in Sports is already broken.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was nine years old, her family immigrated to Israel.
The girl continued her work on modern navigation, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championship in Berlin, a girl took the sixth place in the modern ship.
In the case of Eugioni Tetelbaum, Anastasia took eight seats.
In the salt programme she was the fifth.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitri Croiter speaks for Israel.
When the boy was six years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
In 2009, Dmitri became a national champion.
In the same year he won the world's youth championship.
A year later Croiter also won the gold of the Young Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to the height of the pillars, Dmitry is engaged in the length and three.
31st-year-old Albert was another teacher in Hasavirt who, following long talks about Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batriva, Albert chose Romania, which would also be represented in Rio.
In Russia he also attended the School of Higher Sports Masters in Krasnoyarska, even becoming a national champion in 2011.
Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow at the age of 28 in the family of the SSR on the volleyball of Yaroslav Antonov.
A year before the birth of the son of Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyballist on the planet.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family remained in the same place and remained in permanent residence.
In 2015, he became a national team model for the European Championship held in the territory of his new family.
Hajiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and died with his family in the worst war ever.
Ten years later, parents decided to immigrate.
Norway had a particular goal, but in this northern country it was not possible to travel to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to learn to fight freely.
He soon won the first peace among the juniors and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio he will be the only representative of France in the fight tournament.
And again the free fight, and again the former Russian.
This time it will be about the formation of the North Ossetia, which immigrated to Spain, of the Times of Freeve.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and is now serving as a collective member of the country.
Indeed, the 30-year-old sportsman has been able to observe high-performance performances in Russia.
He became a bronze example of country champions in 2007 and 2008.
The Constitution of Non-Constitution, Timor-Leste, has decided to change sports citizenship.
The last on our list is the Czech boxer born in 1995 in Dagestan Mahachcale, Arthur Bierslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents moved his family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur began to handle the case under the direction of his older brother.
Arthur has since become a champion of Canada, and in 2012 he has become a champion of peace among young people.
In 2015, Bierslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new family since 1975.

Wife, she has a son.
Why do my kids talk at school?
According to Governor V. Condraiteva, "they say that we need to be re-examined not by actions and paramedics, but by system. "
They must grow up and at least for at least 7 years understand that they must be spoken-in-law and education.
But as long as this job seems to me, it's done formally, and I suspect it's more on the book.
I'll be happy if the classes get everything positive that was collected earlier, at a quality new level.
If we don't know how, the new idea turns out to be true populism.
The CHC continues to remain one of the most criminal sectors of the country ' s economy.
The fund holder is located on funds allocated to the needs of the community from different levels of budgets.
According to the Genocide Office, higher rates are one of the most widespread offences in the area of CCH.
As a result, more than 170 million rubies were paid to consumers in the region.
In the days and the province of Krasundar, the facts of inclusion in unreasoned costs have been found.
The cost of IV-consulting (after cold water) was 4 million rubs for the rental of cars at the market price above.
And such examples on the side of the table.
The people pay the last municipal money that they pay correctly - according to the Ministry of the Red Cross, the average number of payments from the population is 94 per cent.
It is immediately charged with several articles of the Criminal Code: expenditure, legalization of income obtained by criminal means, abuse of powers, etc.
On the basis of the survey, as the head of the fund, which was responsible for the repair of urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, which were not actually carried out but were paid.
Businessmen just gave him a lot of money back.
As a U.K. businessman, Makarov collected money from the people, but the service providers did not pay and they paid for their needs.
As a result of the budget and housing damage, millions of rubles.
Macarov machine scheme, eggs, typical for Russia.
The country had been subjected to a wave of arrests and detentions by UC leaders, who had pledged citizens' money.
In Kamchatka, the trial continued over A. Kohan, also the former Orthodox MP, who was charged with 91.7 million rubs.
According to the survey, in 2012-2013 he established 6 management companies in Elizovo Kamchatsk region and established 3 limited-responsibility societies.
One of them had done some work for the UK, and two others had played the role of accounting centres, which was the money in the population.
However, A. Kohan did not count the money but spent it on himself, my dear.
It's hard enough to judge in the area of JCH.
It's not exciting. It's boring.
And it "helps" in this extremely controversial housing legislation - the Executive Director of the NP “JCH Control” considers Svetlana Revortneva.
We are unable to work out one law as we think of a new one that should be forced to work in the past.
Experts, including judges, are also limited in the case of CFCs.
Lawmakers themselves recognize that the right to housing in the streets is very low.
They also spoke of the refusal to raise criminal cases, as well as in the Genocide.
Less than half of the 3,5 thousand crimes committed in 2015 were committed by the court.
The rest of the investigation took a heavy toll and each five was suspended because of the absence of the accused.
There are often gaps in the functioning of law enforcement bodies.
There is a law, but research bodies will not hesitate to encourage and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, approximately 230 cases of subpoenas were reported, with a total of 60 criminal cases being initiated.
In the five months of the current year, their number has only increased slightly to 99.
What about the falsification of the housing protocol?
This means that changes in household management, financial and other matters will be addressed by owners.
And that means that no normal companies who want to work honestly and not "do" the population can do so on the housing and municipal services market.
There are also small and medium-sized businesses.
First of all, by eliminating corruption as it is in all States, Anton Jarkov, a member of the Committee on Property, was convinced.
And now this work is being carried out.
It's not just one action, it's a targeted course in combating corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a harsh situation.
In particular, in the chair of scandals, it doesn't breathe.
Why does Moscow have no such scandals in the area of JCH, as in many other regions?
Since the capital Government had expressed its will and order, Anatolia, a member of the Gosdom Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, told Anatoly.
I have in mind the question of personnel, legislative amendments and legal education.
The management companies have established port surveillance, and all of them have been licensed.
The complaints of civilians are settled in public space (and housing treatment and response measures are placed at the Government of Moscow's portal).
Many do not just pay monthly allowances, but they carefully observe what is written there as a home.
Awareness among the population about the rights of owners and obligations of resource providers and management organizations is very high.
In addition, Moscow checks the rationale of the rates for housing and community services, since at least part of the budget is for subsidies and benefits for many categories of people.
This is probably all along and explains the peaceful situation in Moscow.
Is it out there? Is everything waiting for the regional authorities?
Could it be that there is no need to change the job?

Can Erdogan renounce friendship with the EU and the United States?
Turkish President Rajep Taipe Erdogan appointed the United States Ultimatum, proposing to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup.
He made a statement in front of his party in Ankara.
Erdogan called on the Americans to give up their support for the "Terrorist fethhullahist organization".
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States calls for changes in its position.
Experts believe that the gap between Turkey and the West is growing and can lead to a new attempt to change authority in the country.
"Soon or later, America makes a choice between Turkey and FETO (Terrorist Federation of Fethhullahists).
Either organizing the conversion of FETO or democratic Turkey.
It has to make this election," the Anatolytic Agency quoted Erdogan, who called in the middle of the evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey has repeatedly, but has been more demanding of the United States to comply with his first request after the strike.
It is recalled that, on the night of 16 July in Turkey, the Turkish army was subjected to an attempt to force a legitimate authority in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of State.
However, after Recep Erdogan spoke to the population, the plague was spread and its organizers and participants were arrested.
Some 8,000 people were suspected of falling into the ranks of teachers and scientists in addition to the war.
According to Rajep Erdogan, their teacher, Féthhollah Guilen, who lives in Pennsylvania, U.S.A., said:
Also, the Erdogan parties have allowed themselves to be mixed up with Americans.
The United States dollars have reviewed all claims in their address by refusing to issue Gullen and recommend changing the tone.
The last statement by the representatives of Gosdepa on this account was made at the time of the visit of Erdogan to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, it does not stop the President of Turkey - it insists on it and also raises requirements for other Western partners.
"Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not refer to the expiry date of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens," said EU Minister Omer Chelik on 9 August.
According to him, the introduction of Ankara's amendments to the anti-terrorist law, as required by the EU, would jeopardise Europe's own security.
We note that on 1 August Germany's Deputy Chancellor Zigmar Gabriell had required Turkey to end the EU's chances of opening the border for migrants to facilitate visa regimes with the EU.
His words were the answer to the relevant statement of the Prime Minister of Turkey, Mévuta Chavushoglu.
Another provocation of Chavashoglu made a minor announcement, allowing Turkey to leave NATO.
The head of the Turkish MID did not exclude the country from the alliance if it did not meet its expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence area is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries working with foreign defence States to import rockets," Chavushoglu said in an interview with Anadol.
According to him, Turkey now needs to establish its own defence system on the basis of its technologies and to cooperate with other countries.
"Turkey has so far tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but we have not met the results, and we have been looking for others," said the Minister.
Experts believe that this is all about the serious differences between Turkey and the West and the country in the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Experts, Eugene Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go into a harsh confrontation with the West.
It is very attached to the West and to the business aspects and to the military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I believe that Erdogan will try to balance with the West with the framework.
Although the Americans would, of course, be able to see on this post a full-fledged human being," the IIF.ru expert explained.
It is not excluded from his statement that the Turkish leader (on non-payment of EU compensation, the demand for visa-free space with Europe and the release of Gulena from the United States) will be given to him.
"Radjep Erdogan deals with the deterioration of relations with America and with the European Union, which will be addressed to it on a humanitarian issue, on dictatorial methods of country administration and so on," Minchenko says.
The Head of the Centre for Political Information, Aleksey Muhin, allows Turkey's President to change his point of view in relation to Russia as soon as it will be useful to him.
Eight months ago Erdogan took a very harsh position against Russia and in all ways sought prosperity in the West.
For a very short time, the situation had changed to the opposite.
The guarantee that the President of Turkey will not change his priorities for some time, no.
I think Erdogan's been in high school.
The two Poles, West and Russia, will try to get the maximum benefit for themselves," Mukhin says.
In his view, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to maintain political authority in the country, and to this end as Russia and its partnership with Vladimir Putin in order to stop supporting the US.
Turkey also needs the EU and the United States to monitor the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
That is why the consensus with Turkey will be reached," the expert believes.
Another point of view is the head of the Asian and Middle East Centre Anna Glazova.
The relations between Turkey and the EU and the United States are now sufficiently strained, and this is primarily linked to the internal policy of Erdogan himself.
I believe that this crisis will deepen in relation to the situation, and in view of this crisis, Turkish leadership will try to re-load policies both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
The President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, is not necessarily saying that they are ready to change their position on a number of Syria-related issues in relation to Israel," IIF. Ru Glazova explained that the next step would be to normalize relations with Egypt.
She said that the policy currently under way by Erdogan was the return to the course of the foreign-political concept that Turkey had followed before the beginning of the Arab revolution.
"That is when Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region.
The very successful visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and Africa have now been made.
This foreign policy vector will therefore be developed and promoted to strengthen Turkey ' s position on both the regional and international levels," the expert believes.
The vote believes that returning to Turkey to previous relations with the EU will be incredibly difficult, now the question of whether the EU will soon begin to respond strongly to Turkey, which can cross the border for migrants and create the most serious problems for Europe.
Young doctors' arrest: Call for new collective protests
The representatives of young doctors called on the trade union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute on a new employment treaty.
The Youth Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is planning to ask its full council to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC says ministers have failed to answer questions about the employment treaty.
The young doctors and medical students voted in July for the abolition of trade under a BMA-associated contract.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC President Ellen McCort said that the Government had continued to "fly silent" about the problems that it had said had led to the abolition of the employment treaty.
She said: "In view of the situation, the JDC leader voted for the rejection of the proposed new employment treaty in full and called for formal renegotiation on all of your issues."
In response to the Government ' s silence, the JDC leader today made an official request to the BMA Council for approval of an ongoing programme for the expansion of collective protests, beginning in early September.
He argued that young doctors had participated in six arrests this year, including the first general arrests in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of BMA's young doctors, Dr. Joan Malavana, withdrew after the vote to cancel agreed terms of employment which BMA recommended.
He told BMA members that the transaction was good, which should be accepted during the meetings before the vote of 54,000 young doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that this employment contract would be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Aliance Plakhich"?
It was the violence that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to wash their hands and declare an official end of eight-month war words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the golded hall of the court in St. Petersburg, I had a lasting impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
It was a handcuff, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's beauties seemed excited, and he could hardly get warm even by his own standards.
In contrast, Rajep Taipe Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "other way" Mr. Putin, five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their level of crisis but even above.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm was supposed to turn back.
But the prolonged hunger from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first one he mentioned in his opening remarks: Turkey was hit by a Russian investigator at the Syrian border.
Moscow's response at the time was inadequate.
Mr. Putin became angry, accusing Ankara of being attacked by Moscow in the back.
The supply was even stronger from the supposed other.
It will be difficult to restore real trust.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
Over the months, media controlled by the State, there has been a grueling, intense attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it was shown that the Turks should be considered responsible for everything.
The most serious allegations were made by senior management representatives that Mr. Erdogan ' s own family was engaged in illegal oil trade in the Syrian region, which was controlled by the Islamic State.
He strongly rejected it.
But in St. Petersburg there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
Finally, this meeting was only due to Mr Putin's apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim victory over its species.
It is clear to Ankara that the benefits of the announcement of peace are well worth it.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he's almost lost his post last month when trying to change.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey were evidently also devastating.
There is also an economic reason.
Russia’s sanctions have been severely imposed, particularly on charter flights that are usually carried by several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast every year.
The number fell by nearly 90%.
With regard to Russia, the Turkish operators and charity companies here, of course, feel relieved when the flights finally come back.
They put on a peak end season on the Mediterranean Sea.
Even this week, public television predicted more efficient fruit and fruit and vegetables than only Turkish agricultural imports would be allowed again.
"Tourists there, fools back here," as reported in the Vetomousta newspaper.
But the visit also had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is evil in the West because she considers it a weak response to the attempt to convert.
Add to this her deep disappointment at the sharp pace of the EU accession talks and Mr. Putin's step, which seeks to use the cold and gradually destroy Turkey's relations with the West.
Finally, the Russian leader won the bonus ball with Ankara for the call to support the elected authorities after a coup attempt.
Note this data for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of changing the regime.
Thus, the summit at this floating court on the seabed allowed Russia and Turkey to present to me that one analyst described me as "a bad alliance": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West unite forces.
However, despite the public demonstration of reconciliation, these two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently taken its position as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing parties.
It may be that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, two presidents had given a press conference, they had not even touched the subject.
Turkey's President had deliberately avoided answers to the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to focus on them.
There is no clear consensus on how they can find the common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility, and taking into account the possibility of a complete disaster when a member of the NATO was attacked by a Russian reactive consumer, it is better that two leaders at least speak again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
Brand RBS shall be assigned to the role of the branch office, according to the Executive Director of the Bank.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to global bank ambitions.
The bank has since moved almost eight years ago, and it had to be saved.
In this period, brand strategies used RBS to protect other consumer credit brands.
It was supported by millions of funds for sponsoring international sport, from Cuba to the Willon Andy Murray Championship.
But now it was decided that it was right to allow more national brands to go out first.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scotlandn clients but will not be run away.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external headquarters and the fund exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the banking service of private individuals who will be more influenced by the Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan interviewed during the client and staff tour in Invernesshire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "The brand RBS will eventually become our investment brand and the one in which our staff will be employed, because we are now becoming more a brand bank."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
Now I'm saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something different in their groups, and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
The RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorial support for Cuba of six nations, and it will increase the profile of various brands in sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to move a brand bank, as we basically (we asked ourselves) how we focus on improving a client bank?" said the Executive Director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we were to say that we are going to be a remarkable bank for customers and we would close all these brands.
But with what we did, focusing on the needs of our clients, not our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can return these brands again, so I think it's time.
Franki Dettori comes to 3,000 winners with a victory in New York City in Prestria
Children break up champagne after a double in Newmarket brings it to 3,000 winnings
Jokei Franki Dettori won his 3,000 British win in Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this publishing note with the help of his second winner at night on his home road in Prestria, taught by John the Lord.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth absentee, which has achieved this outstanding note in the hungry jumps.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Duo Smith, Lestor Piggott, Patto Iddere and Willy Carson.
The three-time no-one champion, Dettory, who once won Ghaiyar, said, "That's something special."
I'm very free because my family's here too.
I'm very glad it happened in New York, just like I lived here 30 years ago.
It's not a big world event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night of 20,000 people.
I'm free from the case and very unprincipled.
Children are adopted by the adjudication when they bring the Presbyterian after the victory
Two missing persons reached the same score in the event of obstacles: no champion Richard Johnson and a retired 20-time champion Sir Antony McCoy, who had more than 4300 winning for a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career winner
France is one of the best in modern times and is no wonder that it has reached that conclusion that so many have reached it.
He's a style and strong, but his tactical smile makes him different from others in the bathroom.
He was a great representative for jumps, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners if it wasn't just missing the exits and big jumps!
And if it's serious, Franki has led the winners to most of the 30 years in Great Britain, which is good to see.
He's an energy person that's good for British jumpers, but he's not amazing.
France Déttori has cleared this publishing note of the company's effort to deal with evil.
From the sharp end to the sharp cuts, Franc Dettori is a symbol of two decades of British smooth jumps.
It was an invasion and a fall.
Many of the big jumpers, including his so-called "The Great Samer" in Ascot in 1996, also survived the plane crash and underwent a disability due to doping.
Three years ago, he began to face difficulties when he returned after six months of disability, but he demonstrated a tremendous strength of will to challenge the sceptics and return to form.
And he probably hasn't finished for some time. Déttori said he'd like to continue participating in the events by at least 50 years of age.
Putin denouncing the head of the administration of Sergey Ivanova
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his head from the administration of Sergey Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of a reliable neighbourhood near Putin for many years.
This 63 year has now been appointed as an environmental and transport representative.
A statement from Cremla states that Putin "has decided to release Ivanov from his duties at the head of the Russian administration," but has not stated the reason.
Mr. Ivanova has been appointed vice-president since 2012, Anton Vino.
Mr. Vino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IGMO) and served in Tokyo.
Later, he was the head of the President ' s Protocol and the Government ' s staff, he reported on the Kremlin website (in Russian).
During his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think that the most important task of the administration is to support your work as Heads of State in the development of draft laws and to monitor how your instructions are implemented.
Putin informed a Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be released from this position and recommended that Vino replace him.
Do they believe in ghosts?
It's a move that won Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has been one of the closest parties to Vladimir Putin and, like him, has served in the Security Council, the KGB.
As the head of the administration he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who showed on public television, two men said that the head of the administration had resigned from his will.
In spite of the camera leaks, however, it has convinced a few here — especially now, directly before the parliamentary elections.
So these are the unforeseen consequences of some kind of power struggle?
Until nobody knows.
But the official statement that a person who once acted as a potential president wanted to run a Russian environmental policy immediately met with great scepticism.
In Putin's comments on the Cremla website, Ivanov said: "It is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very difficult post, even a problem post, for four years.
Well, I've been the head of the President's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov joined the post in December 2011.
He previously worked as Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as well as Mr. Putin.
By the end of 1990, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which was replaced by the KGB, Ivanov was appointed its deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as the third term for Putin would contradict the Constitution.
However, this post was taken by another neighbor of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister until he returned to the presidency after three and a half years.
The star series "Think as a criminal" Thomas Gibson released after the dragons with the prosthesis.
Gibson was a member of the show's summit in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, announced its release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his removal was announced.
There were creative differences of sympathies and differences of opinion.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how personnel of Gibson will be removed from the show followed by FBI agents is expected to be received later, according to statements by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor who had previously played a major role in the Darma and Greg network was in the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love "Thinking as a criminal" and put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," said Gibson in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there by the end, but now it'll be impossible.
I would just like to thank the screenwriters, vendors, actors, our remarkable team, and, most importantly, the best worshippers the show could only dream of.
It was noted that the show would return with its twelfth season on 28 September.
Order: Fishing landed in the Banfa garden
A man from Banfa called for help in identifying fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could have been fish left on the water of death.
Ben, who lives 500 metres from the sea, presented a summary of this growth in Periscopa in hopes that someone would be able to shed light on the occurrence of two thousand fish.
Quinsferri Crossing: The bridge is now connected to Faif
The $1.35 billion project must now be completed by May 2017
The engineers joined the north spring and Queensferry Crossing — which means that the bridge is now connected with Faif.
This is the first of the four combinations between the "Flying Winds" that are now approaching the end of all three pilots of the bridge.
The Pief bridge section is now 600 meters long and is worth 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of concrete and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 pounds of bridge.
The $1.35 billion project must now be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economics Kit Brown visited the area today and was among the first to travel from land to bridge.
He said: "It is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Quinsferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering really epileptic in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete have been used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the gap between the output and the bridge is a virtual operation using extremely accurate assembly permits.
In general, about 79 per cent of the total bridge flight is now on site, and for the last section, concrete coverage is now running out in Rosaite today, which means that everything is completely ready to take place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first drawing on each bridge project is always an important wave.
In this moving project, this relief is the most modern building art.
After the last section of the road section was set up and combined with the growing North Pole, we were then left with the remaining view on the north — or side — of the coast.
This was done by supporting the northern approach of 700 millimetres south.
This was huge and at the same time very excellent operation.
The height is about 6,000 tonnes because the height of 222 metres is about 6000 tonnes and should have been raised on the angle of about 3 per cent.
This is so because the permits on which the team worked were too short — almost a few millimeters in every direction.
Fortunately, it's been a very good time.
Salvation in the Moelfr Valley: Three Men 'Lived to Live'
Three men were 'remained alive' after they were released from a fishing vessel in England.
The rescue station Moelfre RNLI was concerned at 13:20 on Friday, after the command saw the developments in the Moelfr River.
Three men out of all their strength tried to get to a safe place, while their ship continued on its way.
"We saw their ship circled around them and assumed they were stronger," said Moelfre Wins Jones, a rolling lifesaver.
"Alas for us, when we came to the water, and the wind took him away from them," he added.
Two men were saved with the help of a local fishing vessel, and a third of those 60 years old were found helpless and trapped in a fight without a safe shelter.
All of them were taken on board the coastal lifeboat and transported to the rescue station
Johns said: "Three men thrown into the water are bound to be alive and totally harmless.
The ship's engine had an emergency switch, but it somehow disappeared from the man who managed the boat when it broke up.
Someone's been watching these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a decent cure for health and happiness
It's exciting to see how the world changes.
The fact that adolescents and children no longer go to the street to play, preferring to spend their free time watching the screen, has been a source of regret for many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people out of the wild and engages in some physical activity.
The time in the screen was very limited by television, then video games and recent smartphones.
So good to see that technology and street activity are not mutually exclusive.
I, of course, have in mind the increased involvement of Pokémon Go, an application based on personnel originally created for video games in the 1990s (after the series of films, games cards and other responses).
Like many other pop-cultural events, all of this has taken place a little earlier than this new game has become available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The start in other countries was then delayed because of a massive recharge by the server.
In the days considered, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
How does it work?
In two words, smartphone games are going to look for Pokemons that are tracking on GPS and can be 'photographed' (through your cell phone) or 'taken'.
The generation that played in the game, as a youth, joined in a much more attractive way, turning away from the divans for search.
In the United States, the game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps taken by a “normal” person every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which is followed by 35,000 users, recently reported Washington Post that within two days of the start of the game, the number of people followed by 30 minutes of exercise per day has risen from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company does not know who plays in Pokémon Go, but it simply sees primary data on the transition.
Many health campaigns that convince people to "get 30 minutes", "get up from the dead" and "be active every day" have not been answered because most health missions are boring and appear to be unhappy.
However, the importance of physical exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of development by cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to correct weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, too long to be brought here.
But the passage of Pokémon Go is that it pushes people on the street to do what they like.
Thus, there are three health reasons: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even put new friends in the yard.
As usual, there's some dirty stuff they're looking for.
And yes, someone can touch the door.
So what?
It's a break.
Although applications for smartphones, such as Fitbit could have been tracking our physical activity earlier, they didn't give us a way to deal with this game.
The news is coming, and use will slow down over time.
However, Pokemon's success will result in more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good shape and health.

Simon Baills wins the gold of absolute primacy in female gymnastics
Forget about pressure.
Forget about the sum.
Simon Bayles is not vulnerable to all of this.
The dynamic on the resistance.
No need to be on the bridge.
Smelling on the ground.
It's an exciting trip.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnasium was awarded the champion of absolute primacy on Thursday, putting the gap between itself and the rest of the world at a convincing demonstration under the auspices of the Olympics.
Its general ball 62.198 was sufficiently removed from the Serbian medalist and partner on the "Final Peterka" team by Eli Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Ali Mustafin.
Bayles from the United States is speaking at a gymnasium at the end of the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bills became the fourth American woman who won the title of the champion of absolute sovereignty and the fifth general, strengthening his reputation as the best of his generation and, perhaps, where possible.
She broke up when she was shown her final general ball and her long journey to that point ended.
This achievement puts it in the same line as that of very rare bats, such as Michael Phillips, who raised their sports types at new heights:
Bills has spent the last three years in his sport, winning 15 medals of the world's championship, including 10 gold, with such slender programs in their mix of work and accuracy that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called it "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen".
One last test was expected in Brazil, not as much between Bills and the others in this area as between her and the cargo of expectations.
Something less than going back to his family's home in Spring, Texas, with the burning of gold medals would be viewed as an unrealistic expectation.
Simon Bayles from the United States, left, and Eli Reisman are covered after the gold and silver win, respectively, at the end of the women's individual absolute premise on artistic gymnastics at the Summer Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Bills won the first gold on Tuesday, which was a beautiful final agreement for a spring dinner for the coordinator of the National Assembly of Martti Karoli.
While Bills was making it happen that she never looked forward to the future during her long journey to the top, that's not all.
Part of her free exercise program — including her business tour — was set up in Latin America’s music, which would come right on the street just outside the Olympic arena Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was touched by her grandmother and grandmother, beginning to walk with her child and opening up by trainer Amy Burman's mother during a visit to the school where Burman was a trainer, became a force.
She did not miss any summit on absolute sovereignty since 2013 – a field of burden that must continue as long as Bills wants.
Although Mustafin received little benefit from two returns, it was a dream.
The gymnasiums and free exercise — where Bayles defends the name of the campaign of peace — are at stake.
She went up again with 15,433 on the bridge and ended with 15,933 on the ground.
Raisman gently picked it up while they were waiting for the final account — pure formality — and the traces appeared around the glowing blue and blue eye of Bills when the puzzle that she had ever written in the album for a break came true.
Raisman's statement was a small place four years ago when she shared a third place but lost Mustafin's bronze on her tai-brake.
This time the 22-year-old captain of a team that Americans call "babushka" was much ahead.
She sent a funeral funeral following her free exercise covered by the return, which was sometimes mentioned on the subject.
With regard to Bills, the virus tweet from the beginning of this week now has a completely new significance:
Police: 3 victims in the case of a serial killer shot at hearing music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the most deadly attack on the first serial killer of Phoenix in the last decade, sat in the car, talked and listened to music when they were shot, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Leinner, Stephany R. Ellis and daughter Ellis, Malia, were shot on June 12, when their car was parked in the passageway, the authorities said.
The offender made about eight shots from a gun, standing by the passenger side of the car, after which he turned onto another vehicle, is reported in the report.
The police claim that the third murder is not likely to be the result of theft, since the offender has not taken the money or $2,900 available to one of the adults.
The representative of the Phoenix police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that he had fired the investigators to check whether he was related to the four previous attacks.
All seven people were killed and two others were injured by nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas within four months.
"This is happening in the living area ahead of the house," said Howard KPHO, CBS branch at the beginning of this month.
Several vehicles are suspected to have been used, including the 1990's Nissan, the 1990's black BMW and the Cadillac or Lincoln's white.
The followers refused to disclose testimony that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were related to each other and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33 C.E., was hospitalized with injuries and was later terminated.
Linner, 31, and daughter Ellis, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told the police that it was nothing unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a report of the shooting police, which was intended to be an empty pickup for a half-life before the third murder and which they believe was the case of a serial killer.
Followers found needles and pulled a bullet out of the seat and fragments of the pulse from the motor cutter.
The mother of a 6-year-old child with microcephalus: "It's going to be better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixisto likes drinking, toys and, of course, his mom.
But unlike most of their fellow believers, Edmunda is a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Pixivto, did not know at the time of pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn’t do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign it.
What, in fact, is not true, is that you're signing on it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, said that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized medical institution.
"My first answer was, 'I didn't think people would still do that,' explained Pixivto.
Edmund's on his way through the halls.
Edmund didn't sit down and he didn't benefit until three of them were done, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly going through some stages.
He's on his side and he's on the bike.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and drink.
Elizabeth shows the passion that Edmund had for "please kiss me."
"We teach his harsh language," said Pixiveto CBS News.
But it’s not just the common language of gestures, she says that Edmund made his own jokes.
Microcephalia may result in a number of different circumstances: genetics such as Edmunda, infections during pregnancy from such viruses as the cow and Zika.
The symptoms and forecasts may vary considerably.
It's too early to talk about how it's said about the lives of those who are infected with the Zika virus.
Pixive recalls the emotional loss due to an uncertain future.
Did I always say what was going to happen?
What's going on?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't actually ask for a forecast for the rest of my life, because I don't expect someone could really tell me.
But Pixivto has an encouraging advice for the mother of children with birth defects due to Zika.
It'll be better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding is a cause of rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and massive flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, with even more seats expected to fall over the state until the sub-sub-sub-item.
Many rivers in the south-eastern part of Louisiana and South Mississippi have emerged from the coast and are threatened with widespread flooding after extreme numbers of settlements, reports the National Meteorological Service.
Governor Lucian John Bell Edwards stated that government officials were in constant contact with local authorities and assistance had already come into contact with the injured.
Mike Stile, representative of the Office of the Governor for National Security and Preparedness for Emergency Situations, said that high water, ships and sand bags were being requested.
Stile said that only the arrival of Tangjipaho had asked tens of thousands of mice with sand.
The danger of flooding remains in force until Saturday in most of the southern part of Louisiana.
The Meteorium stated in a statement that additional 3-5 dams could be moved into the area.
In southern Alabama, drought was expected to occur until Friday, as rain continued to rise in the area of Mobil.
The Committee's line with Baton Rouge and Emmit's line with Dane Springs, both in Louisiana, was expected to establish a track level record in the past.
Synoptic Alex Krautmann said that the two rivers could cover many houses in the coastal areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flood coming down to Assensan's arrival was a threat, as these airways would slowly sink into the Morpa.
Lake Tikfo, on the southern border of Mississippi in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest ever recorded levels at 9 a.m. on Friday.
The rescuers were still excommunicating people in the areas of Emmet and Wilkinson in the southwestern part of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife, and his passport were among the survivors of Gloster's earlier Friday.
Hansford, 62 years old, says that Bever-Crick's waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, quickly rise at night.
He said that another gang that lives near the border warned him.
"We got tired, and the water kept coming," said Hansford.
She's reached my level.
His wife told Hansford that it was the greatest flood she'd ever seen for 48 years that she lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family were disabled, and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers saved all three with the help of an army truck and delivered them to a fire station in Gloster, where they hid on Friday.
Krautmann says that the claim "fastly spread" continues, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says that one observer on the way to Livingstone reported a 13.75-day drop of rain from midnight until Friday morning.
Crautmann said the soil was overgrown with raindrops from the environment.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets led to the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangjipaho and the abolition of employment in five school districts, the authorities said.
WWL, CBS branch, reports that the adviser to Tangjipahoa told of 200 buried houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, but they are now heated up.
The incoming President, Lord Miller, said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals from high water.
The arrests were opened in the city of Emmett and Hammond to welcome those who were evacuated.
"They will be able to return home as soon as the water starts to disappear," he said.
In Hammond's town of Tangjipaho, about two tenths of the streets were closed because of a high level of water, and sand mice were available to deliver residents in hopes of keeping water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major argument we had was in March," said city manager Lacey Landrum.
It's about to become a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison district, the Head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey reported that the heavy rain continued to flow along the coast of the Mexican Gulf.
According to him, several houses were registered as burnt on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Tousson, director of Shopper Value Foods magazine in Emit, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Tausson, "and she's still flying to the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "resolved with bullets", remains alive after the explosion in Philadelphia.
The police reported that in Philadelphia a six-year-old boy was shot, registering a second shot at a six-year-old in town this week.
The grandmother and grandmother of the child recognized him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandmother and grandmother say, Brown got a lot of firearms injuries, including his nose, leg, hand and life, but he was aware when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He was very well enough, his little body was torn apart by dust," said his grandmother Delores Melendez.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in the hospital in critical condition and has had several operations.
The family told the station that it was expected to be repaired.
He was supposed to be in first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of the four people who were shot in the Germantown district.
Three men were also shot at: two 29 years old and one 32 years old.
It is reported that one of the 29-year-old men was critical; two other victims were registered in a stable state, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot at a 29-year-old in critical condition at the front seat of the car, reports the station.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police were wondering if any of the wounded men could be shot.
Follow-up reports to CBS Philadelphia that it appears to have been a shooting between several armed men.
Thousands of semi-automatic weapons attributed to various examples of semi-automatic weapons have been eliminated.
It seems that this was definitely a long-term battle.
There were needles on the street, on both sides of the tractor.
Therefore, the judge in all, there were several armed fighters there and they were actively involved in the shooting,” reported the police chief of Philadelphia, Anthony Ginaldi.
Many homes and cars in this area were also closed.
There were no arrests, and the police reportedly watched video cameras.
Another six-year-old girl was beaten in the hands of a bad cop on Tuesday when she played before her home in the West Oak Lane area.
It's coming back, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby and Lori?
That's what I call the Women's Olympic Assembly for this year's gymnastics and for several reasons.
First, I was on every summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, three gymnasiums are played in this collective key role: Simon Bayles, Gabby Douglas and Laurent "Lori" Ernandes, who have already inspired so many white girls.
The composition of this collection, supplemented by Eli Reisman, who is Jewish and Madison Koshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
It looks like it's finally like America.
It has also strengthened the black and Latin American female presence at the top of this kind of sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnastics has been an African American.
Last year Simon and Gabby were No. 1 and No.2.
It's powerful.
At the past Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed him.
The world could now be a witness to the three-time World Championships of Simon Bayles, Douglas and Lori Ernandes, which perform unexpected but nevertheless virtual gymnastics exercises.
In the fourth quarter of Simon became the fourth American prize winner of the gold in the women's individual absolute predominance.
And a colleague at the collection office, Ellie Rysman, worked for me.
We'll be witnesses of this kind of sport, but it won't look like this in the gymnasiums all over the country.
Simon, Gabby and Lori all chose the same way as Ellie and Madison to form an Olympic Assembly.
They are "final fifth", because the next Olympic gym will have only four gymnasiums in the team, and this is the last year of Martha Karoli's training.
But, in fact, gymnastics are expensive sports, and beginners are trained in private gyms that support parents who pay the cost of education, accommodation, travel, form, contributions to the events, hotel services (for coaches and their gymnasiums and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnasium clubs are located in rich rural areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where the gymnasiums get everything from their training, and this is a road and long-term responsibility for the gymnasiums.
Amy Burman, coach Simon Bayles, and Maggie Hanni, coach Lori Ernandes, have both trained their athletes since they took up high school.
We must create a more affordable and accessible gymnasium for the countless young girls inspired by Simon, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gym fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnasiums in Gallem for over 15,000 young urban children (mainly black and Latin Americans) and trained national and international seminars.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) in order to provide a high-quality gymnasium for young people who deserve to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnasty develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as sustainability of work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This association has a positive impact on good health, school success and work throughout life.
That's what it's going to be to inspire thousands of girls into gymnasiums, and that's great.
Sports is so important, especially for girls.
Now it's such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simon, Ellie, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of "Women's Force" in winning the command Olympic gold and for encouraging so many girls from different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
The young doctors took the announcement of further arrests following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers hoped to conclude the dispute on change by agreeing to a amended treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt published plans to introduce this treaty, saying that NHS was on "noon Earth" and any subsequent delay would damage staff and patients.
The first young doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in working hours at night and out of time to improve services.
Dr. Ellen Mackot, Chairman of the Youth Doctors Committee " BMA, said last night: "The young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that he is questioning the current crisis of labour and that he cannot apply to all doctors in justice."
All eight weeks have passed before the first group of doctors will be transferred to a new contract, progress needs to be made and time to the end.
The WMA's attempt to settle negotiations was met with a lack of desire to take action and sometimes with full silence by the Government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door was always open.
"Jeremy Hunt should act now, encourage introduction and respond to the threats of young doctors.
If he doesn't do this, young doctors are unbelievably ready to organize the following arrests.
By the end of April, the last item had delayed some 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 medical appointments, while nurses and consultants had been attracted to the replacement of doctors on the picketing line.
The Ministers hoped to end the dispute on change by agreeing to a revised treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants to pay better for 54 000 young doctors under the treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS Employees, urged young doctors not to continue their arrests.
Mortimer stated: "The obstacles are few or nothing but pressure on those who are already working at the command and services, causing anxiety, physical pain and frustration to patients, seats and their families."
For the past two months, we have talked to the Committee of the Young Doctors and, in cooperation with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of caregivers and corporate information policies.
It was hoped that continued positive assistance on other important topics, such as the distribution of staff, the flexibility of training, additional training for those who returned after their retirement, the cost of training, mutual recognition of the training plan, academic leave and gender differences in medical pay, would be a sign of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health met to meet the conditions of the WMA in November, February and May.
Preparation for 2 £ per day may reduce the risk of heart failure
Thousands of patients with cardiac arrest are going to use 2 £ a day after the authorities have recommended that it be given more people and for a longer time.
Tigrelor is an antiviral preparation that reduces the risk of repeated approaches to people with heart disease.
Preparations are already prescribed for 12 months after heart attack, less risk of insulin or new approach.
The NICE National Health Service of Great Britain has advised its people for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE National Health Service of Great Britain has now advised its people for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs with about 140 000 people in England each year, and a fourth of them has another stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes result from the accumulation of fat in arteries and the formation of blisters.
If the fracture is broken down, this may be the cause of a thrombosis that blockes the access to the heart and causes the heart to move.
And if the drum moves, it can move through the flow of blood and block the blood vessels into the brain, causing the insulin.
People who have already reached one approach are at greater risk of getting another one.
The Tikagrel produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilice reduces the risk of causing a drop in risk.
The NICE project, published today, recommends that people give 90 mg of thigrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg of aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: "In spite of the existence of effective secondary prevention methods, about four people who have already had cardiac access, there is another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating effects."
The fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that tacigrelor, in conjunction with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of follow-up heart attacks and strokes to people who have already had heart attacks.
We are pleased to have the opportunity to increase the treatment options available to thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the effectiveness and safety of the tigerrellor — particularly the risk of bleeding — has been limited for three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment longer.
The culture of ownership of PC allows for the falsification of voting in Muslim areas
Ex-Mer Tauer Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year because of corruption, serving as an interpreter of the Government ' s report
The culture of political correctness has led to the blinding of the fact that there has been a widespread falsification of voting in Muslim communities, based on information from the corrupt report of the Government that has been published today.
Former Prime Minister Mr. Eric Picles has been criticized by police, electoral observers and city administration for ignoring the testimony of electoral violations due to “extreme sensitivity to racial identity and religion”.
The former Secretary of the local community, now the anti-corruption king, reported that the threat of religious land voters was so strong that the police had to be allowed to stand outside the electoral sites in order to protect vulnerable voters.
He suggests that voters take personal evidence to prove who they are when they vote.
At this point, voters should only indicate their names and addresses.
The report even proposes to place unscathed blacks on people's hands when they hand over their ballots in order to exclude someone from voting twice.
It is necessary to provide better protection to informants, Sir Eric said.
It calls for increased access to local Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is done not only to protect against fraud at elections, but also to protect the local government from the more open culture of corruption and financial fraud coming from its hands on it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Dajul-Strit as a result of a vote in Tauer Hamlets in East London.
Last year, the Special Court on Elections decided that Mr. Luftur Rahman should have been removed from office in connection with a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rakhman “synically expressed” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and held back his criticisms by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rakhman, as it was said, "He went to his campaign based on the duty of Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes have raised doubts or have been the result of personnel when they vote, representing someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular concerns about fraud by e-mail, in which older members of the Muslim community, as reported, had pressured people to vote for their elected candidate.
Sir Eric, on the photograph, made several recommendations for the cleaning of the voting system, including the requirement to provide evidence of your identity to prove who you are
The report states: “The evidence of pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, was presented to vote in favour of older people, especially in the communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
"There were fears that... public institutions had closed their eyes to such conduct because of the excessive sensitivity of "political justice" to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric has made 50 recommendations for cleaning the system, including the removal of political activists from work with post-voting ballots to stop the "collection of the polls".
The report also calls for intensive checks on registration to prevent the use of a list of voters for amnesty with immigration and privileges.
The option is considered to require voters to provide evidence of identity before the vote.
Use the blacks on people's fingers, as long as they blow their wallets to prevent anyone from voting twice.
To conduct systematic checks on the nationality of persons in order to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Enter a three-year limit on applications for automatic mail vote.
Remove political participants from work with completed ordinary votes and convertibles by post.
The police are empowered to set up orbits around the electoral sites.
Amendment of the Act in order to facilitate the prosecution of intimidation under the 1983 People ' s Act.
Unlawful photographing at the electoral sites.
To require that only English be used in electoral locations (except Wales).
Enforce training in order to ensure that the staff are forced to go to a single bunk.
Sir Eric is seriously attacking the city police, saying that it is "empty", that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tauir Hamlets case.
“The Court, which dealt with electoral issues, disqualified Lutfura Rahman and his agent for a long list of acts of corruption and illegality”, he reported.
He was found guilty of a lack of reasonable doubt — a criminal standard of evidence — on a number of grounds.
It also criticises the unsolicited “inspection of the Galocian” electoral registers of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: " Last year's court ruling in Tauer Hamlets was a warning signal.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of parliamentary elections, yet the concern and hidden distribution of electoral fraud and the status of rejection by some bodies threaten this good reputation.
Similar to the idea of Keet's bicycle analogue and other Olympics in Rio
The 2016 Olympic Fantas in Rio this week came to mind the French passenger Paul Ferran-Prevo, who, as it turned out, appeared to be an impressive look like the Cambridgeer.
But the 24-year-old Olympics aren't the only sportsmen fighting for the gold this year, which can be admired by their own well-known double — at least according to reports in the series.
So, in honour of the Rio Games and all the famous people on our screens at the moment, F.C. has compiled a list of Olympics that have more than a surface match with the Hollywood stars.
Othok and Volk: A member of the U.S. Men's team of battalion Bride Ellison, left, compared with Leonardo Dicapreo since he was a kid
In addition to Kate's double on the road, many people have been able to point out how a certain train could be close to Leonardo DiCaproo.
A member of the U.S. team of volunteers, Brady Ellison, became the cause of hurricanes in Twitter after the images of him, who looked like a star of Volka and Wallstrit.
And in fact, the doctor knew of the foolishness of the soxes and admitted that he had heard that he was like Leo since he was a kid.
"I don't personally see a great look, it may be, except for the plant on the face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
In one of London's most popular comparisons, there will no doubt be more in this year: the apparent similarity between British poet Greg Deserford and popular actor Nilo Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Ali Mustafin, with her big expressive eyes, says, is an accurate copy of the Cuban-American song of Gloria Stefan.
And in the Basin South African capital, Cameron Van der Burga has been compared to the star of Man Matthew Morrison for many years.
Switching to the most unexpected: This user thinks Nathan is the "Sport version" of the "Start" actor
Another long-standing comparison was between the Tennisist Raphael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who could be admired by similar heavy loads and losses.
A silver medalist from Russia, Julia Efimova, may not only be praised with the same burned skin and bright hair as AnnaLinn McCord's actress, while Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team, according to fans, is like "the sport version of Joseph Gordon Levitta".
Heavy women: The Hoop Solo, left, and the actress Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, on the right, have the same shapes of faces and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the match
Building theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the same appearance of this couple
One Twitter user recently visited the site to find out what "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical".
In fact, the U.S. football star and the Dexter actress have incredibly similar shapes of face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her dress, which was close to the identity of the actress Lori Linni, as well as the precious gold medal of Gabby Douglas, which could be admired by its own beautiful wide bead, which resembles the gold of the "Accommodating Success" star Gabriel Union.
Olympia's comment on CBC is sorry about the Chinese "died like a pig"
An analysis of Byron McDonald's fourth place at the end of 14th-year-old Ay Janhanh on a female platform with 4h200 m in the middle of CBC's direct crossing of the Olympics
The Canadian intelligence company CBC was obliged to apologize after one of its commentators said that 14-year-old Chinese filmmakers "started like a fire" and "died like a pig" in time.
Commentary Byron McDonald believed that his microphone was off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final female stage of 4h200 m free-style.
It could have been heard how McDonald, who was attracted to the CBC's team of commentators to "get out of it," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese has fired a sword, child."
Too loose, she started like a bear, she died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
China’s 14 - year - old Ay Yanhan, who had undergone the second stage of ethtafeat at 1:57.79 — at 1.61 seconds later than Canada’s Taylor Rock, has allowed Canadians to withdraw from China.
All over Canada, viewers responded quickly to the network after it was hit by a tone and used expressions
Emmet Macfarlein tweeted: "Is it really the CBC dictator who just said that a 14-year-old hunter from China died like a pig?"
This idiot didn't realize that they were still in hell.
"This little 14-year-old Chinese man has fired his sword, kid," said Ai Janhan from China at the final female stage.
Criticism in Twitter immediately broke down on Byron McDonald, and many called for his release.
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how unfeeling Byron McDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradez, wrote: 'Nothing to myself #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us like a racist bitch. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter Scott Russell, who handed over CBC, apologized in the immediate ephere for the comments of McDonald, saying: 'We apologize for the comments made on the speech about the evaporation in the Efer.'
It was a poor choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
The SVS concluded that more than 90 people had complained in response to this statement.
A friend of the commentator, Scott Russell, had to apologize from McDonald
CBC then copied and sent their apologys to more than 90 other Twitter users who appealed to McDonald's comments.
The telesthenes were also quick to apologize and make a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to go into the Effair.
Yesterday evening we acted urgently to apologize to our viewers in the immediate ephemeral and our signatories in the rings.
It is clear that the comment made by Byron refers to the statement of condolences, not to her as a person.
However, this was an inappropriate and failed choice of words, and Byron is very sorry about what he said.
On the fourth day, McDonald apologized in the immediate ephemeral and tried to clarify his comment, saying that he did not think his words understood as a personal assault.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the female stage," he said in the CBC Olympics.
"I spoke about the speech of the rapists, not about her personally."
'It's only natural that no disrespect was understood, and I'm very sorry.'
Buyer Primark hired a woman who had consistently set a low white among the store
The buyers didn't know where to take a look when a woman was forced to exaggerate the trucks on the stage with shops in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she was imitating what she looked like and stopped them and put them back in the field.
She continued her search and, as a result, died four low-whites in the Bouverie Place Trade Center store in Falcon.
The Primark Store of Bouverie Place Trade Center in Falxton, where a woman used triangular tricks before putting them back into the field
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the time in the store, said that after the example of a low-white lawn woman, she "was gone and out of the store without buying anything."
She said, "The people could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the store, she took a couple of shirts from the living room, took off her own shoes and shirts, and gave them to her.
"She didn't try to find a decent place to do it, she just stood there, untidy."
"They all stopped when she took out the trash again, and they obviously didn't like it because she put them back in the field."
She did the same with three other couples before she finally decided that there was nothing here that would please her, she would go out and go.
"It doesn't look like she's worried about who's watching her, or she's thinking about the man who's going to buy those tricks that she's like."
33-year-old Jenny Davidson from Kent said, "How contrary is it to think that someone is going to take home a bus that someone else has already carried and they have not been taken care of?"
It happened on Tuesday.
Davidson added: "I conclude that staff were apparently trying to remove these items from the sale after she left – well and so better."
"I wouldn't want to go home with a new couple of women's shirts and find out that another woman had hired and taken them, and they weren't taken care of."
The representative of Primark reported: "Primmark knows what happened in our store in Folxton on Tuesday, 9 August".
All the goods concerned were taken out of the sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks using blood-maga.
The environment is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Ron Mirraci, the head of the Federation of Crab-Maga in New York to explain how to deal with armed robbery near the distance.
Whether they come before you or behind you, this video will show you how to kill a person with his own weapon.
If they go back, according to Mirachi, the first thing you need to do is to spread it so that you can see the attacker and 'free the line of fire'.
Then you slowly pick up a gun between your thumb and your shoulder, before you hit them in the face with a free stick.
Then follow your knees in peace, and as soon as the attacker loses his pain, you draw a gun out of his hand, keep it in your face and go back and hold the gun on it.
For an armed front, the way to execute the same is to get your body out of the fire, quickly grab the gun and shoot it so that the offender can't shoot.
At the same time, place your weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then turn the gun out of its grip before you go back and aim at it.
Does it sound complicated?
Look at the video to see how this is done by Mirraci.
But remember, the safest way out of any theft, if you're not a master of blood, is to give yours.
Traveller Jan Wright is conducting his own language in Europe's worst crime scene
The British traveler has submitted his immune system and a rheumatic reflex to a serious test, putting some of Europe's most sinister and disgusting places.
The lead author and author of the 51-year-old book on travel from Saffolka has spoken in the euro bank language, the Pikkadil Church Peril, the mouse button on the trip and the Russian public phone to prove the strength of their immune system.
Before any object was taken out, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what it was going into.
But the experiment that should become a film called "Inland Lisoon Traveler Guide", has produced some amazing results.
The idea of hitting the mouse on a journey that thousands of others use may be very disgusting, but in fact there are worse bacteria in the kitchen counter.
During his entire trip to Europe, he talked to doctors and staff about the increase in lung bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing of the cuts brought him no more than a bad taste in his chest.
Reit became known as a test of the strength of her purse, traveling around the world and wearing strange and strange things.
From the public threshold on the ovaries to the unitary button, this task has no doubt tested its immune system.
In the film he filmed, he said: 'From childhood I have been extremely concerned about my health and I've had a lot of stuff in my mouth from the ground, red and dirty water.'
He certainly proved his reputation at the time of the film.
The only thing he rejected was the Russian public toilet.
His test brain demonstrated the value of aluminometer of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison: only the arms fired should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to draw after the value of his luminometer was more than 4,000 units, while the stretched hands showed less than 60.
Rait and Finnish dairy producer Valio filmed a film about a passenger named "Lesun Traveler Guide" showing the number of bacteria in various places, such as the toilet.
In the film he said, "It's close to one of the dumbest things I've ever seen in the bathroom."
There's nothing worse than that!
I'm not going to put anything down because it's boring.
The "Lesun Guide to the Interior Force" was removed along with the Finnish milk producer Valio.
The company provided Raitto Valio Gefilus, which contains oxygen bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help speed up the growth of human bacteria and develop the immune system.
The senior Vice-President of Valio on sugar, juices and new categories of food, Niko Vourenma said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time might explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brain tumor that ended up saying "Let's call Jan."
They claim that interest in the health of the nurse becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to place them in a greater context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the fluid's health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in drinking water is a global phenomenon, and through this documentary, we have been able to provide consumers with more information on it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was film director, added: 'Let's say that I would lose respect for Jana if he had cut off some of the things I asked for, for example, a disgusting Russian toilet that was shown in the film.'
Of course, some things were easy to cut, and some were harsh enough.
I'm glad we've been able to get some of these cuts on our plate.
During a 2015 study conducted by Valio, 84 per cent of respondents associated oxysmolologic bacteria exclusively with the good condition of the stomach and the stomach, and 58 per cent said they used, at least at times, products containing additional oxyslomol bacteria.
The Hullingan family destroyed Saltat, Cornuol's municipal home, after the expulsion
The Hullingan families left their municipal home with $50,000 lost after being threatened by their neighbors.
Tanu Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilkoka, were expelled from their property in Saltas, Cornuol, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forced to rise from the property of real estate, the shocked housing cooperatives discovered that the property was in a state of real estate that required repair.
The walls were left with winding doors, half were opened, the wall was split apart, and the walls were plastered with graphite.
The family is now moving and is expected to live in a private apartment
Donna MacEvoy, a resident of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid she wouldn't save him.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live that way.
There are many things to be brought up because this object of immortality is likely to be known as not very good aspects of Cornuol.
This family enjoys foolish glory, and their name is foolish.
The couple had three children who lived in the state of immutableness from time to time, and the police reported that the terrible kingdom of the family had included street drugs with baseball bats, the threat of residents in nearby areas, the use of drugs, drug trafficking, excessive screams, disputes and riots.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, received an order for antisocial conduct in June.
In a few rooms, which may have been cut down, found an old mustache
Dossier sex in a home where drugs were sold in the past
Neighbors say they saw dragons on the street and called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after they had been granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary travel.
A relief visit was welcomed by neighbors who said that their lives had been turned into the same.
One reported, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived with them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we saw the police here is incredible.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we didn't get used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of Cornwall Housing neighbourhood security team, said the family could not cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years with the police and regularly called the police
The mouse and the old toys were thrown down on the ruins of the municipal home
He added: 'It is a warning that the lessor could not take any responsibility for her and her family's conduct, such as expulsion, is always the last method of action considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, as conduct was limited, and their actions must have been terrible to its observers.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornuol community have done to give us information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that social behavior will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three children lived at home at different times, but he said they all had a little more than 20.
Dead mother left on her sex in one of the burning houses after she was excavated
Local workers will now have to remove the chests of the mouse that surrounds the house
In 2014, the police set up a search in the house and found more than 70 g of copoules, as well as the corresponding assets and $1700 available.
Skeldon was convicted after he confessed himself guilty of possession of class B drugs for delivery.
She said money was paid for her son, Lee Skeledon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After making them homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms have been plastered around the surface.
The police say they will try to expel tenants who are not subject to the rent rules of the premises.
Angela Crou, from the Devon and Cornuol police, said that the expulsion had sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to break the rules.
This is a message for those who fear that they will bear their own burden without blame, and also for those who do wrong."
Crime and antisocial behaviour will never be allowed by the Devon and Cornuol police, who will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal have come to fear when a low-flight military aircraft has hardly touched the beach
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to swim on the beach were terrified of their lives
Aeroplane P-3C Orion Aeroplanes Portugal Aeroplane is incredibly low
Air Force reported that it had carried out a training flight but was not at risk of security
This is the moment when frightened tourists start panicking, while when a low - speed plane jumped over a crowded beach.
A military aircraft is seen on dramatically, flying at a distance from the catchment area of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The airlifters jumped on their feet as soon as they became reasonably concerned about you drivers, but there was no way to see what was moving on their side through the cloud.
The incident occurred yesterday night near the city of Aveiro in Costa Novo.
Daniel Fernández, one of the few fans who published a shocking spring video on social networks, said: "He flew at least twice, and there was a moment when it was shown to be broken."
Nuno Arrosa added, "I used to say, 'I used to do serfing and swear, it felt like I'd fall off the plane.'
Tourists on the Aveiro beach were terrified when the plane appeared from a plane and a passenger at an extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the P-3C Orion aircraft had completed a training flight to detect fishing vessels on the coast and had to leave so low that it was the only way to check them.
The pilot stated that the aircraft was slightly lower than usual because of the lack of visibility caused by the smoke from nearby tropical forests, but the military and air forces claimed that no one was exposed to danger.
In this year, forest fires have affected parts of Portugal, as well as the lives of four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force made a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low in circumstances — heavy cargo and fuel from forest fires that damaged visibility
The aircraft completed the training flight, and the pilot was ordered to discover fishing vessels within the task
The HASSP system has been mandatory for more than a year for the public, but most of the coffee and Peterburg restaurants have not yet introduced it.
Checks are becoming more active, and business is at risk of fines up to 1 million rubles.
The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, in the Russian version of HASP) have been the subject of risk analysis and critical control points for food producers and carriers, as well as public companies in Russia as a member of the Customs Union (TS).
The audits of business by Rospotrebsor in accordance with those standards began in February 2015.
As long as the officials are making fines only for certain violations of the regulation (see “List of documents”).
In general, the failure to comply with the regulation calls for 600 thousand rubles for the first infringement and 1 million rubles for the second.
HASCP as a system that takes into account the risks of food and its prevention in the United States in the 1960s.
Then it's about food security for astronauts.
The system is now being used for all food companies not only in the United States but also in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASP has been operating on TS territory.
The development and implementation of the business system was 4 years (HASP was launched in the TST regime in 2011).
However, businessmen themselves and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of this rule.
We have, unfortunately, long been convinced that the rule applies only to food products and not to restaurants, explained the head of the General Council, Elena Creteley.
Now everyone's trying to get lost.
The waiting time for the return of charity trips to Turkey - late August - began in September.
But they don't call an age-old demand, as their target audience - family with children - is already ready for school, experts notice.
Yesterday, the Alliance of Tourism Agencies sent a letter to the Government asking for the license of tickets.
“For many Russian tourists, the issue of quality and access to maritime rest is unsolved, since most accommodation facilities are already banned until the end of September” noted the authors of the letter and stressed that opening a chartered carriage in August does not necessarily affect a request already made on the Russian maritime product.
As reported in the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Federation of Tourism (RST), if the Russian and Turkish airlines are in a position to agree quickly, it can be expected to resume charter flights in Turkey within a month.
The idea of recapitalisation of charters until no, depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
It is technically possible to fly aircraft in September, even August, if the pilots are operationally establishing programmes and agree with the airlines on ships' needs," says Paul Rumyanev, Deputy Communications Director and International Projects of the North-West Regional RST.
According to him, the possibility of reinstatement is good news, but it is not too much for the market to be forced on the market, since the main purchasers of children and children have already returned from rest and are ready to go to school or take vacations in other countries.
In the baric season, tourists are mainly bought by private travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to breathe spontaneously," said Paul Romans.
"There is a chance in Turkey to attract many tourists if she gets very budget proposals - 50 to 60,000 rubles for two trips because there are people who are looking forward to very cheap trips," says Valeria Rosentel, director general of Optio-Travel.
In another case, it is not right to count on ageing that is the main volume of travel that has already been planned.
Paul also believes that since there is a demand for regular journeys in Turkey, teasing will also be done, but there is no need to wait.
"For Turkey to start teasing now is a rehearsal of the next season," said Paul Romans.
"Opening cards in Turkey is a positive news for the next season," according to Valeria Rubzov.
The tax code provides for exemption from NDFL from compensation payments provided by legislation within the approved rules relating to compensation for damage caused by injury or other health damage.
For workers employed under the working conditions, milk under the established rules is set out in section 222 of the TCF.
At the same time, the rules and terms of reference are laid down by the Order of the Ministry of the Interior of Russia of 16.02.2009 No. 45.
According to this document, the free distribution of milk or other equivalent food products is made by workers on the day of actual employment on the working conditions resulting from the presence of harmful labour factors.
In accordance with the above-mentioned rules, the Russian FIFG concluded in its letter that under paragraph 2 of paragraph 3 of the 217 NK RF, the NFF is exempt from NDFL income from the value of the milk issued to workers on the day of actual employment in work under the Labour Conditions and the conditions approved by the Order of the Russian Ministry of Labour of 16.02.2009 No. 45.
Moscow's Gastroybank is not licensed by the CB.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew a licence for bank operations in the credit organization of the Gastro-BANK Business Bank registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, AOA " GASTROYBANK " carried out a high-risk credit policy related to money-laundering in low-quality assets.
An adequate assessment of the risks taken to the supervisory body and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank ' s assets led to the credit organization ' s basis for implementing anti-banking measures.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in suspicious transit operations.
The bank has appointed a temporary administration until the time of appointment of a competition manager or liquidator.
The authority of the credit institution shall be suspended under federal laws.
AOC "GASTROIBANK" is a participant in the contribution insurance system.
It is recalled that the payment of insurance payments to bank investors, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Act No. 177-FZ, “On the insurance of the contributions of natural persons to the banks of the Russian Federation” is estimated at 100 per cent of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million dollars in total.
Payments, according to the Investment Insurance Agency, shall begin no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the report, on 1 August 2016, 335 positions were held in the IMF Banking System.
London School, which joined the IGIL, died in Syria
Cadiza Sultan, one of three British schools who left London last year to join IGIL, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akungji stated that her family had learned about her death in Rakke, Syria a few weeks ago.
It is expected that it was killed by a Russian Air strike in Rakk, the country ' s group base, as ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died as soon as she planned to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
"It can only be hoped that the only advantage of all of this is to bury and promise to others that this is the risks of going to a zone of military action to convince people to make the same choice at any time," Akungji said.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other schools from eastern London settled on a plane in Turkey and then on a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultans said that she had married IGIL in Syria and had been widow for several months.
Reid says Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the High Court post in the event of election
Democratic leaders in Senate Harry Reid say he is convinced that a democratic candidate in President Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected as President.
The Republicans blocked Garland's approval, and President Barak Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the majority group in Senate, Mitch MacConnell, says that the next President will choose the person who will be able to replace Judge Antonina Skalia of the Supreme Court.
Ride said at the conference on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland "with some degree of confidence".
The representative of Reid later said that he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether she was going to drive Garland out, and she just made assumptions.
He commended Garland and said that Commander Clinton wouldn't want to "break the ship" with a new election.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal in the District of Colombia.
Ridd stated that the Republicans who block the nomination of Garland are the "privileged" and "capitals" of the Republican candidate in President Donald Trampa.
He said that Trap wasn't suitable for the post.
Treats says horotic calendars for 'women as well as men'
The Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellmer to issue in the light of the 2017 calendar, inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of being famous, they are aimed at finding the next generation of model models for their 2017 calendar with dedicated museums.
President Traats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy" is for men.
I'm doing it for women.
Obviously, he thinks the calendar is too.
“We need to return to the demonstration of an eternal and classicalized figure, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and emotionally with these images of the female body,” Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a great art production.
Models can be taken online or on open casinos in Los Angeles and New York.
Mosquitos will be sending memories of unfamiliar Internet stores.
In Moscow, a memory is scheduled to be released, which will tell you how not to become a victim of Internet store.
That's what was reported in the Rosporevnasor, M24.
It is reported that industry experts will prepare a memory that will help citizens to choose the Internet properly and identify possible fraud schemes.
The concept of this brochure includes several sections.
These will be general information and a legal basis, rules on the delivery of goods, ways to protect their legal rights.
The annex will contain recommendations on how to properly make the claim and so on," said the Superintendent.
The memory is still working.
It will then be placed on the Moscow Rospodsor website, and will also be planned to issue a print version and distribute it to the Mosquitos.
The IMD of Russia issued a statement calling the name of the second suspect in the organization of the divergence in Crimea.
Detained persons from Ukraine and Russia who contributed to the preparation of terrorist acts.
Among them are Mr. Evgen Aleksandrovich and Mr. Andrey Romanovic.
“They all give a grateful signal,” says the report.
The former residents of the Portuguese province of Evgen Panov, who had been detained for questioning in the organization of the tracts in Crimea, admitted their guilt for questioning.
The FAS costs Google 438 million rubles.
The Russian Anti-Fraud Service (FAS) has assigned an administrative fine of 438 million rubs to Google's corporation.
"The penalty for Google's company for violating anti-dumping legislation amounted to 438 million rubs.
We hope that the company will implement our decision and pay the penalty in the near future," said FAS Deputy Director Aleksey Docenko.
During the investigation, the FAS found that Google was supplying manufacturers of smartphones sold in the territory of Russia with Google Play applications only provided that other corporate applications were installed on the device.
Among these applications is a search system that should be located on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates 1 p.m. 10 FZ "O protection of competition" (dangerous use of dominant position).
We are confident that compliance with the requirement will allow for the development of competition on the mobile PPO market in Russia, which is beneficial to our consumers.
The Competition Protection Act must be respected by all companies that are produced in the territory of the Russian Federation and transnational corporations, including, " the head of the Office for Communications Control and Information Technologies of the Russian Federation, Elena Zeeva.
The public is suspicious of the agreement of 16 Russian shops.
The New Book Network was executed for selling the book '50 days before I killed myself'.
The "New Book" magazine network has been executed for sale of the book Stees Kramer "50 days before my suicide," reports the city news agency Moscow.
As reported in the Desporetnassee, without clarifying the amount of punishment, the text of the book may be considered as "provable or motivated by the suicidal behaviour of children and adolescents".
The final regional court confirmed the violation of the requirements for the dissemination of information products among children and decided to impose a fine of 49 copies of the printed product arrested by the Administration of Rospodnasor.
The source in the New Book confirmed that it was about Stes Kramer's production.
In March of this year, it was reported that in Moscow's largest bookstores, checks were made on the availability of the book "50 days before my suicide".
It's going to be night in Moscow to remember Ernesta Unknown.
In Moscow, the night will come to remember the sculptor Ernesta Unknown, TASS reports.
The event will be held on 15 August at the Central Literature House.
Unfortunately, not all are able to get along with the Unknown in the United States personally.
It was therefore decided to set up tonight for those who wanted to replace it on their own," said the press of the Russian Jewish Congress.
It was noted there that it was important for the wife of the sculpturer Anna Graham and his friends all over the world.
At night, close friends of the Unknown, including the poet Evgen Evtuschenko, artist Boris Messerer, GMII's president, were invited. Irina Antonova, director of the Russian culture, as well as the minister of Russia Vladimir Medinski, head of the Ministry of Culture of Moscow, Alexander Kibovski, deputy mayor of Moscow Leonid Pechatnikov.
It was previously reported that Ernesta's relatives were planning to have a sculpture panic in New York by 14 August.
The final consumer blamed: Who actually buys plastics?
Only men of mid-years love wine.
And until you've tried to break up the section of comments on gross abuses under the so-called "Nex-MiddleFet Men" section, this approval is derived from actual data.
According to YouGov, so much debate on the return of plastics has been caused by a two-month generation bomb that wants to discover new material rather than by average years.
Those who have recently bought a high-probability album c are from 45 to 54 years of age, according to data.
Moreover, those belonging to the age group 18-24 are at least likely.
It is also not just the act of dating lovers - it is emotionally important: older buyers are more likely to keep their feelings in themselves (56 per cent against 53 per cent) and enjoy unity (69 per cent against 66 per cent).
But are the results of YouGov faithful?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me while I was walking to the center of Soho's live street, in a humble dress and with a loud squeaking before the stop, holding hands and saying something like, "Yes, let's see."
Yeah, let's see.
While Soho’s heart is slowly losing its appetite and excitement — hotels, coffees, papercase shops have now filled buildings that are once occupied by independent sellers — a number of music shops with fantastic specialists remain.
I would probably ask the camera to stay for the next stage, where I am close to the different people in some of these stores and try to assess their age and emotional moods through observation.
I was 55 years old when I left Sister Ray (data base: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data base: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably over 20 years old), in London on Sunday to meet, and spend several hours in stores.
He's a collector, am I asking?
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plastics.
These plastics, described above (he sent me an e-mail picture, I didn't follow him home), are coming along the walls of his guest.
His reason for obtaining such a large number of albums and songs is partly due to his income: he can now buy plastics that he could not afford when they went out and buy items he had sold when he was young and on the streets.
"Many of what I get is the end of the 60s, the beginning of the 70s, things that went up when I had 11 or 12 things I probably was too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plastics, most likely, introverts who like their own company, add: "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
It's my fault.
Ush, who works at Sister Ray for 25 years, also believes that many clients he meets are in line with yourGov profile.
However, he noted a new wave of people influenced by media noise, people who heard about the return and felt the obligation to buy their old plastics.
The courts that I had had saved people from their collection, usually in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their wine to buy compact discs are now selling their compact discs to buy their plastics," he says.
This may explain a bomb among the perpetrators of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of plastics?
Just take a few seconds in the store like Ponica to understand that plastic stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Usa, some older clients, in particular, are underpaid by an unencumbered payment system.
Some lovers of guilt may feel a need for digital peace and prefer to move into a state of familiarity for plastics, items that awaken the memories of youth.
"I think it may sometimes be filling up waste or having material things like your kind of rest," says Uz.
Just like I'm a collector, I have it, and I think that many people have it too.
It's a simple way to get your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the plastic shop.
The ICM question in April showed that almost 50 per cent of the people who bought the wine album last month had not listened to it.
The question also found that 41 per cent of the players were never used, while 7 per cent of those who bought wine did not have a plastic player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably look very challenging, cutting the line with the stock exchanges of Bosnia.
The "Trophy" aspect of rebirth is what Johnny, 42 years old, worked in Sounds of the Universe.
"Someone came recently and said, 'I don't have a plastic player, but I want to buy a radiohead plastic so we can put it to us," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely does.
More making products, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a plastic player."
These are younger people, not older, a little less than twenty, who are just familiar with it.
Fopp, who has now taken almost all the blame, is a lot more different audience when I'm coming.
There are 70 tourists who take pictures of boys and women in middle age.
Although the atmosphere is less unimpeded than the above-mentioned stores — the latest wild beast sex synth and not the jazz improvisation — it is pleasant to see the difference in its customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but a painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish 30 seconds in a row with someone.
Eleanor, 27 years old, walked to Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various plastics available for sale.
She's looking at goods, not spending money.
She doesn't work much, she says, so collecting plastics isn't a very appropriate option.
It's worth it.
Listening to music on a computer or another device is simple, but beauty is..." -- it's loaded into a dream of a love-filled air.
I don't know how to explain it. It's really amazing.
My last stop is a store that, as they say, has contributed to the emergence of a new generation of lovers: City fashions.
While I'm making an illusion that I'm looking at the genitals, I'm looking at a group of girls, every minute collecting around the polaroid camera, before the father and his daughter begin to discuss the purchase of the player Crosley.
The left is a wooden wall built by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Wynnhaus and Flitwood Mac: a mixture of modern style and classics, binding plastics for any medium collection.
No one will look — perhaps because they are simply a decoration, some are so high on the wall that it would not be possible to touch them.
It's this "dangerous wine."
However, given that any interest in these items could mean more money for industry and send several customers to Soho deeper for some time, almost nothing to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the population's share of which is more likely to have more time and money than most of it is the share that spends most of its money on things that grow, as he has done.
But while my conclusions show that youGov is accurate, at least in Soho plastic stores, they do not exclude the existence of a large number of female collectors and lovers who are in reality in plastic shops and online forums.
These people probably work at school or at offices.
But they are obviously not taking place on Thursday morning, passing through the plastic stores in Bervik Street, spilling plastics and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old false leader, who is on the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland’s polar shark — the longest call animal — video
Scientists claim that the Greenland polar shark has the greatest life span on the planet.
Julius Nilsen, who studies these sharks, says that the record has set a alone age from 272 to 512 years and a length of five meters.
The French court rejects the proposal to remove the magazine from the jungle refugee camp
The French court rejected the offer of the Kale authorities to take ten separate shops and restaurants into the jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
In court hearings this week, the Kale authorities indicated that the State should be able to obtain 72 single stores, where people in the camps sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to meet or sell tea for 50 cents (40r) or simple blues for several euros in single restaurants.
The Kale Prefecture stated that these places should be reduced because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they bear fire and health risks.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vitally necessary, stating that free blinds offered by the pro-governmental association and other groups do not provide enough food for increasing numbers in the camp.
They said that separate shops and restaurants often provide blood and free food to those in need.
The Lille Court ruled that there was no legal basis for excluding people operating 72 separate stores, but stated that Kale's prefecture problems were "to be completely understood".
Judge Jean-France Molla said that bakers, coffees and restaurants played a much larger role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely hot conditions".
He said that the areas provided peaceful places for the meetings of refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk was the children's coffee book of Junglei at the camp, which was not working for benefits and offered 200 meals a day, in English and French, and advice on shelter for hundreds of vulnerable minors without being accompanied in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect children's coffee.
The letter sent to the Guardian stated that its closure would be “an accident for these children under the age of eight”.
Two charitable agencies, the Refugee Assistance and L'Auberge des Migrants, assessed on Friday that the number of people in the Jungli camp increased and exceeded 9,000 — the highest in all history — after the rapid increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Microregions libraries invite young people to learn programmes.
This week, libraries will hold meetings on the City Day, the Year of the Russian Film and even on the Day of Physics.
Programmes are focused on children's audiences, so most of them will be in play.
Today, on August 10th, in the real micro-zone, the library No. 2, is invited to the "Grodok My Little" cross.
On 11 August, at the Library of Film No. 1 there will be a final "I live in this city, I know this city".
The same day is a multimedia lecture on "The Lands of the Early Minimatory Judgment".
And in the film book No. 4 in Surajevke, the game program "Film, Film, Film".
On the 14th of August, for a child from the North Microrey Library of Branch No. 3, the game “Physcult” will be held.
Brittany remains on the Serbian branch in Regby-7 after Master Fiji allows them to take gold
The impressive British series in Regbi-7 was set up in a final stop by the Fiji team at the final on Thursday evening when they were completely disintegrated at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.
Fiji has given the master class to control the sword, the dispersion, the drawings, the support of the game, the escape of the lines and the rough force to win the gold — their first Olympic medal of any flower.
The defeat came with little relief in the form of silver — the third in Britain every day — and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tournament on Regby-7, which won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
Boks' disease, 7-5 in a semi-final earlier that day, could have returned to have negative effects on them in the final.
But no matter what, Fiji won the best of 15 people in this form.
This may be some comfort for Britain — but it is unlikely — that at least one Britishman will wear a gold medal tomorrow: Chief coach Fiji - Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimplon.
It was a trip to Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost each game on Adelaide Sevens.
This is where they lost everything.
These attacks will cause pain, but progress will be successful.
The Fijis began hugely, thanks to the fun of British attempts to capture the sword.
It was like moving on a column of buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Colinisau jumped into the corner.
Four minutes at the time, Jerry Tuwa added another to the right flag, which was realized.
12-0 and Great Britain barely touched the sword.
The great attempt to capture Mitchella kept Leon Nakarawa from killing a third man, but it only held Fiji back.
In the seventh minute, Jassa Veremaalua made a right corner tap, and Britain won 17-0.
The punishment added one more after recovery and for hours there were still more minutes... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravo later passed a few more major attempts to capture Britain, and the storm took the line to get the eye.
Implementation resulted in 29-0 interruptions.
It looked as though Fiji was born for the game in Regby-7, while Britain still had a rifle.
That's a big deal.
Great Britain has made mass replacements for half the game, and they've bought a fiscal bomb... for every four minutes that was good by the standards of the first half until Joshua Tuisova passed after several devastating fiscal interactions.
Dan Norton took the British attempt, made a tochdown in the left corner to account for 36-7, but the game has long gone along the way to the South Sea Islands, whose fans have gone off, mixed flags and danced on the tribunes.
It was impossible to find complete joy in Fiji’s approach.
Matta William has decorated a Finnish cake that wasn't needed for decoration, another test in the last seconds.
It sounded like a quaint, and the Fijians were confused, and the Great Britain fell into a zone that was completely driven away.
Earlier that day, Fiji won Japan from 20 to 5 in its semi-finals, while Britain had little to do with South Africa in an intense semi-final of one attempt at each — the different British implementation.
Kyle Brown is leading the box forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great work of foot, broke the line and killed under the balconies in the second half.
The most recent attempt by Marcus Watson, a brother on the 15th side of the command of England, Antony, has won the victory — and in the end, the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning were inspired to win a race against the cancer trainer
There'll be no more gold on these games, and that's what he's talking about.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy peaks in history, Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning found additional value at their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were two men who were wearing a tie, there were three votes in this boat, coach Robin Williams was always looking for the second floor of the Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the British sports annals who had reached such a height.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th inevitable statement, again unprecedented.
What we see is that two shining sportsmen on the surface with elegant lebedas do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
For every gold, the battalion of ready hands contributed to a gradual growing victory that was important and no hand that was more important than the trainer's hands 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer did not know if he would survive until he could see that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had a brain tumor, which is one of the things they can do, and they did.
If they don't, he'll go everywhere.
This could be a pretty bad situation.
It's kind of changing your species for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio linked that he could start treatment in early 2014 in an intersessional, with a permanent break in the schedule if this could be a proper expression in such circumstances as those.
I needed a paycheck, so I needed to fix it quickly.
That was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and played for 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet per second, although they were quite a few steps.
That's how it starts.
The grave itself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
In the following speech after their first victory, they were about Williamse, who spent his nerves in the morning talking more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, captain of the Artillery Department, serving in Afghanistan behind bars, said, "I've been emotionalally upset this week, maybe it's a little bit of a scratch, but it's so much."
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin too.
That was three years of fantasy with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we'd be nobody, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't even ask for a better partner for training or a better trainer.
Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning didn't lose any race in five years.
This pair is a tight rhythm that their competitors have never been able to match.
Even in the last 500 metres, when New Zealand and Denmark's troops began to approach, Stanning and Glover were too much in stock.
We were strong in the phase.
Helen said, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
Now it's very important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do something boring.
We didn't expect fireworks today, we were just hoping we could go well and get out and win this race that we did.
A couple will need a year to decide their future.
The Glover must be at the wedding next month, with her own television investigator Steve Becksholm's conclusion.
Now she just wants to enjoy it for a moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to find out that I became an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so excited.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government has extended the time limit for the destruction of sanctions products
The Government extended until the end of 2017 the period for the destruction of food prohibited from entering Russia.
The relevant decision was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, which was published at the official legal portal.
Embargo was introduced into our country in August 2014 for countries that had imposed anti-virus sanctions on Ukraine.
The ban has subsequently been extended several times, and it is now in force until 31 December 2017.
It is prohibited in Russia to import certain types of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, marine products, fruit, fruit and milk production were prohibited.
The use of food imported into the country into the embargo is taking place in Russia from August 2015.
Only 100 tonnes of prohibited products were withdrawn for the first quarter of 2016.
"Prohibitive" eggs
On Friday, Moscow is waiting for rain and storms.
Atmospheric front will be passed through the capital region, which will provide seats and lower air temperature.
The air temperature is up to 25 degrees Fahrenheit [- 25 ° C].
Yes, on Saturday night there will be short-term rains in Moscow, possible storms and wind strikes up to 15 m/s.
The day is expected to rain with threats and storms up to 12-17 m/s.
Threats are also expected in the Orlov, Kursk and Voronej areas, and Dni.ru reports.
The next working week is low.
The WTO Arbitrary Panel established that Russian imports of paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
Import rates exceed the commitments taken by Russia upon entry into the WTO.
"This is the first case when the WTO has taken a decision against the IMF," says a report on the official organization's website.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the EU did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia's measures were "systematic" or "conclusive".
Russia, in turn, has promised to adapt import consignments to books and refrigerators in the near future.
This is discussed in the report of the Russian Ministries.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to appeal to the World Trade Organization for Russia, which had imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
That is what the Government of Ukraine has said.
In May the Financial Times wrote that the conduct of the United States in resolving disputes in the WTO had undermined the principles of discussion.
Such a statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members because of the refusal of the Americans to approve the second term of Justice Chan Son Hwa of South Korea.
In this regard, Russia will not be able to contact the WTO on Western sanctions against the RF.
The WTO was an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It is now composed of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The President ' s administration changed the leadership
The President of Russia Vladimir Putin appointed the head of his former deputy, Sergey Ivanov Anton Viano.
Vladimir Putin withdrew from the president ' s administration and expressed his hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and Cremla.
In turn, Anton Vino stated at the meeting that he considered the important anti-corruption work he had begun to take place as head of the administration of President Ivanov and promised to cooperate with the Government.
In the past, Emissions had written that the experts considered the situation of Sergei Ivanov ' s resignation from the position of the head of the administration of transparency and understanding and no change in the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that a leader who has worked in the administration of the President for a long time has effectively established the AP.
Instead, the Deputy Head of Administration, Anton Vino, came to know the specific nature of this work.
In Poland they're not going to buy gasproma fuel.
The Polish State Petroleum Company PGNIG does not rule out that within a few years the supply of gas from the RF can become unattractive to it because of the re-incentive to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice-President of the Polish finance company Bouslav Majez.
His word is TASS.
"It may happen that we will not buy gas at all (in "Gasproma"), we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main delivery destinations for us will be East, a commodity from the IPG terminals and Norway," Majec said.
Gasprom is currently in control of gas supplies in Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 had placed nearly 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas at a 30 per cent higher level than in 2015.
The share of Russian gas giants in GGNIG purchases increased to 49.8 per cent compared with 40 per cent earlier.
It is recalled that on 22 July, the Polish Anti-Fraud Service did not agree to the establishment of a joint undertaking "Gasproma" and its European partners on gas pipeline construction "Northern Stream-2".
Earlier this month, Poland had left a request for Gaspromo for 11 billion cubic metres of gas under North Stream-2.
The Vice-President of the Government of Holland, Alexander Medvedev, made this statement.
The North Stream-2 auction will take place in 2017 and the auction will be scheduled for October 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that "Gasprom" had not yet planned to take any action in relation to the intention of the Polish party to withdraw long-term gas contracts from Russia since 2022, the Vice-President of the management company Alexander Medvedev said.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, only Poland increased 42 per cent of its gas purchases from the IMF.
Mr. Gazproma added that the fact that the Polish PGNIG made a statement in the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not yet mean that negotiations will be terminated.
The former Polish company called on the court to achieve a reduction in the purchase price on Russian gas.
Recall that the Government of Poland had informed Peter Niemski that the Polish authorities had decided not to extend the agreement with Gaspromo on gas supply.
The Polish contract with Gazpromo was signed in 1996 and expired in 2022.
In March, the competent Government of Poland on gas and energy infrastructure, Peter Niamsky, stated that his country could refuse to supply heavy fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new natural gas supply terminal that will unite the country with the Norwegian Shelf.
The North River-2 provides for the construction of two lines of marine gas pipeline totalling 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Russia in Germany under the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers around the Ukraine border with Crimea.
This was reported by the first PMM official in Ukraine by Alexander Hugh.
"I can confirm that the media has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, responding to the relevant issue of journalists, referred to RIA News.
According to the OSCE, the situation at the border of Ukraine and Crimea has not been established.
Observers followed three crossings across the Russian-Ukraine border.
The network showed a video of the landing at the Ufy airport of Yak-42, which was located at the edge of the landing area at 400 m and landed on the left wing.
The video was released on the 360.
The CP took place at 4.30 p.m. after Moscow time.
The race from KrasAvia Air Company came from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place where they were not injured.
They only transported the aircraft to the station.
Ufy Airport works in normal mode.
The mandatory DRC's investigation into transport was to explain the reason for the heavy landing of the liner.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gases in the occupied areas of the Syrian city of Alepopo.
All parties to the conflict refuse to use chlorine, but the UN envoy for Syria, Stefan de Mistura, considers the fact that has happened to be irreconcilable.
Such statements resulted in the termination of the third round of inter-Series negotiations to begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN experts initiated a study on reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Alepoo.
The first information on the use of toxic gas, supposedly chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
The opposition then claimed that in the area where the attack had been caused by a Russian military-transport helicopter, the aircraft fired bombs with explosives, but in Moscow these charges were called explosives.
Later, the Ministry of Defence of Russia accused the former opposition group of Harakat Nur al-Din al-Zinki.
Soon it became known that the started toxic gas bombs were two.
This confirmed BBC one of the victims.
"A few minutes later I felt the smell of gas, the start of the tears of my eyes, it became difficult to drink," quote the release of the witness.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of the exhaust gas is confirmed by experts, actions will be considered as war crimes.
The UN Special Envoy for Syria Stefan de Mistura told journalists: "The evidence that this has really happened is very much."
The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Chlorine for Military Purposes (CPC) provides for the inadmissibility of the use of Chlorine for military purposes.
Although all parties to the Syrian conflict refused to use toxic gases, in 2015, human rights defenders focused on 35 cases of the use of the Syrian army's chlorine against “mortal opposition”.
The situation in Al-Alpepo is complicated by the day-to-day shootings in its areas and by the terrorists blocking the exit of the city.
As Reuters submits, the UN expects Russia to establish a “humane pause” in military operations.
The current three-hour regime in the organization is considered “unsufficient to help almost 2 million peaceful citizens who have been caught in the trap”.
Advisor Staffan de Mistura on Humanitarian Affairs Jan Egelan stated that 48 hours of fire would be needed to be delivered to the city to help and evacuate the sick and wounded from there every week.
"We have to send large goods from a column of cargo to a place where roads are practically destroyed and what is left is gone," said Mr. Egelann. "But the Russian delegation confirmed the readiness to sit with us at the table of negotiations."
Consultations in Geneva between the representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humane pause”.
How Russia opened the "humane windows" in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing attack on Aleppo - the second largest Syrian city - Russia announced on 11 August that a three-hour regime would be implemented from Thursday.
The creation of "humane windows" is intended to provide conditions for supply to the city of medicine, food and first-time items.
The decision of the IMF was taken on the basis of the strengthening international pressure on Moscow with a view to returning to military operations and facilitating the renewal of the negotiating process.
As a result of a series of attacks on Thailand's corridors, four people were killed.
Suddenly a few explosions flew south of Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed, 19 injured.
The bomber came to the city of Hua-Hin.
Among the victims were 10 foreigners, four States' citizens, and no Russians were among them.
The responsibility for the incident had not yet been taken by one of the terrorist groups, but the country's MDGs had been quick to claim that Islamists were not involved in it.
Several people have already been detained in the bombing organization.
The local police, the sizes and the specificities of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military-leading country.
The attacks took place at popular tourist resorts, including the Patong beach in Phuket district and the city of Hua-Hin, Trang and Surat-Tani.
Following the arrival of military Hunta in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
By 2016, 14 million people had visited the country, with an increase of 1.5 million in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attack have already been detained, reported by Colonel Krisana Patanacaroen.
While early on the purpose, he added, however, in the country's MDGs, "they are convinced that they are not related to international extremist groups".
Too early to make conclusions, Mr Patanachoen said.
But we know exactly that these incidents are not directly related to any form of terrorism, in fact, local differences, and we are trying to establish the identity of those who have been behind them.
The explosions occurred on the day the Queen of Thailand was born.
The Thai Hunta considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its main priorities, so the incident is almost aimed at it.
According to the Police General Cythic Shisopacharoenrat, the bombs were fired at a distance of half an hour.
They were housed inside trees on live streets filled with tourists' restaurants.
It is well known that one of the four victims has become a Thai girl who is dealing with street gambling.
The identity of the remaining victims is unknown, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Thai Police, four of them are German citizens, three are Dutch nationals, two Italian citizens and Austrian citizens.
The Russians among the victims of the explosion did not report the Rosturisma press service.
Local experts also associated the explosions with the previous 7 August referendum, with 61.4 per cent of the country's population supporting the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by the draft constitution of the war hero.
The voter had to determine whether they supported a system in which the House of Lords had been fully appointed as soldiers and had a significant role in the election of the prime minister of the country.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time at the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Remember, on 22 May 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the command of the commander's army of the country of Praita Chan Ocha.
In this regard, he said, the army had caused an ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military established the National Council of Peace and Orders, introduced the time and censorship, disarmed the protestors and above the House of Parliament.
How Bangkok was in a state of emergency
The Government of Thailand, headed by Prime Minister Yingla Chinawat in January 2014, announced an emergency situation in Bangkok and the capital of the provinces.
The regime lasted 60 days in particular.
As in Bangkok, two explosions occurred.
In January 2014, at the Bangkok Memorial, where one of the main protests took place, two explosions occurred that affected 28 people, five of which were in critical condition.
The explosions were caused by unknown motorcycles.
The authorities have strengthened security measures in the capital and have attracted the military forces to protect demonstrators.
In the dry log, conditions began to develop.
As is known as "E", the Government is proposed to agree on the draft terms of the auction on the Sukhi Log gold location with two key constraints.
The auction is proposed not to allow companies where 25 per cent and more belong to foreigners, and the claimants whose capital will not be at least 25 per cent of the attendance.
The industry did not expect the Government to override the conditions, noting that many games were not at risk of taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministries introduced to the Government a draft arrangement and conditions of auction for the largest unexploded gold settlement in Sukhyo Log, Russia (Irkutsk area, stocks and resources - 130 million units), two sources of "O", known as the situation.
The project introduced in the middle of the evening explains one of them.
In the Ministry, "E" confirmed that the project was submitted to the Government.
The representative of the curative non-use of Vice-President Alexander Chloponin said "O" that the project had not yet been reached on the official's staff.
“The auction may be announced in August, immediately after the Government's departure, and in view of the time limit for the collection of applications of potential participants (at least 45 days) the tender may be held in October”, said Minprorod.
According to the “O” data, two key requirements were retained in the project for potential participants listed in the option to be agreed by ministries and FOIVAs in July (i.e. “E”).
Firstly, there are at least 25 per cent attendance in the claimants' capital.
Second, the refusal to access auctions for foreign investors under the control of foreign investors is based on the understanding of FZ-57 on investment in strategic societies.
According to the two draft articles of the FZ, as already stated on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent and above) are not tax residents of the FF or have double citizenship may not be admitted to the auction.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, as the Suhoy Log refers to the federal base (more than 50 tons of gold).
In the Ministry, it was confirmed that the project "contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies " but refused to comment on details before the Government was available.
The need for participation in the capital of the auction participants was raised by the Irkutsk area, "E" in Minprirod in December 2015 and later confirmed by the Governor of the region of Sergei Levcenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry by his predecessor Sergei Erostenko, "under agreement on investment projects with "Rosteho".
Those who have lobbyed for restrictions on the admission of foreigners, "O" associates don't explain.
"But this is in a spirit of time: not to exercise control in Russia's largest gold settlement on the basis of Western sanctions," the "E", known as the auction, argues.
The Prime Minister Sergey Donski's head said on August 1st that foreigners could "go to the Consortium", if the claimants would attract them "as a financial structure, technological partners".
The " E " partners consider it unlikely that the conditions in the Government would be adjusted.
The main prosecutor of the Suhoy Log in the industry is the Consortium of the largest gold miner of the RF PAO "Paul", son of Suleiman Kerimova Saidu and Rosteha".
As he wrote, in July partners created SL Gold, where Paulus has 51% dollars, in the RT-GR structure, 49%.
In Roosehe, the comments were rejected, in Paulus, that "E", that "is of course interested in this asset" and have all the necessary competences and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and form of our participation will be adopted after the conditions have been announced," added Paulus.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision by the Government of the RF has been addressed by sources "E".
The Russian GV Gold and the Canadian Kinross, which are developing assets in Zukotka, were able to participate in the development of the Sukho logo, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to the data "O", were not interested in the asset.
The head of the Union of Gold Industries of RF Sergey Kashuba in December 2015 assessed "E" investments in Suhoy Log at $2.5-4 billion.
The majority of potential claimants are afraid not only of investment but also of the complexity of the project: they need a serious stock survey and the technology of working with hard-to-work, explain "E" in the industry.
In the pension market, the largest M&A transaction - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" launched the process of combining four sub-controlled NPFs.
As a result, the Gazfund Pensions Fund will create NPFs of approximately 373 billion rubs.
On the initiation of the procedure for the combination of four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "Promagrafund", "After" and "Gazfondon Pensions" - yesterday, the owner of 100% of OOO "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" reported.
“The organization shall be implemented in accordance with the requirements of compliance with the terms and conditions of existing treaties”, the company reported.
The merger is based on the Gazfund Pensions Fund.
As the director of this NPF Oleg Belošic, the pooling of funds has been able to address several challenges: increasing presence geography, focusing on development resources, reducing costs, maintaining best practices for each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the reference period for the end of the consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the GEF "Gazfund Pensions" it will become the biggest game on the OPS market.
According to data from 31 March, the amount of the pooled funds ' pensions exceeded $373 billion.
As reported on the fund website, beneficiaries of their owners - KIT Finance Pension Administrator - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (by sub-control OO 65 per cent) and NPF Gazfund (35 per cent).
However, only a group of competitors had left much later.
Thus, the O1 NPF "The Future" sub-controlled the "Stalfund" at the beginning of the current year.
The combined NPF is currently joining the Uralsib and the Russian Standard.
“Unification in a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to address structural tasks”, notes NPF-Generate Nikolai Sidorov.
The active work on the consolidation of funds since April is also to be carried out in the Saffmar, the European NPF, the DES and the Regional Fund, until the end of the current year.
In 2017 the NPF "Doorie" will join them.
“The pooling of funds will have an effect on increased control over risks, operational processes and costs”, noted the Saffmar Pension Group.
The break in the pool of funds held by the KIT Finance Pension Administrator may be caused for several reasons by experts.
In recent years, NPFs could not buy more than 40 per cent of the infrastructure bonds in which the group was active.
After amendments to the decision of the CB in March of this year on a number of issuers meeting the regulatory requirements, such restrictions are no longer available.
If necessary, it can buy one big game," says the Director of the AKRA Financial Institutions rating team Yuri Nogin.
Several NPF leaders, from vol. 15 on assets for another possible reason, call the division of impact area and as a result the staffing of a single fund that should have been agreed upon by the owners of the group.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavirilenko was not available for comments.
They also did not respond to the "E" request in the "Gazfund" NPF.
While the consolidation of funds is an ongoing and ongoing activity, this decision will be justified on a long-term basis.
As the director of the Pension Partner, Sergei Okolesnov, notes, in the Gazfonda Pension Collections, will allow for the stabilization of the base of other funds of the group.
This will result in better experience of NPF “KIT Finance” and “Promagrofonda” in building different sales of OPS, as well as more modern OP.
The needs for CB processes and NPF frameworks are constantly growing and therefore double the infrastructure of the four funds at the same investment level, the Director of Corporate Ratings, Paul Mitrophynov, considers it inappropriate.
“The effect of the reduction of double functions is a significant reduction in possible costs for the combination,” said Mr. Mitrovanov.
The combined costs of four Sergey Ocolesnow funds are estimated at EUR 30-50 million.
“The cost of the four funds is approximately 400 million rubies per year, while the medium-term budget is actually reduced by two," Mr. Okolesnov said.
In the Russian proca, there was the best Diesneev film "Pit and his dragon".
The beautiful New Zealand species, the popular dragon, the life story and song in the style of the country are enough to re-believe in ancient magic, ELENA CRAVCUN.
A frightened little boy picked up a dragon that became a human child and a gentle bear and a betrayed friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honor of the book of fairy tales, plays with him in the dogonals and sleeps in the mirror.
Six years after it grew up and in a stately relationship, it was no longer different from the other thought-in-law of Maugley.
In this way, Pita and her husband, Bris Dallas Howard, discovered a vengeful wife, while Brigadier Guvina (Carle Urban), her husband's brother, was aggressively mutilated by the forest.
Now she must not only believe in the existence of the dragon but also help save it.
Pete has a short "be human" course in the neighborhood of the idyllic Americans who wear dolls, a moral code in their hearts and are more vulnerable than any advertising.
No person looks or acts too terrible to be hated or feared by the current observer.
Even Gavin, who was exposed to an unusual host of wild animals under his control, was far from being treated unjustly.
A huge smoker has also become quite fearless, with a good blue bulldogue, a winged fly and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon has fun, it bites, it even cries and, unfortunately, doesn't talk, so it's always wanted to starve, so it's quite different from all the famous cinematographic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manoeuvres provides such a high level of emotional involvement that, at the most extreme moments, they suddenly start to steal into three hands, not only small but also adults.
Ox Figley's role as a Pitt, which divides the family and the current one.
And Robert Redford is virtually putting out a canonic witch who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did registrade David Laurie get rid of the fantasticly nice reek of the forgotten drama "Dragon Pitt" in 1977, from the nose to the end of the neck and just remembered the mix of animation and game movies, and made it the most exciting movie this summer?
It's not like the miracle helped.
In his painting of Laurie from the original, he actually took only two things: Pete's orphanage and dragon.
The ship has left musical numbers and most of the strange jokes.
In this good story are the drawings from Bombay, Inoplantian and many other beautiful children's hearts.
Dyney's study continues to expand the 21st century's high-quality series successfully.
Of course, Pit and Dragon aren't as beautiful as the Young People's Book, and it doesn't have an experienced crime as Kate Blanchett did in the role of the games in the new "Snare".
But this naive film is no less successful in building faith in miracles and good traditions.
The keys from the Waldensian lock will get Laurie's director again - for the artistic adaptation of the history of Peter Pene.
The "Pie and his dragon" Tandem by David Loury and Senator Toby Helbrox came into a new ambitious project on an unaccompanied young man's name on James Barry's story.
RBK journalist Alexander Sokolov filed a new charge
Lawyers of RBC Aleksandra Sokolov, accused of the activities of the extremist structure, said that the prosecution had found fault with their defence.
We learned from the investigators yesterday that the prosecutor had made such a statement.
We were scheduled to participate in a court hearing on the subject of limiting access to criminal matters, but the meeting was not yet held and the investigators informed us of the prosecution's submission," said counsel, Oleg Denz.
She said that the prosecution had indicated that the investigators did not qualify for the case and collected material.
The investigators will now have to remove the gaps in the evidence base and present Alexander Sokolov with a new charge.
In either case, another article of the Criminal Code (CPC) will appear or will remain the same, but with other evidence and new evidence, Ms. Denze will explain.
As “O”, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the result had been excluded from the CBC journalist's charge of "progressing the political situation in the face of instability" and "infringing the authority illegally".
Correspondent of "Commersantbosport" ALEXANDR ZILBERT lived a lifetime of Olympics in the Olympic Village, inspected the house of the Russian Parliament, ate at the local table and even performed the WADA test.
Life here doesn't seem to die for a second.
Even at night.
The last start is at midnight, after which the athletes need another half-two hours to return to the Olympic village.
At the same time, villages and villages are being evacuated from the village, as some athletes finish their talks and leave Brazil, while others are only here.
Well, at 7:30 a.m. in one of the temporary tents, the heads of all the Olympic delegations are on fire.
At these meetings we usually discuss some operational domestic issues - the leader of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team Igor Kazivov. - Although the house in which we are located is considered an example, it is one of the first and has been shown to all verifiers, even in this case, to meet some shortcomings.
It's a hot water problem, it's an excuse, it's a unitasam.
We've been fighting for a long time for purity.
At first, no one came to pick up.
And then the clinics came, but they're just trying to get something on the ground, yeah.
They've got their pools, you see some innovations.
Mol, I can't take them humanly.
Let's know these fields are standard laminate!
In general, the client company's changes have been made and now all the OCs.
The Olympian village is such a South Butovo, a tropical region surrounded by one side of the mountains, with some of the most enthusiasts, where water flows.
Well, there is still a two-metre railway stop at which the carers are lost.
All in the village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments located in 31 homes.
On one of the 18th floor buildings is a huge Russian flag – this house is fully dedicated to the needs of our collection.
In view of the small fire at the entrance, it is possible to determine immediately what problems appear to be the most serious for the local team.
At the bottom of the register are two announcements: the printed "Pasaluista, don't throw a book into a toilet!" and from hand to hand "First in a sign.
It's the only thing that's going on in the booklets.
Their happy development contrasts with the headings of the brochure: "The Memory of Infectious Diseases for Those in Rio de Janeiro", "The First Aid in Incineration, Indigenous Body Disorders, Loss of Awareness - Heart and Sleep Reactions", "The First Aid in Warms, Warm Attacks, Transfusions and Blood."
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example: "Infection is accompanied by leukemia and subsequent treatment.
However, not everyone looks forward to a happy outcome.
Of course, there is a medical centre in Russia that is ready at any time to provide qualified assistance to residents of the home, including a weakening and sporty mass.
On the contrary, the med center is the headquarters of our delegation.
With the door, it's an exciting cry, "No matter what, we're winning!"
Well, of course, the words are:
All the arguments are absolutely false!
Only those who are afraid will believe in them.
Let's go down, it's so delicious to win, Russia won't stop, it won't break!
And it is said: "Dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of the Holy Father of Moscow and of all Russian Kirilla, the Olympics of Russia are being provided with spiritual care by Andrey Vladimirovich Alekseev.
You can order a prayer and other requirements on the phone...
In general, there is a centre of meditation and religious services in the rural area for representatives of all conferences.
Well, Russians, they have their own time in a privileged position.
With regard to the cargo of elevators from the ninth stage on the fourth floor, I decided to land on the wooden floor, which is recommended to be used during fire.
And in the dark he was talking about her body.
The court ruled that these were the emergency staff of the new client company.
I believe that at any time they were ready to take a break at the end of the innovative sexes, they decided to set up a quiet time at the cold stages.
On the fourth floor, I attended a meeting with an old famous Vitaly Fedorovic Dubko, the trainer of our Battists, who led them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He willingly agreed to show his rooms to a student who was a champion of Europe by Jan Paul.
It's not a big deal to complain about what's going on with the pressure of the Russian trainer.
Sanuzel's one on four, but that's why he's spacious.
Scaff, of course, funny, out of touch, doesn't call for trust, but there's something you can do.
"No, but you're surprised that they're done!" exclaimed the Tennisist Svetlan Kuznezov, who met me at the main table.
It is called the main, although it represents an area of 2.7,000 square miles and is ready to host 5,000 visitors at the same time.
It's up to 60,000 dollars a day for free.
The following menu options are "Best from Brazil", "Love of Peace", "Asian Blues" and "Die, Macarone Products".
The last option I've ever seen is to use a lot of popularity in our volleyballists.
And I'm saying I didn't find any soups in one of the giant restaurants.
- What soup?
It's good that I've been caught up in Chinese shit.
And a teamaker.
But in general, to understand, we've got more food on our tables.
There's something here that can be chosen, even though it's an inexhaustible one.
I personally picked up a couple and a fricade in a tomato sauce.
A table with each flower is available in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as in which the food value of the product and its availability is indicated.
Well, I guess it was nice.
I don't even know why this sort of order is always in McDonald`s local.
Third, tired, warm sportsmen are waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Dumping Agency (WADA).
They're subjugating a hunter - a Victorian winner with enough football.
They're provocationing, you can say!
To receive a gift, you need to answer correctly even eight of the ten questions.
There's questions in Russian! - A girl from WADA attacked me.
But it wasn't the attack.
It's me in the patriotism, of course.
The situation was already underway on the second question: "If I received a notice of doping control, should I enter the doping control paragraph immediately?"
I've been thinking about option B, "No, I have one hour."
He's lost, so to speak, being careful.
He forgot that WADA's weaknesses are not expected.
In general, it has to be right away.
Well, at the seventh stage of the Victorian battle, my situation became completely critical.
Why did I think that if I would find it difficult to keep a balanced diet because of my flat chart (and I am tired, hard!), I could use biodegradable supplements to get "additional nutrients to improve my productivity".
No, they won't!
In fact, the answer is that it is not categorically prohibited, but it is imperative that several proposals respond.
It's not fair playing WADA!
How's it going, Roscia?
To leave somewhere behind Efimova, Isinbaeva and all our lost team.
That's why I've been focusing and I've won a bad football since last year.
You know what he's saying, ours!
In a successful mood, I took it to the nearby fitness center.
Get caught up in the coach's report.
It's 250.
Surprisingly, he noted that no Russian sportsman had ever been found in this collection of escape routes.
But maybe it's right?
Let him who can't play train!
And here's one of our boys sitting in a row of police stations.
In the direction of the college.
Don't worry, not a gun.
In the clinic, however, as well as in the entire village where we live, there's a storage device.
And it is said to him by inspiration: "Drive away with your condom!"
It is still only possible to turn the rail that reminds you of the door-to-door lock and the reservation made from the natural latex of the Amazon is ready to be released from the apparatus.
I got myself one, remember.
The sportsmen won't wake up - they've got 450 thousand of them.
As a time for the holiday and holiday time in the Olympian village, there is a full entertainment centre.
On the contrary, it is a well-known table that reminds the International Olympic Committee of its various ways of spending $3.25 million a day on sportsmen.
The centre is located on video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey and some strange devices similar to the video coaches.
What's this? - I'm interested in a friend in the form of a Ukrainian collection that actively uses a dicholine game.
I could, of course, just say that he doesn't want to talk to a man in the form of a Russian collective, yes.
Here's something strange about the situation in the eyes of a child in a yellow blue.
The most playable collection is made.
To cover the entire village, looking at each corner of it, it takes at least three hours.
But if you're going to go and not eat electricians, you're also opened up a Canadian house with lots of entrances and tents with a refurbishment van, a ticket office, a washing machine, a car park, a color shop, and a daily supply chain, and a unique brand (you'll be not able to move around from Chinese Philatellists), a bank, a find office, and a photograph.
Later in the evening, you will sit on the top of an olive tree, surrounded by colorful tapes of the world's friends and relatives.
And you'll be in the company of a machine that's inexhaustible fluid to kill people, to think about forever.
It's about the Olympic movement.
Which doesn't stop in this village for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was still breathing, the Australians felt that they had not punished the American Dream Team, and these patients were on the network.
Little one knows: the news that Inna Derigalzov won the gold in rappie at the XXXI Olympic Games, I got the first.
Maybe I'm the only mouse I've seen how it happened - without considering them, of course, who was watching the Carioca funeral that night.
This can only be understood by this patient.
Here's a stupid Moscow night.
Neighbors down -- as always in the nighttime -- get drunk and start unharmed, but it's very loud to shout at each other.
And threatening to move furniture.
On the kitchen floor, there is no time to travel to the market and buy as a new mechanic asked.
There's nothing in the television schedule, so he just kept track of the Mattch, the First, and in any case Russia -- even though it's almost pointless.
"Rossia" is a family of repeaters, all sports there for something in the records.
There's a series going directly through the ephere.
The hope, of course, at "Match" -- the whole night a young man started shouting in news releases about the great semifinal of Derigalzova -- Shanaeva, then about a war of gold.
It'd be logical to show it.
But instead, the basketball is the United States-Australia.
I don't think I can say anything bad about this.
The Australians were equal, the first half won at all.
They've replaced American officials with their own size.
As a result, it has disappeared, but as it is now expressed, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be over.
It's all right, but it's getting close to the fight with Di Francis on the screen without change.
I'm just starting to go through a little panic.
That's how it feels, the second time it's over.
All right, let's go deep, on the cables.
There's not one of thematic "Mother" fetishes.
And I feel like fighting is starting.
The text and Twitter transfers of some sports sites don't bother me.
The road serfing gives an unexpected but devastating result.
The First website provides a direct technical transmission of all developments that are taking place at this time.
I'm calling for a fetto, I'm getting a piece of gold.
Derigalism is a great contraction, progresses through the eyes, and clearly starts to take time.
The Italians play almost all the waste.
Our eye on one eye in front of us will finally hear more than two seconds.
Di France is on Derigalsova and is leaving, when it is over, the Italians are carrying a load.
Win!
A couple of seconds later, the Olympic Messenger on the phone reported on the fourth gold medal.
I'm the first one to see it with my eyes.
The stupid, the faithful, the happy.
The Muslim Spiritual Management (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in the meetings.
Yesterday, the DOM tribe was obliged by its owners to give Friday sermons only on the Tatar so as to force young fathers to “learn their native language”.
The administration states that it is "no harm" to the rights of other nationalities.
In some meetings, Kazana notes that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60 per cent, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves.
We're afraid their sermons on the Tatar "will not come to the whole audience."
Yesterday, the DUM of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the meetings of the Republic only in the Tatar language.
As Tatarstan's nephew Kamil Samigullin said, this should be an incentive for young tattoos to "learn their native language".
"For those who say it's "hard," in every big dream, we intend to organize the lessons in the Tatar language absolutely free," Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today at all meetings the preaching must be "in the Tatar language".
He recalled that DUM Tatarstan is publishing the magazine "Shura" with typical teaching in the Tatar language.
I've got something that doesn't speak well enough, "it can be properly prepared."
DUM Tatarstan combines more than a thousand revenues in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to the Mufti, Friday’s sermons are held exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, Russian was used in a number of meetings in Kazana.
In particular, as Muftai indicated, this was done in the Burnaev Chamber, Zakaban and Eniler.
However, Mr. Muhametshin stressed that the leadership should be directed to all students in both public languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no harm to a Muslim netator," Mr. Muhammadishin stressed, explaining that the preaching itself "is not a compulsory, basic part of the burden."
At the same time, prayers will continue to be read in Arabic, where lessons and lessons are preserved in Russian.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametshin said, "Oh," that there was no serious threat to suppressing the Tatar language from dreams.
In addition to Russian and Tatar other languages, for example, Uzbek or Tadik, according to him, are not used in the public ministry in the Republic.
The DUM decision was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatar (WCT).
The head of the U.S. Department said "E." "Mets are an important part of our national life."
It would be a shame if the Tatar language were taken out of this area.
He noted that preaching only in the Tatar language "will of the real people", but in the context of the WCT "they think it's right".
We have asked "O" who say Russian preaching is ready to implement the DUM decision, but they believe that there will be difficulties in understanding the clergy.
In the dream, there are also tattoos and Russians.
Many do not understand the language.
Of course they'll be sad.
"It's coming back," said the Burnaev Dream Farhat Maveldinov.
According to him, preaching in Russian is even closer to many Tatars, because "the Russian and in schools and in the children, on radio is going to be great."
However, he believed that the dream could continue the lessons and lessons in the Russian language that would take place during other days.
In God do we put our trust.
Allah will show you the way out."
But about 60% of us don't know the Tatar language.
It's also the deserts, the taigas, and the Azerbaijani.
We have a lot of foreign students: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've been moving to Russian for four years," I say.
He believes that in the Tatar language the preaching will "come to a shorter round and will not reach the whole audience".
But we're going to make a decision.
Only the results of the preaching work will be different.
But time will show.
"I, for example, will only be easier because the Tatar language is my native," Habbdulla Galiullin concluded.
The former director of the FSIN was brought before the court
The Moscow Procurator has approved a prosecution for the criminal case under investigation by the PSC of the Russian FSC for the discharge of the funds allocated to the Russian FCIN.
Before the court, the head of the prison court, Alexander Reymer and his deputy, who caused FSIN damage to more than 2.7 billion rubs, would be present.
The capital prosecutor sent a criminal case to the Zamskvork district for former director of the FSIN Russian Federation, Alexander Reymer, his former deputy, Nicola Kryvolapov, as well as the director of the FGUP, the Information and Technology Centre and the Federal Sanctions Service (FGUP CITOS) Victor Definition.
Depending on the role and extent of participation in the crimes, they are charged with the SPC on Moscow at 3 p. 285 UC RF (inadjustment of official authority, with a serious impact), p. 4 p. 159 CF (difficulty committed by its official status, in the composition of the group, particularly large).
In addition, the Crimeabad is charged with an illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition by 1 p. 222 of the UC RF (unlawful acquisition and storage of ammunition).
By version of the CPC, in 2010-2012, the persons indicated had been reportedly punished by the State fine by the budgets allocated by FSIN to ensure that the systems of electronic monitoring of sub-controlled persons, such as the so-called electronic
To finance the budget, the Group developed a scheme whereby its CITOS subsidiary, which concluded the relevant public contracts, produced technical means of control and supervision, including electronic
Despite the absence of production equipment, buildings, equipment for the installation of production forces to create an end-of-cycle “electronic explosives” between FGUP and FCIN Russia, five contracts were concluded for more than 3.3 billion rubles.
As a result of this scheme, over two billion rubs were found on the accounts of the Samaritan branch, of which 1.2 billion rubs were stolen.
As a result, more than 140 million rubs of money was received by Mr. Reimmer in his office by one of the participants for which a criminal case was committed in a separate production.
Nicola Krivolabov, who participated in the machines, found an unknown origin of the patrol to the prize gun, which allowed him to be charged with additional charges.
According to this case of 133 toms, FSIN claimed to be charged with material damage of 2.7 billion rubs.
Hakan Shokyura football player suspects participation in the race.
The Turkish authorities ordered an arrest of an former footballer and then a member of parliament, Hakan Shukhur, to search two homes of his family.
The Turkish football star of the 1990s - the beginning of the 2000s of the attack by Hong Kong Shukhur is being investigated by the authorities of the country in connection with a coup attempt that took place last month.
Forvard, who completed his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to the “armed terrorist group”.
It's about the movement of Hizmet, a society associated with a well-known Turkish religious character and oppositionist Fethoullah Gulen.
His President, Erdogan, is considered to be the organizer of a military coup attempt on 15 July.
Fethullah Gulen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media, a warrant was issued today for the arrest of Hakan Shukhur, and the police have already searched two houses belonging to the family of the former footballer.
According to the survey, the organization of Fethullah Gulena included his father in addition to Hakan Shukhur himself.
However, neither the former football player nor his neighbors did.
He and his family are now living in the United States.
As a footballer, Hakan Shukhur protected several Turkish clubs and spoke for the country.
Most of his career he did in Galatasara.
The list of foreign clubs includes the Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as the English "Blackburn".
True, not one of them spent more than one season.
Hukan Shukur remains the most effective attacker in Turkey: 112 national team fighters and 51 killed dogs.
In 2013, Hakan Shukhur left his MP's post because of the start of the corruption investigation around the Erdogan party and its immediate environment.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, an arrest warrant was issued in Turkey on 25 July at least 42 journalists.
They are accused of promoting military conversion and ties with opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States.
In view of the severity of the charges, the media may expect long-term prison terms from ten years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovski wants to create a network of filmmakers only for domestic films.
"I would create a network of filmmakers exclusively for Russian film, which stood in 2-3 times less than in foreign production films," he said.
Mr. Conchalovsky notes that Russian films find it difficult to compete for a viewer with large Hollywood tapes.
We have more than 100 maps per year in the country, from which to the screens range from 20 to 25 lenses per year.
"And even it's very difficult for them to interact with "Transformers" and "The Green Man", moving huge budgets," said the director.
Remember, on 1 July, the Youth Education Forum of the Russian Federation was launched in Crimea.
Among the participants were teachers of creative professions and young professionals from all over Russia and a number of neighbouring and far-reaching countries.

E-Newsty - The new Genocide promises to give Zenit Arene until 26 December.
The new Gen sponsor of the St. Petersburg stadium, which is to be hosted by the Cuban Confederation 2017 and the 2018 World Football Championship, "Metrostray" promises to award the rent until 26 December, reports " RIA News" with reference to the head of the Interim Commission of the Federation for the Training of Peace Championship on Football 2018 by Vadima Tulpanova.
"Today we, along with the Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko, visited the stream, with us was the Chief of Metrostoy Vadim Aleksandrov.
He said he'd set up a stadium by 26 December.
It's a serious peterburg company. It's never breaking time.
Vitalia Mutko and I have remained quite visible and heard," quoted the condolences agency.
Previously, Vitaly Mutco had arrived in St. Petersburg to review the site of round-the-clock rounds.
Mr. Tulpanov also noted that his board of directors would continue to monitor the construction of the stadium and would visit the strike regularly.
Remember, yesterday it was known that the Metrostray company would complete the construction of Zenit-Arena, which would cost about 5.4 billion rubs. The same company won trade in goods in the area of the stadium, the contract price of 2.4 billion rubs. Contracts with AO "Transstroy Corporation", OO "Transstroy-Spb" and OO "Transstroy Engineering Corporation" were broken.
Two other companies were not allowed to fight the construction of the stadium.
For more details on selecting a new generator, read "E" "Metrostray" material on the field.
In Miasse (Chelabin District), former Deputy Governor Nicholas Sandakov Konstantin Akulić was detained.
As another lawyer, Sergei Colossian, who was charged with the "E-South Ural" reported, Konstantin Akulica today called on the Bureau of Investigation to file an annual charge of murder.
Then Constantine Aculić went to the DTP as a lawyer to help one of his participants.
"It was particularly excited about the unknown, and now that it started protecting Nicola Sandakova it seemed to be Akulic," Sergei Colossian says.
Constantine Aculić became an ex-government deputy lawyer in early August.
At the same time, before the appeal of a lawyer at the MIAS, the defence party was informed that on Monday there was a time limit for finding evidence of fraud in which Nikola Sandakov was accused.
Remember, two criminal cases have been initiated against Nicola Sandakova.
Under the first (the case of fraud), he was violated by a pledge of $1.5 million. To facilitate the appointment of the Chief of the Magnitor of the Administration of Oserska Eugenia Tarasova.
The second criminal case relates to the acquisition by Nicolai Sandakov of both of whom received by the Director of the PI “Piton” Igora Kalugina in the form of an illegal free supply of property services of at least 1.3 million rubs.
Read more about Mr. Sandakova's case in the material "O" "The former Deputy Governor needs to bring his affairs together".
The Russian Medical Company (RMC) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that RMC has taken on the modernization of one of the oldest and most environmentally "serious" companies in the country - the Caribbean Mediterranean.
The shipyard was founded by an English stock company in the head of Lesley Urkwart in 1910.
In Soviet times it was important for the economy of the country ' s industry, and it actually made the whole city alive.
However, because of financial problems in the 1990s, production has been halted, which has caused serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Caribbean Medal.
It was also necessary to address one of the main problems of the Karabash Foundation - environmental.
By the beginning of 2000, Karabash had been well known as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the company moved under the control of the Russian Medical Company.
The company began to modernise production, which gradually reduced environmental burden on the environment.
This was also noted recently by Governor Boris Dubrovski, governor of the Chelabinian region, who first visited Karabašmede in July.
The head of the South Ural called for the radical changes that have taken place since Karabashmedi was transferred to the RMK Group.
The main initiative to modernise Karabashmedi in recent years has been to build a new sernoquistal cell that allows up to 99.9 per cent of metallurgy gases to be absorbed.
According to the President of the Russian Medical Company, the amount of investment in the project amounted to around 7 billion rubs.
The next phase of modernization of the Karabashmed is the reconstruction of the conversion.
The replacement of three converters, propellers, gas pipelines is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubs.
In addition, by the end of 2016 it is planned to launch new cleanings of industrial goods worth $1 billion.
In turn, the amount of taxes calculated in the budget of the city of Karabash will also be increased.
For the entire period of implementation of the Tominian GOC project, from the start of construction and before the second round of operation, the federal fine will be 8.9 billion rubs.
After the introduction of GOC into the operation of all levels of budget taxation, there may be $80.9 billion.
For the year of production in the Varnish region, there are 346.3 million rubs in various levels.
And that's for the first year.
"As long as the company works successfully, the amount of the calculations may be higher," added Valerie Ulanovski.
In the IPCC, it was explained that in 2015, tax returns from the Micheev GOC approached approximately 1 billion rubs.
However, the participation of SMEs in the life and development of their territories is not limited by tax deductions.
RMK companies help to rebuild and maintain schools, children's gardens, sports facilities, cultural and recreational facilities, and to provide facilities.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Medical Company in Karabash became a capital repair and, in fact, almost all of the children's farm N9 has been rehabilitated by 95 pupils.
The building built in 1960 was in an emergency.
Also within the territory of RMC Arena are a landscape park with artificial fur, underground and fine parking on 600 cars, coffee and sports shops.
RMC Arena will allow mature international sports activities to be conducted.
But the main objective of this project is to make physical and sport available to the people of Chelyabinsk, primarily for children.

WSJ: The United States of America is considering the imposition of sanctions against the RF because of the abuse of democratic servers.
Officials of the United States are considering the introduction of new sanctions against Russia in response to the violations of the Democratic Party ' s servers, says The Wall Street Journal, referring to sources.
It is reported that in order to impose sanctions on the administration of President Baraka Obama of the United States, he should be charged with an official attack on the Russian server or supported by the Russian hacker authorities.
According to sources, the FBI and other United States departments are practically convinced of Russia's participation in cyberattack.
WSJ notes that the United States generally prefers not to indicate only those who are carrying out hacker attacks.
The exemption was made in 2014 by the company Sony Entertainment Pictures database, which was officially charged to CND.
In the past year, however, Obama issued an order facilitating the imposition of sanctions on those who are implementing or contributing to cyberattacks.
It was directed against China, but could also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be long, the issue writes.
Even if officials have come to the conclusion that the hackers have acted in support of Russia, they will have to have possible consequences before the decision to disclose information.
They should determine whether such a serious event is likely to increase tension in bilateral relations.
It was previously reported that Barack Obama ' s administration allowed the use of sanctions against the State which had violated the officials of the Democratic Party ' s Nazi party.
The WikiLeaks site published an electronic record of the National Committee of Democrats.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in the loan.
In Crimea, such reports were considered absurd.
FAS hit Google nearly half a billion rubles
This has resulted in a distortion of competition on the market of mobile applications.
The Anti-Fraud Treatment was initiated on the initiative "Yandex".
The Russian company claimed that Google is providing smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that prevented applications from being stopped by other developers, in particular from the “Yandex”.
The FAS found confirmation of these claims and established that the company misused the dominant market situation and forced the manufacturers of mobile devices to install together with Google Play other applications.
As a result of the verification, the Federal Anti-Fraud Service decided to punish Google, informed FAS leader Aleksey Docenko.
The penalty shall be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the decision.
The FAS concluded that the competition protection law should be respected by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In its turn, Google has begun to study the decision and only then will be determined by the following actions: whether to execute it or to defend it.
The Federal Anti-Fraud Service recognized the company as a violation of competition law still in September last year and provided for the adjustment of treaties by 18 December.
However, Google did not agree.
Since then, companies and the public are conducting judicial proceedings.
The FAS noted that, despite the fines, they discussed with Google the possibility of concluding a world agreement.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This was the opinion of Ehu Moskwe, leading analyst Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the punishment was never meant either to users or to the competitiveness of the corporation.

The "Anime" effect Snapchat criticises as a cartoon for Asians
Snapchat says that this filter is inspired by animation, but some critics say it's racially racist.
With the help of the Linz tool Snapchat, about 150 million users per day are allowed to change the reality and play with individual ways that limit the absurdity.
You can turn yourself into ananas, a dog or a person to get a picture of Roy Lichtenstein.
Linces is a rough, cutting tool that creates more than 30 million correctional cells a day.
Any mistakes will soon become known.
Snapchat's lines have been criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising dark skin or encouraging selected persons as an ideal for beauty.
So when some users offered this week a license, which gave them their hair with eyes, teeth, and mouthpieces, some critics thought it was a racist cartoon for Asians, "jellolitics".
They also asked whether these repeated objections to a more serious problem of the differential company.
In the middle, reports were circulated and then non-reported at The Verge and Motherboard, the following day after Snapchat said they had taken up this function.
The company commented: the lens was thought to be an address to the people of the animation, not as a cartoon for Asians.
But experts who know about racism are not listening, however, the lens has been reminded of disturbing stereotypes in action.
The other completely rejected the comparison with the animation.
In an e-mail letter to Grace Sprapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about photographs were active, she said that the lens was "screaming and at least unconscious".
She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison of the side of a very harsh caricature on Asians and filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just jealousy; it is highly destructive.
Snapchat is not the only company that passes through these cultural bridges.
The American culture seems to be involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness from the corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the girls we are all wearing.
And the vast audience of young people in Snapchat -- which are more racially diverse than their older generation -- can mean that they are more likely to have understanding.
When one of Snapchat's lines creates an image that is offensive to the user, she said in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Ju, "that's the way things are so much harder to remain undetected as they were before".
On Thursday Ju, the product manager and the medium engineer decided to remove their account account at Snapchat and invited others to do the same.
In an article for the Media and in a telephone interview, she said that racial differences were a cause of insufficient diversity in the collection of staff in Snepta.
Jou criticised the company's chiefly white leadership, consisting only of men and finished her article with a hug: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Juu, who himself is an American from China, wrote: "There were not enough white people in the state to make such decisions or to have white people working with them, but they did not take such positions as can be safely and openly expressed."
Other commentators share her point of view, expressing disappointment that Snapchat had not answered most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the racial background of his staff on Thursday, but according to the trusted person, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on the inadequately represented areas of the population and on active domestic efforts.
On its part, Jou said that she would keep her account in Snapchat closed, adding: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that they won't. "
The military leadership reported information on IGIL, reporting to the Congress Committee
Officials from the Central Command of the Armed Forces of the United States have amended the intelligence reports to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than give the grounds for the local events reported by the Congress Commission on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group, established by the Presidents of the Committee of Representatives of the Committee of Representatives of the WC, the Disclosure Committee and the Sub-Committee on Military Provisions, found “a widespread lack of satisfaction” among the analysis of the Central Intelligence Service, which claimed that the leaders had conducted their assessment of American actions aimed at the conquest of the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as the Centre, is the main military administration in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence documents approved by the Supreme Command of the Centre have usually given a more optimistic picture of the counter-terrorism actions of the United States than actual data from the event site and have been more stable than the analysis provided by other specialized services”, said the news release on the report.
"What happened in Centcoma is unacceptable: when there is an untrustworthy analysis, our soldiers suffer," said a member of the House of Representatives of Ken Calvert, a Republican of California.
The problems with leadership in the Centcoma have reached the highest level of organization.
The 10-year report provides a detailed understanding of the ongoing shortcomings in the 2014 and 2015 United States in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training Iraq ' s armed forces under the Central Command.
While it does not contain final evidence that the members of the Administration of Obama had ordered the falsification of reports, it claims that analysts felt that the Centcoma leadership had forced them to submit a more optimistic view of the threat by the Islamic State, also known as IGIL or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony from the Central Command at the Congress were much more optimistic than actual events,” reported the report.
For example, the Centcoma official has publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is known as a verifier," said a member of the House of Representatives of Mike Pompeo, a Republican of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest lead of the intelligence service of the United States Central Command has been shared by the intelligence commissions to reduce the risk of IGIL in Iraq.
The Republicans set up an operational group when they learned that the analysts were concerned that the information about the Islamic State had been misrepresented.
As the investigation progresses, more developed data are reported on Thursday.
In addition, not yet completed, the investigation by the Centre was conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
The representatives of the Democratic Party to the Disclosure Committee of the Assembly of the Representatives of the United States Congress published their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Operation Group.
"The Centre has established an excessive closed procedure for the production of intelligence assessments on IGIL and Iraq's security forces between 2014 and 2015, " , says a member of the House of Representatives of Adam B. Šiff, the Chief Representative of the Democratic Party of the Committee.
This procedure, according to the Chief of Staff, "has prevented the issue of intelligence documents", has affected the moral state of analysts and has “not reflected sufficient cost-effectiveness”.
But the Chief and Democrats claim that they have not found evidence that the White House has tried to influence Centco's analysts to reach their conclusions under "exploited or political interpretation".
The preliminary results of the Congress survey were presented on Tuesday at the Portal of The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Chief Inspector of Penttagon, who was found following a complaint by Centcoma analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, representative of the Pentagon, said that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress until the Chief Inspector-General's investigation continued.
But he said that "experts sometimes spend their views on the processing of comprehensive data and the Department of Defence welcomes a healthy dialogue on these vital issues of national security".
The results of the investigation are based on whether the targets of the US-led bombing in Iraq and Syria are met (as is now being approved by more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
However, last year's statements raise doubts as to whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
The criticism of information about the Islamic State repeats the arguments that took place more than ten years ago when the intelligence analyst Centcoma Gregory Hucker wrote a research article, which claimed that President George Walker Bush's administration, because of the protests of many analysts, had expressed support for the small number of troops in Iraq and had not thought what would happen after the launch of 2003.
Hucker also played a key role in the protest brought to light by the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, the Huker team concluded that despite public statements on the return of oil tankers belonging to the Islamic State, it did not lead to a significant deterioration in the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had set up temporary oil pipelines to sell oil on the black market.
However, the opening was not extended beyond the Central Command, as reported in September in the Times newspaper.
The then Commander of Centcoma, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was critical last year after the witness in Senate, which many Members considered to be too optimistic about the war.
General Austin withdrew in April and was replaced by the Central Commandation Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The United States dollar has won 4 times the women's hockey on the ground, thus drawing closer to the decision-making process with Britain
Killing three holes in a match that ended up winning over Japan with account 6-1, Katie Bam found a account in the fourth quarter of the first two holes for the U.S. Women's Hook on the ground when Americans won over India's team with account 3-0.
Five chapters in two games should be memorable, but B.B., who is 27 years old, says she's not sure if she would ever do something like that.
"I don't think I'll apply," she said.
Actually, I'm not one of those who follow their feet.
This is what she knows: the 4-0 American account in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for the first place in their group with Britain, which remains unbeatable after Japan's 2-0 match on Thursday.
The British and US teams will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams claim for a quarter-final, and the result of the game determines who will take the first place in their group of six teams and who is the second.
The winner will avoid meetings with a strong team of contestants from the Netherlands, the leaders of another group, shortly after the game of the quarter-finals begins.
However, the Saturday game shows that Americans here made their unexpected series sound, four years after they took their last place among 12 teams in London.
Bam was in that command.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time she took the key to the field hockey when she was 3 (her older siblings played in this type of sport in Drexel), and joined the National Assembly at the age of 16, became her youngest in history.
She missed Olympia in 2008, when she didn't go through the final tour.
He then arrived in 2012, when she and her teammate did not have everything.
The following year Koyeg Parnheim, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything started to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, physical training change," said Bam.
In London we didn't have any productivity that is now.
We've completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, B.B. opened the account in the first half of the game with an uncomfortable hand in short distance.
India came to the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team showed itself to be surprised and kept account 1 to 0 until the end of the third period when Bam took the initiative in his hands.
She made a long walk down the left side of the field, then she walked into the middle and quickly sent the sword into the door, thus giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final round in the middle of the fourth period.
The victory was the first in a tournament for the U.S. Jacky Briggs, who passed one round in each of the first three victories.
She's hit.
Like Bam.
"We are in a good position right now," said Parnham, but how good it depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
In the midst of the lack of Olympic games - "day" of battle
Wherever you are, no matter what time it is now, it's Olympia.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are said to be irreplaceable and inevitable, which was a combination of confusion and aspirations.
I mean, it's an Olympic fire, and there's the burning façade that's transferred from the cannon to the flesh, to the gymnasium, to the triathlonist.
You can't include TV, respect the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors talk about coffee and don't hear about Simon Bayles, Katie Ledeki or about the enmity between Michael Phillips and Chad de Clo.
There's still Logan Douli.
Dulls, the first participant in the Olympic Games, a jewellery with scarfs, could be one of the famous figures that are shown in the prime-times that promote sponsors and life-threatening advertising roles if he was a poet, gymnast or even a fan.
But 28-year-old Douli from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold at Olympic Battalion.
The Olympic fire does not light all events alike.
Far from the center, partly in the dark, there are types of sports that are not generally recognized: pneumatic gun shots, light shots, badminton, tekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, he's a long kingdom.
But if I'm allowed to say a job to protect my personal passion, let me draw your attention to the humble use of battalions.
Although battalion attacks are an Olympic sport since 2000, when they deduce in the games in Sydney, they received little recognition over the past 16 years that many of my people were not in the course, that they were at all about Olympic sports.
This may be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States and sent athletes to the competitions, they never won medals in battle races, and their athletes did not finish up until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians usually share men's rewards, and the Chinese and Canadians are women's.
Don Dun from China and Rose Maclennan from Canada will protect their London gold medals this year.
But battalions have an austere charm, especially since they are associated with the circus more quickly than with the Olympic Games.
Here I must admit that I'm not an expert, but a land-based enthusiasm.
They actually have a chemical potential — the caricature of endless seeds — but also the survival of gymnasiums and baths in water, the two types of sports they mainly combine in themselves.
The word "butt" comes from the Spanish word "el trampoline", meaning "trapple for water springs".
The winners are driven by a giant battalion of nearly 30 feet in the air and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (revealing, swiping and salt) until the final landing on the feet.
They are evaluated for performance, complexity and "fly time", according to the official Olympic Games programme.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will meet in Rio.
The most widely distributed Olympic course is ahead.
The medal winners must go further, faster, higher and higher in gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forward, there in the field.
They strive not only for the final painting or the start wall but also for the telecommer, to the other exciting border: the world or the Olympic record.
This earnest desire is noble, worthy of awakening, even fantastic — and it is enough for even the sighting.
But I think it's just a couple of things that bother me when I look at the game.
From him, the shoes on the boots give the front cover.
Batutists' direction is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps like an astronaut, flys up, then down, then no effort.
And, of course, they do not deal with competition or difficulties, but throughout the programme there is no mind at all to finish, there are no gaps in the long run, only a weird, sudden disappearance of time and gravity.
It's the closest to the Olympic Day.
Women's qualifications are met, and then the final will take place on Friday, the transition on the day of the Eastern European era; men on the Saturday, as well as on the clock.
The NBC will transmit the final within the agenda from 14:00 a.m. on two days.
The Olympic mixture is expected to be a calm, beautiful moment, which can easily be seen in a common setting.
And if awareness can only be achieved by male athletes with guided views and objectives, as the Wall Street Journal has recently predicted that U.S. gay men will only be waiting for Douli to see his new set of fans.
"Birth protests" in Ethiopia, United States long-standing Union
Arbitrary protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators requiring political change in Ethiopia faced a brutal opposition from the Government.
It is obvious that dozens of protesters were fatally injured during police encounters.
Is Ethiopia really on the brink of extinction?
Over the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong Western Union with a rapidly developing economy.
In recent months, however, anti-governmental protests have intensified the country by expanding its territory.
Only in the last week have thousands gone to the streets requiring radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s response was cruel.
The observers claimed that the police officers had shot dozens of unarmed protesters.
Videos from protest sites, supposedly taken at the end of the past year or early this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands on the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country from falling and it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, head of the project "African Rog" in the international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second most densely populated country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa has received such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is developing at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably — even a new spring trip to the capital of Addis Ababa.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy - human rights organizations have always mentioned governmental repression - opposition to the State ' s territory has been overcome by the fact that the dissidents have actually kept silent.
Many of them were sent, imprisoned, killed or thrown into distant deserts.
But it can change.
"If people are constantly beating and leaving no other options than to protest, there will be a rise," said Seyum Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
The complaints are numerous, starting with land use, ending with the arrest of the government coalition.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the Government party and its allies had completely extenuated the opposition and now controlled 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, pressure along the Eritrea border is growing; the fight against this uncertain and controversial border has led to hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been destroyed more or less in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use ammunition and weapons.
A number of factors explain why painful emotions, which have been deeply rooted in the soul for several years, are now taking place.
First of all, it would be absolutely harmless: smartphones.
In the last few years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to gather in social networks, since cheap smartphones have become vulnerable and Internet services have improved.
Even when the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still have the opportunity to communicate through a proxy that hides where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that they were organized for protests.
Second, there is more solidarity between Rome and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara has flourished in politics and business through the ministry of Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in lower regions.
But it's also changing.
"We'll act together at the same time," said Mulat Gemech, leader of Oromo.
The biggest protests have taken place in the regions of Amhari and Oromo.
Many of the Amariya and Oromo feel that in Ethiopia, members of the ethnic group of Tiguria are unjustly dominated by some 6 per cent of the population and are under the control of military and intelligence services, trade and policy.
A third reason for anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenaui.
Meles, the former rebel leader, has been carrying out the duties of the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, resulting in his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could predict danger.
Analytics claim that he was particularly skilled at identifying the first signs of dissatisfaction and using investigators to obtain data and satisfy opposers.
"The current regime does not have a sound sense," said Abdi, an analyst on conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hillary Desaljan, appeared from nowhere and took place at Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was born from the Tigris region in northern Ethiopia, Hillemariam is a southern country.
Analysts say he does not benefit from the confidence of security services controlled by Tiguria.
Many fear that this will lead to further bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia survived such bombings in 2005, after thousands of people were protesting against the fact that, as analysts said, there were apparently elections that the Government had ordered and then resulted.
During the follow-up repressions, many Protestants were killed, even in less than the last few months, and this period of evasion was relatively rapid.
Development experts expressed appreciation to Ethiopia ' s leaders for the long-term development of infrastructure, such as a new international journey and significant achievements in combating poverty.
However, it is evident that this has not resulted in an increase in internal discontent by the Government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
In the past month, protestors in Honduras, the city of Amhar, attacked companies belonging to Turkey and anti-Tigerian hatred in social networks became comprehensive.
Analysts claim that the United States and other Western allies are in a bad position.
The US Government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights to neighbouring Somalia, although it had recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, he does not want his Union to lose its force in an already unstable region.
"And it's gonna be hard to get through this damn canyon," Abdi said.
Donald Tramp explains his statement that IGIL was based on both, "sircum"
Donald J. Tramp tried to replace the last conflict covering his pre-election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was mistaken when several times this week said President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the candidate to serve as President of the Republican Party to address the people of the United States.
It also appointed its alternates who tried to protect him during the time of trouble, in a state of disparity, as they had been able to explain statements that he probably did not have in mind.
In expressing this assumption of meeting in the middle of the evening, Trump strongly insisted on his fourth approval, repeating in the interview that he was actually saying that President Clinton and IGIL were founded.
But in Twitter's post early on Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just evicting.
This post was a direct contradiction to the allegations made earlier on the day that Trump stated in several interviews that he was serious in his charge.
When Radio Conservative H.H.H.H.H.I.E. tried to help Trumpu ease his statement, he was reminded that Obama wanted to destroy IGIL, a candidate for the presidential post of the Republican party had not taken advantage of the opportunity.
The last scandal broke out when Trump tried to redirect his campaign to the economy on the basis of a reduction in ratings.
Tripp and Clinton spoke on the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to get back to the subject.
Once again, he fled to Twitter, warned that Clinton's plans would increase taxes, and said that she felt bad about it.
Tramp used to use a warrant as a justification.
At the end of July, after he got caught up in a general criticism, he practically said that Russia should break Clinton's e-mail, and later he explained his comments, saying, "Of course, I'm looking."
Such a approach would allow Trump to go beyond the allowed political word and take his words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing those or other communications that have been rejected among his worshipers to see how they are doing and then "to explain" them somewhere, depending on the response," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who was conducting an analysis of the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful in his speech and he knows that they're out enough to treat them differently.
Instead of simplifying the expressions for the large electric power, Trump has taken even more tonne in the last days, while his rating continues to decline.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed that Trump was entering Clinton with a large shipment in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and coming with it at Florida level.
Although Trapp usually tries not to apologize for what he says, he often accuses his critics of misinformed interpretation of his words and does not understand his sense of humor.
However, as Tramp became the subject of the presidential campaign in recent months, his lies placed his loyal allies in a state of disparity: they had to publicly support him whatever his provocations were.
Rudolf U. Juliani, former mayor of New York, one of the most famous representatives of Trapa, made serious efforts to protect a candidate in an interview by CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political comment," Juliani said, when he was asked about the credibility of the claim of Trapa that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama IGIL was almost an unknown little organization, he called it an unprovoked threat, absolutely unjust, and that's why it all happened because he pulled out an army from Iraq.
Most of the media-statistic republics believe that the administration of Obama, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, has allowed IGIL to develop as it was not able to handle the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to the meeting in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trap continued to attack on Twitter the media for the sake of dissuasiveness and prejudging it.
He looked at "poor unfortunate" television experts trying to tell him, and he said, "They're weak!"
Some democracies have mocked the rights of Trapa as a mere statement that he is not in the presidential position.
Once the excited coffee comes back to Greenpoint.
The Verb coffee was widely accepted only in Williamsburg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but had been given a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was pulled out of her room with a glass on Bedford Avenue.
The Sop Sheri store, which took place in Werb in 2014, is sold in the form of kexa.
The locals complained of her as the last loss in the modern city.
Aunt Molly Crabapel wrote on Twitter: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB's dead, Chelsea's hotel is destroyed, and Werb's now became a store of honey."
But while New York is constantly changing, it is constantly updating.
The Verb coffee plant was opened in November last year in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original.
The new Werbe has Wi-Fi and is receiving credit cards, but there are still some of the same staff and similar to the simple atmosphere.
At the same time, coffee's still good.
In the head of the new Verba, Sisko Rodriguez, an old officer of the old coffee shop, is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered him a new place, he said he would be happy to go.
Rodriguez, 36 years old, left many behind.
Werb works with the same beech distributor and bought the same model of coffee.
It even has illustrations from the old Verba.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He offered new blinds.
The menu presents sandwiches with bacon, egg and cheese, and there are toppings from the cuppers or hot hole.
There's a blue from the brown rice.
There's no beer in the coffee anymore, but now they're making fresh juices.
Nine months later Rodriguez said he had focused on the constant flow of old permanent customers.
"Many former customers have also paid prices from Williamsberg," he shared.
In one of the recent resurrections, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Olivier, who lived in Williamsberg before, was 34 years old and often visited Verb.
Even after she moved to Grinpoint, she still went there.
After closing the Verba, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that the coffee and the atmosphere improvised me in the "Werbe," she said.
Now she has five coffees again, although that day she ordered another newspaper instead of the usual coffee.
Tom Rosentel, another old client, visited Verb since 2003.
He went to work and ordered the same.
"At fifteen minutes of the eighth, every day, as in times past, I came, and my luggage was prepared with oil and with all kinds of means," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and put new blues in the menu.
Today Rosental still makes a normal order, but sometimes he changes something by means of a bacon, eggs or cheese on a ball in all kinds of ways.
Rodriguez said he wasn't trying to find out that the store was once owned by an old place.
Moreover, the Sopo Sherry owners offered to prepare a special oil for Verba, using coffee coffee prepared in a cold way as an ingredient.
"I think we may agree on their proposal," Rodriguez said.
The residents of Greenpoint of Poland also loved this coffee.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he planned to find a place for him in the street so that his new neighbors would feel comfortable.
There are other benefits in the new place.
The local point for the sale of juice is designed to separate by bottles and sell coffee made in a cold way.
There is the possibility that a nearby building will be attached to the coffee shop.
For many customers, it's enough that the new Verb includes their favorite blues in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a permanent client and divided himself into being killed in the woods when they closed.
When the coffee was opened in a new place, Witt said that when he came in and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt he was coming home.
"How long have I wanted to feel this aroma," he confessed.
Depressive eating of depression in the "Float trapeze"
In March 1933, shortly after the election of the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt visited the Oval office.
As a guruman, President Roosevelt loved fashion blues Fifth Avenue, for example, fowa-grey and the meriland peacock soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: crushed eggs in a tomato sauce, potatoes powder and on dessert - powdered powder.
"It was an act of colonial solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Zigelman.
Her husband, Andrew Cou, added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to ask."
The couples living in Brooklyn Heights are food professionals.
The last book of Koua, "Ragu More Chinese", was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Zigelman told the story of life in a dry room in the South East Side by eating in his book "Dom 97 on the Street of Fruit Garden".
Their new work on the Plattsa, which will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is the story of the American Food in the Great Depression.
They met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small-scale ski resort in the Flytteron district, which has been working since 1929 in the Birze Rock.
Zigelman, 54, ordered a slender cheese and butter with olive leaves, and Cou, 57 took the Indian, potatoes and fruit juice.
When the reporter ordered a meat roll, the couple considered it an appropriate starting point for the discussion of food in the period of Depression.
"The roulettes were used with great demand," said Zigelman.
There was an archipelago, a printout, a doll.
They were made from basic ingredients and pastries that allowed the ingredients to grow.
Imagine you've got as much rice as you need to eat.
Who's got it?
"He must have been lying in a gravestone," he said.
In the years leading up to the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was presented as a Swedish table.
Women's groups were preparing for men working on the farm, and the fresh beer was served for breakfast, lunch and lunch.
That's why Americans sent food to hungry Europeans during World War I. The "Fate trap" describes how the country had managed to stop being a country of extinction.
"It was the time when food became a central, difficult subject for Americans," Kou said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Similarly, the new budget reasoning was not easy: wet flowers, such as roulettes and pasta, became the main food products; the pasta is a "pretty way to use food," noted Zigelman, because they were able to stop unappreciative ingredients under a thick layer of soy sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by fresher fruits.
The meat, which has been an American food base for many years, has become an economical crop.
People have had strange mixes because energy and food value have become more important than taste and even culinary health.
In the study of the book containing recipes, Zigelman prepared the flower of that era: a sealed leaf with archiastic oil.
"This addition to the promised table was not successful," Kou said.
Zigelman added, "That was really weird."
Achieving oil is not perfect.
This was natural for many household recipes.
As never before and ever since, house - to - house professionals, including Luisa Stanley, head of the Federal Housing Office from 1923 to 1943, have managed food skills in countries.
In public recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budget makers” to respond to challenges and transform the burden of lost spragettes into delicious flowers.
"The Pitfall" is the fragrant of loving historical facts.
Especially noteworthy is the Government's reaction to starving citizens, for example, the position of President Herbert Govera in the spirit of "let the pirates eat."
A simple farm village in the state of Iowa was publicly transported during its childhood, and he was asked as a retired millionaire.
"He liked continental cuisine, for example, fish with bitter sauce," Kou said.
He was practically in the golden table, hope of smoking.
He was fantastically blinded by reality.
President Roosevelt could make the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to give him an example of his own jealousy.
As described in the book, Eleanor Russell bought an economy that was totally not interested in the taste, and this led to the White House "using not only its own unique food in Washington but once also its most poorly prepared."
Many of the colonial adoptions of the period of Depression were forgotten as the country once again stood on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and food, says Zigelman, and on how science has been used to prepare food.
The husband explains that during writing the book they had better understood the eating habits of Zigelman’s mother — that she could not eat, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of the negativity of food," Kou said.
Zigelman says, "It's a whole lot of people."
There was one unpleasant case with profitrols.
When the eisenberg's deserters arrived, they and Kou got a dessert that they prepared at home: a black dessert, which President Ruzvelt El ate.
"It's called a black muscle," said Zigelman, adding that it was a widespread acceptance -- to give low recipes of broccoli names.
There were not only blacks, little pain, drought, water, and drought.
They've all loaded a bed in a wet, useful, soft material.
Surprisingly, it was harmless.
Who asked for more than two additions.
He said with the voice of a trusted budgetary officer: "A few rubbed Greek oranges would not be mixed here."
The arrest of figures for mass drug at the Hovan camp was extended until 14 November.
The Presbyterian Court left before 14 November under arrest figures of mass drug cases at the Hovansk camp, meeting the relevant request for investigation.
In fact, 14 persons were convicted.
Recall that on 14 May there was a massive shock on the central Asian and North Caucasus, which resulted in the death of three persons.
The former leader of the camp of Yuriu Chabuev and the lawyer, co-chair of the public organization "Health Nation" Alexander Bocharnik, was charged with murder.
The second issue for 2016 could be addressed in the next two or three weeks.
This was reported on 12 August by the Vice-President of the Government of RF Olga Goldec during a visit to the Briansk area.
We have specific parameters on how much pension is needed to reflect inflation in the country.
All calculations have been made.
Now the economists are doing half a year's work, and we're going to finish this work in the next two or three weeks," says Goldec Interfax.
Commenting on the proposed head of the Centre for Strategic Development by Alexe Qudrin on the plan to increase pension age for each year, the Vice-President said that the topic was not addressed in the cabinet.
At the end of July it was known that the Government had agreed on the full index of pension payments in 2017.
Stone and Grigorian have gone to the end of shooting matches from the small-scale Wintow.
The Russian athletes Sergey Stoneski and Kirill Grigoryan have gone to the end of the shooting contest from the small-scale Wintow from the position of the Olympic Games in Brazil.
As TASS reports, Sergei Stones took 629 ballasts and took the first place - this is the new Olympic record of qualifications.
Cyril Grigorian became the second - 628.9.
There were eight better athletes in the final.
Stone is the world recordman in this discipline (633).
The Turkish oppositioner Fethullah Gulen requested an international investigation into the conditions of the attempted coup in Turkey.
"I require the independent international commission to conduct an investigation into the attempted coup," quoted the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition also stated that "if any part of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Guillen refused to participate in the presidency, stressing that his organization had never appealed to the political authority.
The Stambulla court had previously been arrested by opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen.
Recall that the military conversion attempt took place in Turkey on the night of 15 to 16 July.
Gilead Companies Reimbursement of Legal Services during a patent dispute between Hepatitis C and Merck
The Gilead Sciences Inc company has the right to reimbursement of the costs of legal services it has incurred in relation to the burden of hepatitis C patent with the manufacturer of Merck & Co Inc medicinal products, has appointed a federal district judge.
In June, the Gilead company was exempted from the payment of $200 million for damage to two Merck patents related to the drugs of Gilead, the sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the American judge found several violations by Merck, including a lie under oath and other non-ethical practices.
In court proceedings in the fourth U.S. Federal District Court judge, Beth Lebson Freeman said that the company of Gilead had the right to compensate for the costs incurred during the investigation.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 per cent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck were handed over to each other in court, declaring their rights to laboratory work based on Sofosbuvir, an active medical agent of Gilead.
The armed forces established with the support of the United States claim to have taken full control of Manbage in the Islamic State
The armed forces established with the support of the United States seized full control of the northern city of Manbij along with the Turkish border after the last remaining members of the Islamic State's army left the city, the representative of the group reported on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now cleaning the city following the arrival of the remaining group of fighters hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilians who were detained by the fighters, and reported to the Reiter, Charfan Darvis, a federal military council SDS from Manbage.
"It's good now under our control, but we're doing clean-up operations," he told the Reater agency.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax statements on Friday, which showed that the candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in charity contributions, mainly to the Clinton Fund, which was the former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in the form of statements, and the former State Secretary stated that it had received $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her position in the State Department.
The potential Vice-President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Cain of Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton, published tax statements for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillar Clinton and Tim Cain continue to set a standard of financial transparency," said President Clinton Jennifer Palmer in his statement.
On the contrary, Donald Tramp is hiding behind separate justifications and violates his previous promises to publicize his tax declarations.
This is an ordinary case for candidates in the Presidents of the United States to publish their tax statements, although the law does not require them.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called for the verification of the State Tax Service as a reason for his refusal to publish his tax statements.
"Your move," wrote Clinton Jan Sams, former presidential adviser to Twitter, in the form of a candidate from the Democratic Party's declaration.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trampa Michael Coen told CNN that it would not allow Trampa to issue them until the end of the inspection.
The Critics of Trapa, including the candidate from the Republican Party in 2012, said that his rejection raised questions about his status, his voluntary contributions, his business operations and other links, including with Russia.
Clinton was caught up in this issue and released an online video on Friday, which focused on the issuing Republicans who had convinced Trapa to generate tax accounts.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during economic discussions in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what everyone has done without exception to the presidential candidates for decades: to make their tax statements," she said to the Assembly.
The Politico newspaper reported that Trump had not paid any or almost no taxes in the 1990s, and the New York Times business inspector had prosecuted many tax lawyers and waiters on Friday.
The federal tax rates have become a subject of debate in the presidential elections.
Clinton supported a rule called the billionaire, investor Warren Buffett, which would guarantee that people with more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barak Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, where the Berkshire Hataway Conglomerate is based there, Trampu proposed to meet and exchange tax statements.
Buffett said he was also under IRS verification, and that Trap was fighting not by tax agencies but by voters.
The Presidential headquarters of Clinton published tax declarations by 2007.
Clintons who are now living in Chappaqua, New York, have paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective total tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The 2015 Clinton Declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was the low-cost index fund, and Clinton declared dividends and capital income of $109,000.

Conservatives with chili and fibers enhance the protection of dance elephants
In Tanzania, environmental fighters are using a non-traditional approach to trap elephants in populated areas, where they are bombarded by fossil fuels.
The method was effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came to mind a few years ago, along with the American Nature Protection Committee, took its move to train volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use the non-violent four steps to protect their homes and settlements without harming their animals.
Many used to use copies to protect themselves.
On Friday will be the World Day for the Protection of Animals.
"Since we have created a set of instruments ..., we observe the change in the relationship within these communities, so they are more confident that they will not be able to leave elephants on their fields without causing injuries," said Executive Director Honeyguide Damian Bell.
The first two steps shall be in the fire of the case before the breach of the floor and the signal by means of the hole.
If he couldn't get away with it, they're wearing what's called "the chili dress."
The cheese cheese mixed with the soil is placed with a boy in a condom, and his end is closed, and only phytilization remains.
When the fuel is incinerated, it is stuck with a hole, spraying a small hole in the air.
One donation is usually enough to distribute money on the other.
The final measure is the explosive device that shoots Roman lights in the air, producing a warm, bright explosion.
In Turkey, 32 Turkish diplomats have not yet returned, leaving the country after the governorate's attempt in July of this year.
Such data led Turkey's MID head, Meluta Chavushoglu, to a discussion with local journalists.
At the first stage, we picked up 208 staff diplomats to continue their work at the center.
32 of them did not return without objective reasons and explanations," the head of the Turkish Foreign Office said.
We remember that an attempt to reform the state took place in Turkey in July.
The authorities officially stated that the governor had failed and reported more than six thousand arrests, including high and medium- and military acts.
As a result of his attempt, 290 persons were killed, according to the Turkish MID.
The Jewish director strongly criticised the Berlin Hotel for removing Israel ' s telephone code on the Arab ' s "demand" — reporting RT News channel
The French director of Jewish origin conducted a survey in the media, discovering that Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have a list of Israel ' s telephone code, so the officials refer to "demons" by Arab clients.
Claude Lanzman, author of the documentary film about the Holocaust "Shoa", expressed his disappointment at the Kempinski Bristol department in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAQ.
During his recent stay at the Lanzman Hotel, he tried to find Israel on the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among States where it could be called directly from the room.
How was it possible that in Berlin, the capital of New Germany, Israel would be eliminated and eliminated in 2016?
Written by Lanceman.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to collect Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In the search for explanations, the director raised this issue at the level of the department of the hospital.
The answer he got there, according to Lanzman, was "shocking him."
Clerk of the Hospital said that this measure was "a deliberate decision to run the Kempinski Hotel Network."
The reason for this step was the greater anger of the director.
“Most of our Arab guests, and they needed Israel's code to be removed,” Lanzman, a hospital servant, said.
Israel's Ambassador to Germany Jacob Hadas-Handelsman called the case "a terrible sight," reports Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were hit and shocked by the incident.
It's, in fact, a terrible sight.
What happened in Germany and in this network of hotels is even more visible.
There's no need for explanations here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," said the officer.
The case has led to a slight resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that Kempinski's hotel simply "goed for the cause" to the alleged requirements of Arab clients.
"They'd be left," said another post, where it was shown that the hotel located on the famous Kurfurstendamm street is in line with the synagogue.
The hotel itself has been quick to dismiss any charges, calling what happened "unexamined" and "appropriate" before Lanzman, reports the newspaper Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order for Israel to be included in the quick list," quoted the representative of Kempinski, Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use sessotic gas and repellent bullets against protesting Brazilian students
The students met with the police in the Brazilian city of San Paulo on Thursday to protest against government reforms in the public education system.
The police used retroactive gas and retinal pulses against protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to intimidate the students, resulting in the use of resinful pulses and sly gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their concerns about plans.
According to the Government of San Paulo Geraldo Alckmin's proposals, nearly 100 public secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redistributiond to save money.
Some of the protest participants could be seen writing on the walls of the charts aimed at the temporary performance of President Michael Temer.
This last protest took place a few days after mass protests went into the streets to support foreign President Dilmu Rusef when the country's Senate voted for her impotence.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 per cent - reporting RT Business Portal
With the abolition of sanctions, the supply gap between Moscow and Tegeran increased by 70.9 per cent compared with the previous year, according to the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Lebanon Jagarjan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the increase of interest has been observed by Russian business companies in the country.
Russian companies are re-connected with Iran and new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Jagaryan said.
He noted that, in the first five months of 2016, the supply gap between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent over the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade has been achieved through the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” said the Ambassador.
Jagaryan also predicts that this year Russia will visit a record number of Iranian tourists.
Last year, Russia's diplomatic mission in Iran issued some 35,000 visas, mainly for tourists, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran entered the top 20 countries on the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It can be said with confidence that an annual record of the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be killed," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, which is expected to change.
"I personally recommend that you visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Jed, where the memory of ancient Persian civilization remains in good condition," he said.
The State continues to block obstacles to the defence-industrial complex.
As a result of the detonation, the "systematic failure" of the orders of the director of the Almas-Antei concert, "incessment" and "indebted trust".
For the next three years, the heads of NGOs have been appointed by Gennadi Banderski.
The information on the release of Nekorodov was only received on Thursday night and did not give rise to a broad resonance in the media.
What can be explained by such silence under the terms of the arms embargo?
In short, the leadership of the IMF does not want any hearings or negative public opinion.
This time, it has been confirmed that there are many problems in the defence-industrial complex (OPC) and that the State does not want to draw greater attention to it by society.
The removal of Uncorodov is certainly an important event from the point of view of order in the industry.
NGO Almaz is the main enterprise of a concert specializing in the production of Zentene-Ratite complexes (CPCs) of the sea and land base.
Almaz is currently working on the creation of the Polyment Redut and Morphey CR, which is planning to set up new curves,
The founder of the military port Russia Dmitri Cornev believes that the release of the Uncorroded is due to the deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical one.
For example, the development of Morphea began in 2007, and the entry into force was expected in 2013.
The RED shall become the main PWO system on new FMF ships.
According to the information I receive, no trials have been carried out in a few years.
True, as far as I can judge, there's no such thing as "Almas," Cornev said.
The expert is afraid that delays in the operation may also occur with the C-500 CR.
The pilot-building work on the project has not yet been completed, but the first kits will be admitted to the army during 2016.
In Minoboron, it is believed that "work is under way and will be completed within a set time period", although in 2014 the public recognized that there were problems with the development of C-500.
Finally, it is difficult to assess the professional qualities of Nekorodov, led by Almas since 2011.
The Cornev noted that project schedules could be both a cause and a cause of delay.
In his view, it has been extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in OPC and business management plans.
The industry has received long - term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and large amounts of money, of course, love silence.
As a rule, the directors of defence companies are either from their own will or from the agreement of the parties or are transferred to another work.
In this case, the removal was public, although it was not justified.
This suggests that Almasa's manager may have been a figure of stroptic and opposed to the “diversity”.
In all, it is no longer intended for a State to be at peace with such conduct.
It will remove from the hands of shareholders those who prefer to dispute with the Minoboron facilities and do not fulfil the tasks they have been assigned.
At the same time, the leadership of the RF seeks to punish the proven managers (the machines on the "Stars").
The president paid particular attention to the sector's problems.
Vladimir Putin led the Military Industrial Commission and held regular meetings on arms transfers.
The Kremlin protects a number of OPC managers in an effort to maintain a loyal composition of directors, which will carry out the above-mentioned arrangements.
This is far from an ideal policy, but on the basis of corruption and lack of regular competition in other instruments in the OPCE, there are no other instruments in the State.
The situation in the defence, of course, is not catastrophic but the current geopolitical situation encourages Kremlin as soon as possible to conduct armed forces.
In parallel with the "cleaning" of OPC managers, the RF leadership is taking full steps to improve the professionalism of the Russian forces.
The military team has acquired a new quality with the entry into office of Minister of Defence Sergey Shug.
The impression is that the President has taken on arms the famous "Would-be peace" talk.
During the cold war, the military force of the SSR and the nuclear party achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which strengthened the continent ' s impact on Moscow.
In all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it was fully effective.
The absence of war on the European continent and relatively stable situation in the Middle East has been demonstrated.
The trade in “victors” in the cold war resulted in the strengthening of international terrorism.
After the series of tracts in Europe and the United States in "civilized world," please, there is no peaceful corner left.
Despite the general poverty, the West refuses to speak with Russia at the level of the same partner.
In such circumstances, our country's only allies remain fleet and army.
The strengthening of military power will make Moscow more effective to withdraw national interests and to move on to new world policies.
Scotland's Callum Skinner's dying at the end of the day, so the British take the gold of the bicycle
Scotland's Kallum Skinner went to the triumph in a man's command line at the train station in Rio last night, resulting in the protection of his title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Glago was in the role of his best friend, Sir Chris Hoy, who made himself his own friend, and the young pride came into history, struggling at the finish line in order to win a victory in New Zealand's charity team.
Britain declared the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, won when Hoy declared the right to a fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the race, after they had been humbly funded by six at the March World Championship on Road Railways in London, despite the fact that Hoy had since finished his career.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of the participant's specialist, Jamie Staff.
They did the same thing once when the Hindus appeared.
Hoya also created the desert that Kean Emmadi and Matt Crempton were trying to fill.
Skinner was a man with British coaches who saw the potential in Scotland that was now realized.
Hendez, Kenny, champions with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner set up an Olympic record of qualifications, but the rules were passed on to New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a gold medal.
Hendes was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported it.
The change of the strategy was a major part of the transformation where Hendez was on the move in order to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy saw from his position as an invited BBC expert and took a look at Skinner, Kenny and Hendez when they entered the pendant.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "This is a forest comparison."
I'm here to do my best and make my own name.
We set up an Olympic record at the end and won the peace championships.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012 along with Kenny and Hoy, Hendes admitted that he had fallen into a course after a failed start.
It later withdrew from the comment and was not able to appeal by UK competitors.
There was no such issue this time in the greatest victory.
Hendes said, "I felt like London, with all these British flags on the throne."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We lost so many world-class races that winning the Olympics again was just boring.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country that won seven of the 10 so-called races, both in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, the bike will wait five more days.
With the form displayed by Kenny, it is not beyond the ability to imagine how it repeats Hoya's foot, winning three Olympic gold medals in one Game.
This would allow you to see how Kenny, who was born on March 23, at the age of 12, is bringing her account to six gold medals and one silver silver medal.
It'd be like Hoa's.
The next time, Kenny is in a hurry, which starts today and is played for three days.
A 28-year-old visitor from Bolton said, "I'm just having fun right now.
Command meetings are always the best.
You're coming to win with your friends.
It's a little lonely to win one if it's fair.
Hendes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must get kingdom."
It was the only day of medals, but there were the following good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Kulsey, Steven Berk and Owen Doll are best qualified for the four-mile-long command line.
They've been funded by 3:51,943.
The world record set at the 2012 gold prize in London is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (10:42 evening) will be held today, on the second day of the event where Wiggins will be precisely at the centre of attention.
He had a discussion with the Commissioners yesterday, a delay in qualifying travel when officials needed him to measure his weight.
In the relevant women ' s event, which is resumed and completed tomorrow, Laura Trottt, Joanna Russell Shend, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milnguvia improved the world record, showing time 4:13.260.
The British Command has come to rely on a powerful crew of bicycle passengers to take over the middle of the Olympic Games and to hire a dog of medals.
After the extraordinary demonstrations of full superiority in Beijing and London, expectations were weakened in progressive preparation for Rio.
There were dramas on the second level, not the last of which was the attention of technical director Shane Satton in April due to allegations of sexism and anxiety, and the concerns of major figures, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, based on the first night's ride on the bike, it is said that Britain's legendary glory is now at the right time, perhaps once again.
Future Portland metallurgy plant at risk of breaking the contract into electricity
The future Portland Aluminum plant in Victoria, as well as hundreds of jobs, is threatened by the fact that the electricity company providing the factory, according to one of its owners, is planning to break the supply contract: all supply contracts are planned to be broken.
This is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years is due in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs can be threatened by Alcoa in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — can occur in the risk zone as a result of any closure.
Additional side effects can also be seen as the metallurgy industry consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the metallurgy plant at Point Henry, which led to the closure of the power station in England last year.
The Portland metallurgy company Alcoa loses money and is at risk of closing.
These actions have been the result of thinking about the future of a company that has been for several years, which is due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar and later due to the price of the factory ' s production.
The AGL company, which provides a large aluminium power plant with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrov Valley, reported that it is expected that three other owners will also take steps to break the contract.
The controlled portion of the company belongs to the joint short-term company Alcoa and Aluminum, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubien Corp is less than the share.
"AGL company expects the Portland facility to continue working, namely that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgy firm will not cease," she said.
According to AGL, the contracts mentioned are so-called 'held contracts' that were to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month period of disengagement, so they actually end in 2017.
"In turn, AGL still expects that these contracts will bring its share of income in 2017 in the financial year," said the electricity company.
Whatever the potential impact on AGL's profit since 2018 of the financial year has now been limited by the forecasts for the strong market for electricity prices.
The AGL company stated that it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its accounts to $187 million in the form of a “pronouncement”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to cancel contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to manage a metallurgy plant or to provide electricity to a metallurgy plant”.
The American company stated that in 2010 it had entered into a two-year contract with Loy Yang, which was due to enter into force in November of this year, but it still had to explain why it had broken the contract.
The analysts feared possible closure of both the Portland metallurgy plant in Victoria and the Tomago factory along with Newcastle because of the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL CEO Steven Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megabytes of energy per year and that Togo is about 900 megabytes per year.
If both companies leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [e.g. electricity].
It will be bad for us as for the manufacturer," he said.
Not only the star of the Cardassian show, Candall on September's Vogue number.
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, the model and fourth daughter of the Cardadian-Gener mother manager Chris, appeared on the lead cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Candall, who is the face of the East Lauder brand and has been defied for weeks of fashion in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in his account in Instagram on Thursday.
"When I was in the room with my dear people, I looked at this apartment and cried," wrote Kendal.
The news of the scene was strange (or simply in the spirit of the Cardadian Family?), a video reality in which all the Cardadian-Jenner families (debossers Rob and Kathleen, also their most beloved business grandparents, the Kardawan family producer Ryan Sikrest), forgot about the appearance of the sister on the board and at the end of the classic turn: they planned a party party.
This is the standard news line for almost all the events of the children's television show on the day of birth (Sikrest says: "You think we've forgotten about you?" with the honesty of the multi-pronged queen from the program on 8 a.m.), but Chris needed it to be this way or otherwise for other girls.
Because with this episode of September's Vogue, we undoubtedly entered a new era of Cardassian show.
Let older sister Kendall Kim fall into Vogue earlier (she appeared with her husband Kanya Westom in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine was a personal achievement.
The September issue is the most sold issue of Vogue per year.
The volume is similar to the tax release rather than the fashion magazine, which attracted a large number of advertisers (according to the Fashionist port, 615 pages from last year's 832 page).
The news of those who fall from the star to its surface is expected to be so impatient that in the last two years, the photograph of the magazine has come down to the official anonymity.
Among the previous women who fell on the floor were Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has been, of course, more "manifests who work as models" than "models who are nominals".
Laurent Oskar and Brande Dior Jennifer Lawrence were presented on board in 2013, a year after Lady Gage won this prize.
But even in that rare case, if Jenner, who described the magazine as a “extending model” of his generation, falls into the first category, she is in a bad company.
These characteristics are not family members of known people, real-world stars or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (which is what Jenner falls into these categories).
These are truly talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
For Beonse, which appeared on the last floor last year, this year was one of the most successful careers in the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course, not all are happy with the success of Jenner.
The situation of Jenner in the world of fashion, given her past TV reality stars, had always been shocking.
In June one of Victoria's Secret Seymour's first models criticised Jenner and her colleague, Jiji Hadid, calling them "the shocks of the moment".
These trends were resounded after the news of the appearance of Jenner on Vogue.
But it doesn't make sense to go around.
Candall Jenner on the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in all the sense of this word.
She's defiesting for Mark Jacobs.
She'll sell you tonne cream from the East Lauder.
She, though, and all her sisters, sell their photos to you in their own applications that are available on the payroll.
It sells photos of the daughter of Cindy Crowford in Lovee's magazine.
And in free time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she's taking part in a TV show.
Public legal centres refuse to serve 160,000 people per year
Each year more than 160,000 minimum protection representatives refuse to serve in public legal centres, as this sector is preparing for an effect which will lead to further cuts in funding and thus lead to activities beyond the scope.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mainly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, people who are unable to fight the injustice of property and so on — have already been denied free legal assistance and representation.
The public legal services already operating outside of the capacity are being further reduced.
Since June the following year, these legal centres have lost more than 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of the Public Legal Centres of Queensland, James Farrell, said that, according to the last census of the National Association of Public Legal Centres, thousands of people were already denied annually.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision was not cancelled, the situation would only deteriorate.
“The main legal centres in Queensland have always received insufficient funding, which means that thousands of people are being denied the essential services they need,” he said.
People who are victims of violent relationships, people with uncontrollable and divisive debt, families who are victims of divorce, victims of unfair work — all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot receive the help they need.
The federal Government will fund 30 per cent since June 2017, which means that thousands of less protected people in Queensland will be forced to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call upon the Minister of Justice and Senator of Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately cancel these cuts in order to enable people to receive the necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
Last year, the Government had fulfilled its commitment to raise free legal assistance to the country ' s average indicator.
It is now time to draw attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients and the Government of Palachok as soon as possible for this important work.
Donald Trampa was put in court at the pre-election table after allegedly threatened by a gunman.
According to reports from New York, Donalda Trappa was placed in court at the pre-election headquarters: it is believed that the headquarters had nothing to do with the announcement that its operating director in North Carolina threatened the gunman when they were on the deck in February.
The incident was described in a court case in the middle of the State court in Charlotte Vincent Bordini, former programme instructor at the pre-trial level.
Bordini said he had waited several months for an internal solution, but he realized that "it wouldn't happen."
Director Erl Phillip "takes a gun, puts his right index finger on the hook and makes a hole in the Winsent's knee pocket," says Bordine in the complaint.
Appealing to the local and regional management of the pre-election table, Bordini understood that at least four other persons had been involved in similar incidents with Philip.
"The guns don't have to shoot for damage," Bordine said in her complaint.
The search took place two days after a candidate from the president of the Republican party produced a forum, told the audience in North Carolina that "People of the Second Amendment" — understood as owners of arms and their loved ones — could begin to act if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, was elected and could elect judges.
The President-in-Office of Trapa said that the media had removed his words from the context and that he had not expressed support for violence.
In its complaint, Bordini calls for compensation from the pre-election table for non-interference control and from the Philippines for the threat of physical violence, abuse of action and the cause of moral damage.
The representative of Trapa Hope Hicks Medlit responded to the request for comments.
The attempts to communicate with Philip failed.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Philip recently left the front desk.
In response to the call to his consultancy firm, the Innovative Advisory Services have not been called upon.
The candidate, as president of the Republican Party, Donald Trump, conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Division of the Supreme Court of the District of Mecklenburg (Charlot).
Britain must send the Olympic Spirit to the necessary root and expand Hitler
It will also bring about recovery and prosperity not only in our beautiful settlements and in general in London, but throughout the country.
As I believe, this was the great advantage of Hitler, just as it was with London 2012, where we have made every effort to benefit our peoples and regions from the Games.
The Olympic Games have benefited greatly from Stratford and East India.
And we're doing this again, creating opportunities for local residents and a company with Hitler.
Only for our present population, we will create 10,000 new posts, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
As in the case of London 2012, there will be those who think that Hitler's expansion is too large.
I was told that Britain will never be ready for the Olympic Games, and that we are in a difficult position in the world.
Skeptics failed in 2012, and will prove them wrong about Hitler.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Hitler is responsible for any issue he has raised.
Like the Olympic Games of Hitler, it is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for a short circle.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion dollars of economic growth, leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a beautiful team in Hitrou, which has implemented the 11 billion-pound infrastructure investment programme at the time and within the budget, from T5, selected by the best airport terminal five years ago, to T2, built among the two world ' s most recent field.
They are now ready to provide a third summer-end course approved by 16 billion private investment funds.
The Olympic Games in London 2012 were a great success for Britain, and I am confident that the expansion of Hitler will also be.
It is time for us to send the Olympic Spirit to the necessary root and expand Hitler by ensuring our trade future and by building up the skills and jobs that Britain can pride.
Lord Paul Dayton, President of the Council of Hitler and former Trade Attasha of Kafija
Adblock Plus, Facebook plays in "Bow Box" about blocking advertising
For companies that earn money on the Internet advertising, attempts to use software to block advertising are a game in "smokers", according to one of the companies that create such software.
On Thursday, a few days after Facebook announced that it was going to block advertising blockers on its desktop version, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users can update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the website's version would change the circle around its advertising so that the advertising blockers would find it more difficult to identify which parts of the page were advertising.
But Adblock now says he could enter a new code.
In his blog Adblock Ben Williams, he wrote that "this kind of mutual struggle between the community of blockers with an open source code and those who are trying to block it will continue from the time it was created," and that Facebook will present its own decision in the near future.
The fact that the largest social network in the world has been involved in the fight is clear evidence of how serious the problem has become an advertising blocker for industry.
Around the world, about 200 million people are using advertising blockers, according to the Pagefair and Adobe study last year; almost four times the number of those who used such software in 2013.
Taking into account 1.3 billion active users per day on Facebook via mobile devices, the mobile advertising is now 84 per cent of Facebook revenue from advertising.
However, the company is encouraged to block advertising on the desktop version, as mobile advertising blockers are not effective in mobile Facebook applications for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
However, the advertising in the desktop version is an income-effective article in order for Facebook to take such a step as a good investment.
On Thursday, Facebook also announced that it is planned to update its "advertising preferences" tool to give people more control over how advertising is being placed on them.
On Thursday, Facebook said that new Adblock filters are causing anxiety, as they will also block some unannounced content on the site.
"It will not be a positive experience for people, and we are planning to address this problem," said the representative of Facebook in an official e-mail.
Advertising blockers are a gross tool, so instead we focused on creating tools such as advertising preferences to transfer control to people.
A woman was transferred to a Swiss highway in an attempted suicide episode
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after several vehicles were transferred to the road early on Thursday morning in a public suicide attempt.
The incident occurred on A1 in the canton at noon on Thursday.
A woman was on her way in the darkness of deep despair, and several vehicles hit her, reported to the police in a statement.
Several vehicles, including the truck, were hit by a suicide victim, a Swiss woman 49 years old.
She died somewhere.
Several involved leaders have already been questioned, but the identity of some has not yet been established, the police have reported calling on them and anyone else who was a witness to the event.
A criminal case, a "logical" step in this situation, was raised by counsel Jille Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is still necessary to clarify whether any of the leaders involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid the hit?
This is what the prosecutor should determine," Hoffsetter said.
Two other similar cases over the last five years have led to the assumption that leaders will not be recognized as responsible.
In each case, both of whom are involved in the traffic darkness, it was pronounced that car drivers could not expect an accident on the road during the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, an officer was convicted of killing an innocent person after she hit and killed a man who was on A1 at Payern's way down the night of August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim was drunk and lost consciousness on the road, listening to the court.
The court found that a police woman who had responded to an emergency had managed a vehicle that had been justified and that man's presence on the road was “very exceptional and unpredictable”, the judge said.
Any person who has information on the event in the fourth row of the Sea should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venezuela was once dedicated
Venus, perhaps, was once dedicated, according to the assessment of the new NASA climate model.
Students from the Institute of Outer Space Research developed a model for research in the past of Venezuela using instruments and algorithms similar to those used by climatelogists.
The model was designed to determine whether it could be found in Vienna with its hot waterless surface and atmosphere overloaded with carbon dioxide whenever conditions such as soil exist.
The students previously assumed that the small speed of the return of Venezuela was due to its extensive atmosphere.
But the latest model suggests that Venera could probably have a dissolved atmosphere like that, and it would be all right to go back slowly.
The model also considered the early Venetian topography.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on Earth, but at one time there was enough water and sufficient geographical variation to create conditions for life and prevent rapid recovery.
Early Venezuela also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent of the population.
"In accordance with the GISS model, the slow return of Venus is nearly two months away from its daily sun," explained a press release from GISS by Anthony Del Henio.
It warms the surface of the planet and produces rain that creates a deep layer of clouds that acts as a zone that protects the surface of the planet from the material part of the sun's heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are, as we shall see, at a few degrees colder than in our day on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development that was previously proposed by planetary scientists.
Despite the fact that Venera may have been dedicated for several billion years, she was affected by too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans were drained and its watery couple were excavated by ultraviolet radiation.
When her water flowed down, only a superheated atmosphere from carbon dioxide left with a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venera, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venezuelan climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy leaves Avalanche's trainer post
Patrick Roy left trainer and vice-president of the hockey movement Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, referring to the lack of influence during the team decision-making process.
The Executive Vice-President / Chief Coordinating Team, Jo Sakik, confirmed the news and noted that the club would begin looking for a new trainer immediately.
"For the past three years, I have been carrying out my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice-President of the hockey activities of Colorado Avalanche with energy, stress and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
Over the course of the summer, I had been thinking seriously about how I could improve this command to give her the depth she needed and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice-president of hockey activities must be ideally aligned with the vision of the organization.
It should also have the right to vote in decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions are not fulfilled at this time.
Sakik, who won Roya on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patric told me about his decision today," said Sakik.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we want it to succeed in the future.
Roy became a graduate of the Jack Adams Award as the best league trainer during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led a club to 112 eyes and won in the Central Division, but Colorado was disintegrated in the first round of playoffs and played playoffs for the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced an assessment of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and left the Wild team in the fight for a second useful route to participate in the Western Conference.
A doorkeeper from the Hall of Slavs, Roy won four Cups of Stanley — two with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oilmakers resume negotiations and stop delay
The oil cuts were suspended in the North Sea, and all the parties to the discussion started a new round of negotiations, reported by the leading representatives of the parties.
Deployment against the oil service company Wood Group was organized on platforms in the North Sea at Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Union and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve current disputes," said the joint statement.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting from the beginning of the following week to look at the problems with a fresh perspective.
The trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first over 25 years old, was directed against potential cuts in wages of up to 30 per cent.
This year, the Wood Group reduced the rates paid to contract workers working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent due to the negative market pressure.
The decrease in rates by the company occurred after a 10 per cent reduction in rates for marketed contractors in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions will provide it with the space needed to overcome market decline.
The Shell company, by its side, has reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop the oil activities in the countries by up to 10 as it rationalizes its activities due to its mega-fire from the British Energy Company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the lower prices on unpolluted oil: the economic situation has deteriorated because of the decision to leave the European Union, which was adopted in June by the United Kingdom.
Scotland's member, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major labour conflicts that have occurred in the North Sea in our time.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, yes, throughout the country, we need an economy that would work for the majority, not just for some," he said.
Less than $1.4 billion for new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with the average value of approximately $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the return of the star to the Plead.
The last mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers to collect the most complete directory of the speeds of the return of the Pleed stars.
New data help astronomers understand why stars are returning at different speeds, as well as how the periods of return relate to the formation of the planet.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of stars, its age and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Riball, a scientist at the Centre for Infrared Treatment and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Pleed harvest is in 445 light years from the Earth.
Many of the constellations are now only growing up; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're coming back as fast as they'll never be again.
At their peak speed of return, these growing stars emit a large amount of star wind.
With the passing of magnetic fields of stars, these winds are at the helms of the stars.
As the stars get older, it's going to slow down.
The Kepler measures the speed of each star’s return, followed by the time between the appearance of known stars — such as the sun’s rays.
The new speeds catalogue suggests that more massive stars return slowly than smaller massive stars.
Riball compares the stars to dancers: the pirates do more slowly than the smaller.
"In the "Balate" Play we see that those who return slowly are usually more massive than those who return faster are usually referred to as very easy stars," said Ribal.
As the Plead is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparison of its properties with the speed of return.
"The Playadi constellation provides a starting point for the theoretical models of the return of the star, both young and older," says Ribal.
We still want to know how, where and why the stars slow down their return and hang on their "tancival tufts" on board, I say.
Riball and her colleagues presented their latest analysis of the speed of the return of the Pleed in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomy magazine.
An investigation into the activities of a group of Ukrainian dispersants detained in Crimea is conducted by two departments, writes Commersant.
The FSB collects evidence of participation of detainees in the preparation of differences in Crimea.
As noted earlier, the Ukrainian city's residents, Energodar Evgen Panov, agreed to cooperate with the result.
According to him, he considered the Titanium in Armenia, the Petroleum in Fedos, the Kertan paradigm transfer, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military aerodromes.
Lawyers believe that arrests have taken place far away from all the dividends.
This, in particular, served as a basis for arrests of suspects in the Kyiv District of Simferopol.
Stanislav Cherchesov was the main trainer of the Russian football team
At the meeting of the Russian Football Union, a decision was taken to appoint the Chief Trainer of the Russian Federation on the Stanislav Chercesov Football.
The contract will be considered for two years before the end of the CM-2018.
On 11 August, the RFS was appointed Chief Trainer of the Russian Federation on the Stanislav Chercesov football team.
He was a well-known footballer who had previously played in Moscow Spartaque at the victor's position, as well as a solid coach who was the teacher of the same Russian team as Spartacus, Žemchugina-Sochi, Terek, Amcar, Dinamo, and the Warsaw League, who became the winner of the national sovereignty and the country's Cup.
It is reported that the contract with Cherques will be signed in the nearest time and will be counted for two years.
Thus, it is his duty to prepare for the 2018 World Championship.
It is known that Miroslav Romastánko, Gintaras Stuche, Vladimir Pannikov, will be at his train station.
There is information on which the total salary of the train station will amount to 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to the media, the leadership of the RFS has set before Stanislav the objective of bringing Russia together into the semifinal and to conquer the medals.
As the trainer himself stated, he considered the creation of a competitive environment in the team and was going to give football players the opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Cherches, he's glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of the Church of Russia will be held on 31 August in Antalye, which will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Remember, the former position of the Chief Trainer of the Russian Football Association, Leonid Slucky, met him at the CSCA Club.
He stated his concern at the post following the failure of the Russian national team to Euro-2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the bad results of his collection.
In the struggle between Angola and the UAR, Namibia suffered greatly during a long struggle against apartheid.
Nevertheless, after the fall of South Africa independence in 1990, this country, with its population of 2.4 million, has achieved enormous success, especially in recent years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success is that the Government is paying great attention to education.
While people in developed countries recognize themselves as self-evident free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries in middle and even primary schools, education is required.
Moreover, Governments are often advised to provide training for “cost recovery”.
In Namibia, however, primary schools are free.
Moreover, there has been free secondary education since 2015.
The authorities are also active in other important areas.
Malaria-destruction efforts have reduced the number of annual cases of disease by 97 per cent over the last ten years.
Despite the international trend of inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
Compared to the 1993 indicator, the Gini factor, which was the standard indicator of inequality in income distribution, fell to 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty level fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) has also declined from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest rate of freedom of speech in Africa, according to the Reporters Without Borders data.
The country has made a significant contribution to the United States and other rich States.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the Index of Anti-Corruption, composed of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now when prices fall, Namibia is able to maintain a high rate of growth.
At the same time, the debt ratio for GDP is about 25 per cent, which is less than 1.3 per cent of debt in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The level of unemployment, at least by traditional assessment methods, remains quite high - almost 28 per cent.
Like other countries in the region, the high level of HIV/AIDS in Namibia is nearly 17 per cent of the population.
According to the World Bank, Namibia refers to the number of countries with income above the average, but authorities insist that their State is actually a developing country.
Namibia, of course, faces some of the challenges facing the poor economies.
The State has to develop a very large and dry country with a small population.
In the territory of the countries in the desert, isolated herds of hunters live, which must otherwise be integrated into the modern society without losing their identity.
Integration of people who have been in the world economy for the past four centuries is a challenge for any country.
This is even more difficult for Namibia: like any other country in the world, it is facing the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia did not intend to let its hands down, but the country faced the problem.
Almost immediately after the fall of independence, the authorities were involved in the creation of a diverse economy and a shared society.
It is noteworthy that the competing political groups were gathered together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides adequate medical care not only for its own citizens but also for its neighbors.
About 15-20 per cent of visitors to the medical institutions in the northern areas of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia speaks of building a wall that would separate the country from poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibians realized that their neighbours did not choose, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate with their water resources, participate in regional health projects, encourage investment and exchange of students.
In addition, the Government of Namibia had rightly argued that the rich natural resources could easily become a curse, contributing to the well-being of many.
The authorities understand that Namibia's natural wealth income needs to be invested in infrastructure and productive power.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum income from the country ' s sale of resources, and review investment laws and contracts for profit in order to make sure that they are.
Transparency is crucial for this process, so strong support for the Government for freedom of speech is so important.
As the head of the Hague Hengbo State has pointed out, media often say that he does not like it.
But after fighting for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it has gained, the President says.
Not all Namibia ' s key resources are insufficient.
Some, such as fisheries, are subject to re-establishment, and the Government is making every effort to maintain and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country each year.
Namibia shows that even countries that start with serious shortcomings - racism, colonialism, inequality and low levels of development - can be on the way to overall growth.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and support.
Many have heard of the Golden Varna, the oldest gold objects made by man (4600 - 4200 B.C.E.).
Please, this was the most serious archaeological sensation in the 1970s: in Bulgaria, at the ruins of Varnish Necropolis, a fantastic amount of gold artifacts were found — more than three thousand pounds [6 kg] in total.
Only one burial known as "Mogilla No. 43" was pulled out of 990 gold items weighing more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the former gold of the world can soon turn into an inexhaustible type of bus discovered by archaeologists in July of this year.
We're going back to Bulgaria - in a dostoric settlement known as the Tel Unitite.
Unlike Varna, the port city, the Tel Unazites are located at sea, up the village of the Union of the Pazardic region.
The bus is a gold plate turned into a ring.
Yavor Bejajiev, leader of the excavation at Tel Aviv, dated 4600 B.C.E. to our era and stated that it was the oldest of Varna's gold for at least 200 years.
Varna's remains are remembered for about the same period, from 4600 to 4400 B.C.E. to our summer.
There are no technologies that can accurately date metals at present.
Where's your confidence in what gold is earlier?
Professor Bejajiev knows more than Reuters reported: "I am absolutely convinced that the gold of the Union is older than the gold of Varna."
This is an emergency: this is a minor matter, but it is much more important to take a place in history.
In an interview, Reuters Bejajiev reported that scientists are currently analysing the composition of metal, as well as re-examined and more closely the archaeological layer where gold artifacts were found.
This will help to date the bus as accurately as possible.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tel unacitate is a famous village, even if you've never heard of it.
The Tel Unit is now considered Europe's oldest "city".
Tel was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (now Turkey) in the seventh millennium B.C.E.
During the following centuries, metal processing in the region has been highly developed from the development of the first metallurgy skills to the establishment of a fully-valued industry.
There is a special name in the native history of this archaeological community: the Balkans-Carpathian metallurgy province.
In five thousand years before our era, the city-type settlements began to exist around the metal processing centers.
They are now called the ancient cities of Europe.
One of these may be the oldest, since artefacts were found here in 4400 B.C.E.
I would call Tel Unitite a prototype of the modern city, although it is a very ancient village, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This is the place of the older Shomer for a thousand years," said Bejajiev, bearing in mind the general opinion that urban culture was born in southern Mesopotamia -- modern Iraq.
There were the first cities in the common sense of this word.
The Tela unacitte has been excavated since 1976.
At the time, archaeologists have dug nearly 12 acres [12 ha], about a third of the estimated general area of the settlement.
The rest of the wall was found, which once reached three meters high.
From home and master, however, archaeologists clearly distinguish streets, public buildings, urban flat building, "work centre" and residential areas.
Tel unacitutes are often called "The Bird City," where dozens of winged birds have been found.
All birds are represented in the room, from which they were assumed not to be decorative objects but to the object of local culture.
"The city of birds" was destroyed about 4400 B.C.E. by the Indian tribes coming from the north-east.
There were no cities, so there were evils and weapons.
The three-metre wall did not stop them.
The archaeologists discovered signs of brutal warfare: the remains of the elderly, women, and children were found in their homes with wounds caused by wars.
New findings and new facts appear each year, and I am familiar with the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are still talking, not about certain cultures, but about the "poterane" of Europe's first civilization born in the Balkans.
A strong incentive for this civilization was the "Golden Varna", recently found in 1972.
It's reasonable that the gold rose Varna should have been something to go forward -- some kind of a little gold bus created in Tel Unita.
In Porsche, the model 911 Targa was artificially grown
It was officially stated that preparation of 911 Target 4S Exclusive Design was carried out by manual unit specialists working with serial machines.
Retro-luct, for example, is a special color of Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for Porsche 356B models - even the logo of the model.
In addition, the market received a business white graph around ships and special 20-inch RS Spyder bicycle discs, as well as some of the details of the design of the "white-gold metallic".
In the interest of retro-quarters, it is much less significant: it is different from a large account of sero-sene gamma formation, new crests with expanded electro-regulatory areas and a separate black-adjusted table with unit logos.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a gift of tea for the car and a rich album with photographs of the production process.
The strong installation of Porsche Exclusive specialists did not become: the retro-market of characteristics is completely consistent with the series.
It consists of a six-cylinder motor with a turbundant of 3.0 l, which is developed in 420 B.C. and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version 911 Targa 4S can be speeded up to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Target 4S Exclusive Design will be issued with a limited voltage, but neither the value of each particular athlete is reported.
Facebook and advertising blockers connected the "arm race"
The recent introduction of Facebook technology, which prevented the cover of advertising on the social media pages, has provoked decision-makers to block the advertising from responding.
AdBlock Plus released "restraint", but Facebook plans to make it useless.
So AdBlock Plus announced its new technology, which will soon remain effective.
The representatives of the Socset noted that, in an attempt to deceive new "non-blocked" advertising technology, the decision of AdBlock Plus, along with commercial advertising, also blocks many regular posts from friends or sites.
On Facebook, they regretted this policy AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
As told by the source among the developers of the TechCrunch issue, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop will be ready for the next few hours.
As a result, hundreds and blockaders have joined their kind of “arm race”, trying to play another person who has been injured by the same party, who have lost interesting records from friends or who have seen advertising where they have not been accustomed to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of advertising blockade have recently raised heated arguments.
In Murmanska the rapist will appear before the court; the evening Murmansk.
His case had already been completed in the Follow-up Committee of the Russian Federation on the Murman area.
The charges against 54-year-old men are very serious - for violent sexual activity.
As a result, it was found that by the end of November 2015, the accused in the street area of Pavlova in Murmansk had committed sexual acts with violence against a 20-year-old girl. The criminal case with the alleged accused was intended for consideration.
The sanctions referred to in this article provide for the maximum penalty for deprivation of liberty for up to six years.
Dongfeng will take you to Russia Crossfenguan Fengguang 370 and pickup Rich New - Website About the Role www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the China-class pickup of cars that combine the value of mine and cruise.
Another Russian prime minister said it was a pickup Rich New.
Many Western companies of the Moscow International Autosalon have decided to ignore this year, so Chinese companies will be filled with the empty exhibition halls of the Cross Expo.
In particular, the powerful front will be the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has large types of markets in Russia and intends to offer our car lovers a number of interesting news in the near future.
One of them will be Dongfeng Fengguang 370, which has been sold in China at the price of 55,900 yuan (see less than 550,000 rubs per current course).
Whether the Russians would be aware of such a price, whether or not the issue of delivery in our country is still under discussion.
In China, however, Fengguang 370, after the June sale, reached 11th place in the list of the most sold minivans, although the large road education (175 mm) and the protective plastic cover under the lower perimeter of the cosmos can be counted as crossovers.
Crossway was built on the pre-advertising platform of the Fengguang 360 model, with the same base of 370 at 2725 mm, but the cubes heard longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), more solid design and more rich supply.
Salon was decorated with wooden tiles, but a large vertical sensor screen "as in Tesla" on the central console was only on the early crossway exhibitions, and machines with "music" were sold more easily.
Five of the seven floors are easily constructed, forming a 1650 mm load area with a maximum storage capacity of 1500 l.
The Fengguang 370 engine is equipped with a total of one-1.5-litre-benzene "atmospheric" of 115 C.C., which is connected with a 5-phase mechanical transmission box.
With regard to the dynamic quality of the machine, the manufacturer humbly reduces it, and promises the sustainable budget of the holder at 6.7 l/100 km.
Picap Rich New is well-known to the Russians Nissan NP300 Navara of the past generation, but with the attention of Chinese designers.
Despite the moral age structure, this model is still used by a stable demand for Chinese consumer as a reliable and unwieldy "working bad".
At the same price, Rich New is also interested by Russians because modern Japanese pickups have become relatively expensive.
Rich New consists of two chosen engines: petrol 2.4 l (137 ls) or turbodiesel 2.5 l (116 ls).
The transmission box is only a mechanical, adjective, on the back wheels, but there are modifications and with a hard-connected front.
There will be a stand at Dongfeng and a new Flagman seat A9, his Russian Prime Minister, the Chinese company's delegation announced it in June.
The Chinese market is becoming more and more like crossword puzzles, one of the latest newspapers - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
At present, the Russian line Dongfeng consists of two models: S30 seat and H30 cross.
In seven months of this year, 696 cars were carried out by Chinese companies.
Reports on the transport tax will cease to be sent by e-mail at www.zr.ru
The tax inspection has changed the procedure for sending notifications of property taxes.
All Russian car owners have been accustomed to years of constant scheme: by summer and autumn they receive an e-mail allowance for the last year's transport tax.
However, this year many do not.
The fact is that the tax inspection has changed the order of the citizens' notification.
Those who are registered in the "Personal Taxation Office" on the official website of nalog.ru will receive reports online.
In the inspection, these Russians were automatically identified by online users and deleted them from the standard, "bumous" consignment.
The news is spread to all owners of vehicles and mobility.
All other letters will still be received.
On the other hand, there is also the possibility of returning to the old scheme.
To do so, they would have to visit the Tax Service office in August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and comfortable.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after the presentation, when the letter will come in a few days and may be completely lost.
In addition, the number of Internet users of the tax inspection has exceeded 18 million people, which will allow the public to record a significant amount of mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is clearly insufficient to inform citizens of the change in order.
Some could be registered in the "personal office" to receive a uniform service and have long forgotten it.
These people do not receive reports by mail and, of course, fall into the category of non-payers with all the consequences.
Access to the Personal Taxation Office shall be carried out in three ways: through an account of the port of gosuslugi.ru, using an electronic signature or entry of the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained personally from any tax inspection department (independent of the place of order).
We recall that transport tax must be paid by 1 December this year.
The delivery of the notifications began in July.
The Tunisian Mercedes-Benz G class, where the achievements are aimed at achieving a very high score, is one thing in itself.
However, the controversial concept did not upset G-Power's masters who were involved in modifying Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power knows his passion for BMW cars, but nothing human to her master is strange.
Indeed, why not improve G 63-571-powered air-tank-powered cobalt and one hundredth of adhesion?
The "moscules" of the mixed "Helica" were used by the master for the benefits of opening 5,5 litres of the upper eight-star.
And here's the dynamic of the drop to a hundred has improved to an indistinct 0.1 c, and now the flying "kurpich" is capable of a five-c.
On the other hand, the average speeds of confidence are significantly better.
The speed rate is alarmed: if standard G 63 does not travel more than 210 km/h, the tunnel road with an electronic “heinik” is capable of exceeding 250 km/h.
