Why did you act like a child?
How'd the car go?
It's not the same anymore.
I'm afraid of land colours.
The situation was getting worse.

Are you coming?
Do you remember who I am?
I'd like to be with you.
Are you crazy?
You can take it with you.
Wait a minute.
Tom's up in his bed.
I want you to drink.
How is this even possible?
Where are you using it?
No one noticed me.
I'll wait for you.
Who believes it?
Just talk to Tom.
How are you all going?
We can do it later.

I knew him right away.
Can I talk to you alone?
Life is never easy.
You're hot.

A beautiful girl's in bed.
He's probably not gonna listen.
They went on.
I'll eat a lot of meat.
The color is red.

Surprisingly!
Tom's not a very good car driver.
It'd have been better if you hadn't come today.
His proposal is not very important.
Check it out, please.
It can't be!
He was wrong thinking he had to look at him.
My wife's pregnant.
I'm writing a book.
Stop it, please.
Hoia!
I got to be his friend.
Tom was obviously mistaken.
I'm gonna wash it off.
Am I not beautiful?
You're on the list.

Phh.
It's easier.
We need to keep the meeting going.

Tom wants to see you as soon as possible.
It's not worth it!
Tom's longer than me.
I went to bed once a week.
I still have a lot to learn.

Everybody's gonna be okay.
Their flowers are tomorrow.

I'll give you one good advice.
I'd like to try.

I'm sorry, it's not your decision.
I bought it for my daughter.
Is your mom home?
The investigation is going on.
I like the language of the Provence.
Anything!
Tom's poor in life.
I'd never do that to Tom.

Don't write the word "borch" and "capsassup" in German!
Hey.
It won't be long.
I often learn music from the background.
Who's looking for it?
Don't just stand there!
You and Tom must be happy.
Hey.
I went under the shower before breakfast.
I'm a woman.
They kissed me in the wind.
I'm a Russian.
That's much easier.
We went to London.
I like tea more than coffee.
I have three cameras.
Tom's got two of them.
Haven't I been suffering enough yet?
It's real life.
Eat until she's hot.
I've got to wear them.
As I can see, you were the last one to see Tom.
Here's the address.
Tom was really wrong.
Tom respects your opinion.
We've got what we've been serving.
I slept at ten a.m. yesterday.
We should talk about it.
Are you going to buy a dictionary?
Here's what you're asking.

There are many pictures in this book.
The apparent event may lead to a great outcome.
You gave yourself the best.
I have a friend named Borat in Hungary.
I'm Kana.
How long have you been together?
I just wanted to know if you're in trouble.
Where's the book?
Everyone looks tired.
It's a normal situation here.
I wanted to borrow about three thousand dollars.
Who are you?
He turned around.
Well, it turns out it's not a crime.
Looks like the money's gone.
The book is on the table.
I'll meet him once a week.
Tom's gonna beat me when he knows I told you about it.
Aptsih!

It's my third week.
The gold money institution is much more valuable than it was thought.

We don't need him.
No one can know.
It smells good here.
We know that now.
I'd better call Tommy again.
Do you have a dictionary?
When's Tom coming?
Did you know about the landscape last night?
Is Tom aware of what Mary did?
Things don't always go the way we plan.
What are you doing here?
Please take care of the children.
You can do that?
I'm reading this book.
Where's the hotel?
Do you have fresh vegetables?
Learn to enjoy reading.

What's your name?
Do you live?
The truth is up, Tom.
Did you all go crazy?
Did Tom talk to you about me?
The window is empty.
Have you got your blood?
Baudelaire thinks it's great.
Who wrote those?
I didn't know what to say to him.
Tom tried to protect me.
He's gone to France three times.
How often do buses go?
You're not local.
I'll see you tomorrow.
My name is Roberto.
Is that enough?
What I liked most about the film was the last stage.
I'm a college student.
You should say what you think.
Be quiet.
All the doors of the house are locked.
Tom didn't experience his way into the sun.
Good dreams!
We work day and night we rest.
It's near here.
It's completely logical.
I'll do it without any problems.
There's something wrong with your voice.
They didn't know.
I'm eighteen.
Get your hands off me.
Hello, everyone!
The kids are our little ones.
Tom got up early.
You're a beautiful girl.
Hello!
Do you like to learn?
My name is Hopkins.
Tom told Marie he was arrested.
Is there something new?
The colors are moving.
Not at all!
He likes to read books.
That was when I started to get confused.
What are you gonna give him?
I gotta go now.
Feel at home.
Put the kid to bed.
Ask me anything!
I got two cars.
Please fill out the request.
Where's Tom today?
The dog's nose is very sensitive.
Would you tell Tom I'm over there?
The landscapes are cold.
This house exists.
Thank you so much!
John doesn't know what to do next.
Where's your friend?
I have two brothers.
I better go and talk to Tom.
We can't afford anything.
The boys are going down.
Tom heard of our conversation.
It's my email address.
He's a beautiful woman.
Tom didn't understand why Mary had made such a decision.
It's not the only thing I have to do.
Dead?
Come on, Tom, it's fun!
From year to year.
What's Tom doing lately?
I'm learning English.
Hey, Tom.
Where are the kids?
There's no teeth in the club.
I slowly opened the door.
The kids like the fruit stand.
I'm dealing with Tom myself.
Tom and I were married in May.
What?
The Messians are flying for a little while.
How was the French feeling?
There's no place in the world I could say I'm from there.
Happy birthday, Muriel!
Tom would help us if he could.
My phone number is 9876-5432.
My name is Ricardo.
I'd like to introduce you to my wife.
Is that a lie?
Heather's going to school at 8:00.

Do it somewhere else.
What are we gonna eat tonight?
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
Mr. Johnson's house is next to my house.
Tom was the best son-in-law here.

I'm alive.
Wait a minute.
He talked fast.
Can you send me a screen?
How hungry are you?
This building is being built in town.
He'll get a good doctor.
The boss was trying to catch the rats.
No one wants to fight.
I don't like her face.
Go on.

Now, I'm trapped.
Calm down!
The eggs are red.
Do you speak English?
I want to go home faster.
The paper and wood are falling.
The white box is under the tree.
Better start now.
Tom's running mokasin.
Brazil is the largest country in South America.
Go back to work.
We don't forget.
Tom broke the walls of the north.
It's Sunday.
Of course.
I'm trying to find him for you.
I'll give Tom a message next.
I love chicken.
There's a lot of good aspects to be nice.
Please don't break up.
What do I get out of here?
The car's ready.
He's a good student.
That bag's too hard.
Was there someone else with you?
Tom wants to borrow some money.
Dad's a good person.
Has anyone ever seen me?
Tom's playing.
I'm singing.
I want some pizza.
It's all there.
I understand Turkish.
It is not socially acceptable.
What's going on?
Are you able to ride a horse?
I'd like to go faster.
I wanted to be like a penguin.
I mean.
You both have to go.
The house is cold.
I am so happy that there are so many translations in this sentence already.
Doesn't that sound funny to you?
Rong's going out at 9:00.
That sweater's paying more than fifty dollars.
He's seriously thinking about it.
All right.
I got to start with a totally incredible mistake.
Tom's hands are sharp.
Of course.
How do you and Tom get through?
I didn't have a lot of choice.
What did you think of it?
Did you have to share the bedroom with your sisters?
You're very kind.
I forgot to tell Tom.
I built a new house.
What's your favorite football team?
It's a beautiful dress.
Just follow your heart.
Tom's real.
The ambulance's coming right away.
Listen carefully.
England will require an exchange with the President.
Good morning.
I've got a blue count.
I'm afraid of height.
I want a Swedish book.
Ometi!
Keep trying more.
I'm Irish.
Tom wrote something on the back of the book.
Can I pay with the card?
Tom is afraid that people will tell him what he needs to do.
There are no rails here.
Oh, no!
That sister's big.
Good International Women's Day!
Mari's in the manager's office.
Who made this picture?
Do you live in support?
It sounds like Hollywood movie.

He won the lottery.
Happy birthday!
I'll have some coffee.
I'm home.
I'm eating a cheeseburger.
What are you doing tomorrow?
The Messians are social people.
Where were they?
I'll stay with you.
He bought a walk.
Tell me what I have to do.
Nice to see you.
He didn't understand me.
I wrote him a love letter.
The cab's waiting.
I see you're really very busy.
Don't tell anyone about it.
He's not a long-term growth, but he's strong.
My father is stronger than your father.
Please close the window.
He's crying at the door.
Tom's doing his bed once.
Tom looks like he's dirty.
I have blue eyes.
How did you get your name?
You ran off the engine.
I was a teacher.
My father is stronger than your father.
I'll never find real love.
Tom took his left hand better with Mary.
Jim's gonna open the door.
That camera there is mine.
Put the door down.
Tom's growing land in his mind.
What can I do for you?
Africa is a human resource.
Tom's the one with the car.
Get out!
I'm going to Boston with a ring.
Appi!
They're watching.
What's wrong with you?
I want some ice cream.
Call me.
It's one of the world's biggest birds.
I'm not from Boston.
It's full of leather.
We're in the back.
Tom just talked to Mary.
Hold on!
I've got a big prayer.
Are you ready to go?
That's what happened before.
I'm very shy.
Say hello to your father for me.
"I'm going to class right on time," I thought.
It's not a difficult question.
It's a secret, I can't tell you.
They're coming tonight.
We're all gonna die in the end.
Tom wants you to borrow some money.
The boys are sometimes weird.
His words were far from true.
Tom failed twice.
I live too far.
Tom's gonna be able to help people.
I have two sisters.
Tom's the only one who can speak French.
Tom did his homework on his own.
Do you like this plan?
Tom's awake is dark, he's afraid of height and he's allergic to pills.
Focus on your job.
It took me some time to practice the Venezuelan accent.
Good night to everyone!
It's easy to say.
I'll explain to you sometime.
It's your problem.
Tom, tell me the truth, 'cause I can tell you so.
It's not a long list.
I've been trying to get over my rep, but it's all right.
I've got a tree.
I can't find Tom.
I don't care about you.
I want to be with you.
Oot!
I'll do it next time.
They're leaving.
Good morning, dreamy.
Everyone wants to see you.
Come with me.
Tom doesn't like how Mary laughs.
Not all Brazilians don't like the carnival.
I'd like to be with you.
I'm smarter!
I can't thank you for that.
What time do you have to go to bed?
Tom lied to his mother's signature.
Don't you know what it is?
We're all living together.
"I am" is easy to translate into any language.
He's slowing down.
It's my computer.
Heather's a lovely girl.
Lithuania is a member of the European Union.
I'm Ricardo.

Let me give you some cash.
I have two brothers.
