The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, signed an administrative responsibility for the violation of the time and order of payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for public and municipal needs.
This law is intended to address the very serious problem of non-compliance with its obligations to contractors in the implementation of public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs were unable to receive payment for public and municipal contracts had already been implemented was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia ordered the Attorney-General of the IMF to take the issue into special control.
Since businessmen themselves were unable to deal with misinformed contractors who had concluded contracts not supported, they all tried to break away from their obligations of payment and included illegal conditions in the treaties.
The problem was systemic in general in the country.
Since 2015, 9.7 thousand representations have been made for the protection of the rights of entrepreneurs to pay public procurement and 4.5 thousand officials have been brought to the administrative attention of the investigating authorities for the conduct of the audits of 75 materials and 46 of them have been prosecuted.
As a result, debt to entrepreneurs was reduced to over 66 billion rubles.
These huge amounts were therefore far from being paid for by the non-payment of multibillion contracts.
Many systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs have led to base-based debts.
That's a natural case.
The manager of a small company won a competition for social transport services on several million rubles.
Man has put all his means of business, fully fulfilled his obligations, but he has not received any fixed-term money.
The result is an increasing financial complication of payments, taxes, loans that would have led to bankruptcy if an entrepreneur had not been contacted for the aid of the prosecution.
The problem has now been maximized in several regions.
However, as at the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt on public and municipal contracts identified by the prosecutors of the Russian Federation ' s entities amounted to some 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to meet critical values, the prosecutor is working under manual anti-crisis management.
The Prosecutor-General is personally holding visits with local authorities, which are subject to the understanding of all violations committed by the prosecutors and immediate removal of them.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslav and Ekaterinburg this year.
A qualitative improvement in public procurement will enable the implementation of Federal Act No. 189-FZ "To amend the Russian Federation ' s Code on Administrative Offences with regard to the establishment of administrative responsibility of the contracting authority for the violation of the time and order of payment of goods (work, services) in order to ensure public and municipal needs" signed last week by the President of Russia.
The draft law was drawn up by the Russian Minorities on the initiative of the Genocide.
The new Act will supplement the Russian Federation ' s Code on Administrative Offences of Articles, which provides for the punishment of 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violations of the term and order of payment of goods, works and services at public and municipal procurement.
And if an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for similar offences, he is expected to be disabled for a period of from one year to two years.
All prosecutors of the Russian Federation have already been given an order to ensure the application of these new legislation.
The Civil Rights Protection Group announced a warning of the move to Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of the Advancement of the Colored People issued a warning for people travelling in Missouri because of the State's discriminatory policy and racist attacks.
The Group ' s statement reads: “The prevention of the progress of the national movement by 28 August 2017 calls on African American travellers, guests and citizens of the State of Missouri to be particularly careful and to exercise greater caution on state travel in connection with a number of suspicious incidents on the racist territory, which have recently taken place throughout the state and here.”
According to the National Association for the Promotion of the Advancement of the Colored Population, a recent law adopted in Missouri has made it difficult for people to overcome discrimination-related demands and that State law enforcement authorities often select their minority objects disproportionately.
“You have people who have violated human rights.
They remain on the streets because of the color of the skin, they kill and kill them," said the Kansas City Star, Rod Chapel, President of the National Association for the Advancement of the Color of the People of Missouri.
"We hear complaints often, as never before."
This is the first warning of such an organization's declaration against the State of the United States.
The Group referred to incidents such as the degradation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had finished his state-run gasoline and was arrested by the police of the State of Missouri without being charged with crime.
The warning also mentions the recent report of the Prosecutor-General of the State of Missouri, according to which it is likely to be based on the road for black drivers 75 per cent higher than for whites.
“The goal of warning people to be in the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” Shepel said.
“People must be prepared in such a way or otherwise, whether they will take money for the deposit or inform relatives who travel in the territory of the state.”
According to the latest FBR reporting programme on hate-based crimes, 100 hate crimes were registered in Missouri in 2015 and are committed by a State of sixteen in the State under such violations.
The prevention of movement is also a response to the new law of the State of Missouri, after which it will be more difficult to raise the case against a legal person in relation to housing or labour discrimination.
The former American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties (ACLU) announced warnings for travelers in Texas and Arizona after they adopted new immigration control laws, which required local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which, according to ACLU, had to increase the number of racial checks.
Movement warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but public organizations have recently fled in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people were killed by the police patrol in Egypt
Unknown police patrols in the Egyptian city of Izna reported Reuters referring to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Egypt.
During the shooting, two people, including one police officer, were killed, three people were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two of the men in the armed machine were opened by fire defenders.
One of the criminals was arrested, the other managed to hide.
Rosturism upholds the law on the cancellation of a free warehouse for non-refoulement aircraft
The Head of Rosturisma Oleg Safonov stated in an interview with the RBK Telexal that "positive" concerns the adoption of a law on the abolition of free shipping of baggage by non-refoulement aircraft.
"It is necessary to create conditions in which persons who do not have a warehouse can buy a ticket unless they have a warehouse," he stressed (TAS quote).
In this connection, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the fears of the citizens, it was not necessary to pay for the carriage of upper clothes and mobile phones in hand.
"It would be right to calm down all of our citizens and tourists and to say it, to say that it's up-to-date, to the phone, to the iPod or even to some computer," said the head of Rosturisma.
Former Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the rules on the free carriage of luggage by non-refoulement aircraft.
The point is that airlines can determine the number of locations and cargoes included in the non-recoverable tariff.
Vladimir Putin ordered the removal of Lake Baikal contamination
The President of Russia Vladimir Putin, at the Baykal Protection Meeting, reported that significant areas of the lake had been severely contaminated in recent years.
It ordered the identification of sources of funding, plans and enforcement to eliminate pollution.
Mr. Putin also ordered that the areas of contamination be re-emerged in a thorough manner.
“The clean facilities of most of them must also be dealt with with with objects that continue to work here,” quoted President RIA News.
He also added that the General Prosecutor-General of Russia should conduct an environmental inspection.
According to him, there are problems in the area of the lakes with natural disasters and a number of environmental violations by respiratory agents.
"I would like to emphasize this: not all are capable of checking, but the measure here also needs to be known, but that is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and to take appropriate measures," he stressed.
The former Genocide reported a reduction of fish stocks in Lake Baikal and suggested an increase in the number of facilities under environmental surveillance.
It was recalled that on 15 June Vladimir Putin stated in the course of a direct line that it was necessary to amend legislation in order to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of the special security regime.
The people of the island of Ollong, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory, were informed about the problems of economic activity.
The Head of the Ministry of Nature Sergey Donkey immediately proposed to address the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baykal area, but the Government of Burundi recalled that such a change was insufficient as restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
In the former Miner economy, it was proposed to address the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A New Temple in South Korea
In the village of Sossa, members of the community of the indigenous peoples of North Rhineland, together with the inhabitants of the Berezov region, are taking part in the construction of the Orthodox temple in honor of the Saint Nicholas the Miracle.
Its location is the river shore, and the temple will be well seen from a distance, so it will serve as a road map for fishermen.
According to the representatives of the community, construction work has been completed this year, and now there are churches.
The gamer's Réb fleet has been transporting.
The temple is named after the Holy See, because it is considered to be a holy church as the patron of travelers, including fishermen.
In Société, the fishing industry gives its residents work and feeds them.
Local residents are waiting when the temple opens its doors, and children even write about it in schools as if it were local.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why are Singapore law enforcement?
I'm talking to a local businessman named Chang, sitting in a nice open air.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang uses one cigarette for another, while the chickens carefully store the iron box from the office.
After the end of the speech, a businessman goes to the nearest urn - up to a hundred metres - and then excavates it.
The tax on fraud in the public area - $500 local dollars, reports Chang.
You know, since I was a kid, I've just had a reflex: I can't blow my fangs out of the envelopes on the bridge.
And now it's all over the video camera.
And indeed, Singapore's tractors are in the center of the city clean, i.e. in the museum.
Chang relates: Three months ago, his 18-year-old son, his neighbor, had dug up the wall of an old colonial building.
The court recognized the boy as guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to trial.
What?
Imagine yourself.
He got ten shots of a wooden stick for eggs and spent a week in prison.
We don't have a lot of physical punishment.
As in Singapore, the highest standard of living and incredibly severe laws were recognized by AIF.
No one here thinks to cancel the death penalty, explains counsel Victor Lee Hong.
The Government has long held that both the European Union and the United States have been thinking about this.
If a person carries a large amount of drugs or sells them, he has a fixed amount.
A 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport in 2002: he weighed 400 g of cocaine.
In his protection, the Australian Prime Minister, threatened with sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the pope of Rome, had spoken.
However, the boy in the end was still wearing the same clothes.
Since then, the drug dealers have been trying to turn our country away.
The case is as follows: Singapore states that the laws are obliged to comply with the rules of the Allies, not only the humble and the poor.
It doesn't matter who you are as a millionaire, vice-president, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
One option in this case: If you get a half-cooked cocaine, you'll be raised.
When you go to Singapore and you meet a dog warning table everywhere, you're just wondering how many bans there are in this town!
For example, the nutrient line is sold only in acupuncture and can be bought strictly for prescription (!) by a doctor.
A tourist on his way to the corner will not take it away, but he will have to pull a wire into the metro, which will cost him $1,000.
Four days ago I met two people with white sheets on their hat, "I've got a smile."
In addition to the punishment for broken ovens, it is often referred to as "the reference to the courtyard": a week to pick up parks and beaches.
Six thousand rubs are paid by "the criminal", who has forgotten to smell water in the public toilet, and when he is trying to address a small need in the elevator of the house, a special detector is working to block the door and send a signal to the police.
Exotic laws include bans on drinking lead on the street, public performance of songs and even excessive fields of room vegetation (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts the chambers.
In order to avoid fire from smokers, fires are not allowed in the metre, otherwise they are being shot at 5,000 syngapurous boxes.
In general, the idea is, whatever you're trying to do, you're bound to break something.
This is not the case, trying to convince me of Muhammad Kabir-Kadjariya, the owner of the local tour.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on the bookstores, and in the last two decades I have never seen anyone get involved in their violations.
Why do they stay?
So the people didn't get tired.
In compliance with the basic rules, they are closely followed.
For example, if a minor sells cigarettes in a casino, he will be punished for his theft: the store owner will pay a huge amount, the offender himself will get hit by the back of his pants, and the seller will also be excavated and placed in prison.
This is because of such serious crimes in Singapore very rarely.
Is that right?
In the 1970 ’ s, we were surrounded by chaos on the streets, car drivers ignored lights, traveled as many as they desired, and sat on the street drinking.
After the introduction of the fines for a year, everything was calmed.
Now the driver, drinking a bottle of whiskey, knows that if they stop, the police don't give up on the loan, they're paying fines at the cost of the apartment and for years they're going to be fined.
Many foreigners in South-East Asia appear to be different from the concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the Death Penalty" - a guest from the United States who had a terrible wealth of residents, "the clean airport" and "the cultural nature".
Such things are not natural, they look artificial, and in principle they should not be.
The first day in Singapore, and you're really afraid to throw a book on a tractor, you'll get caught if you get into a metro with a sailor.
But then you come to the "Little India" area, and secondly, "the break of the pattern": the bus stops with plastic sticks.
"And how is it?" you wonder.
And here's what the Singaporeans are laughing at.
Everyone's here.
Not for every kind of crime they commit, but you should know that if they do count you, you will not be rebuffed. You have violated the law.
Most of all, it's enough for a person to get to know himself properly.
Of course, the authorities in Singapore are entirely authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnam I moved very cautiously -- motorcyclists often pick up smartphones and cameras from tourists.
In the center of Paris full of dirty bombs and petitions.
Not all of our streets are trying to throw a monsoon into the oven.
Singapore has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on Earth, thanks to the collection of dragon sanctions and non-violence (the death penalty).
You're thinking.
Such a human nature: remember, and in Russia no one has ever been involved until they have been punished.
Although Singapore is not the main source of punishment, it is voluntary compliance with the laws.
And we have to think that in Russia people would also be happy to have clean streets, lack of a mustache in the subway, and welcome the arrest of those who travel a lift with a public toilet.
These are physical punishments. Thank you.
In the rest of Singapore's law, however, the minimum is to be seen.
Nothing sacred?
Now the White House of Trappa was aimed at the Status of Freedom.
The most reliable sign of change in the regime is when it starts to fight statistics.
The Americans understand this much better than all the others - from here it is intended to be the theatre of Saddam Hussein's status at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key thinkers of the Government of Trapa, no doubt knew what he had done when he had a symbolic attack on the Status of Freedom during a serious dispute with journalist CNN Jim Gimmo Acosto on the president's proposals for a rapid reduction of legal migration.
Being honest, Miller didn't try to be the same.
If he tried to do so, the recipients of the prognosis ship owners and artists of the Statutory of Freedom would have drawn him.
But he tried to understand it, especially the meaning it had been written in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed when the verses of Emma Lazarus were added on the pedestal.
As Miller said to Acosta, "I don't want to go in here deep into history, but the state of freedom is... the symbol of American freedom that threatens peace.
The comfort you are talking about has been added later and is not part of the original State of Freedom."
Miller was right about the facts, but as he himself said, it's actually not about history.
This is about the current sound of Lazarus ’ words of contempt, the only ones in which the State invites not any immigrants but the poorest: "Your natives, your poor,/your crowds who are planning to breathe freely, / the unfortunate disappearances of your indiscriminate borders."
There's never been any "unlucky rash" on our screens.
Miller didn't care about literature -- he explained that these people aren't expected in the United States of America.
This debate on the meaning of the status is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a debate on the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friend who struggled to place her words on the status quo after her death - understood very well that they were doing a perfectly political act.
Sculpture should have been marked by the link between the French and American republics with the banal classic figure of the Women ' s Freedom.
Lazarus changed her mind: The female figure in her speech is no longer abstract, and she has a voice.
And she received a completely different name: Mother of the Evicted.
The combination of stimulants and images was a devastating feminist move and a devastating attack on American motivation.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right to change it again.
Rash Limbo, his son-in-law, John Crist, who brought the Trampa's arrival, argued in 2010, that Freedom is no longer invited, rather than an early non-conservative former American nuclear bomb lying in the dark of the world: "Freedom goes ahead.
It carries the flag of freedom from the United States of America to the rest of the world.
Fakell doesn't need to light up the way to the United States."
In contrast to Limbo's culture, he really fell into the point.
The meaning of the status quo depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would see her successful, unhappy but full hopes on ships ’ decks after a long and often difficult voyage.
This means looking at the world with the eyes of people who are looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
We answer the words of hope and hospitality they hope to hear.
And, of course, it's not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their school should not be lighted up in order to overcome hatred, which is their only source of strength.
2017 World Championship: Nile Black highly appreciates the Scottish members of the United Kingdom Assembly.
Elid Doyle recalls the time when there were only two Scottishs in the United Kingdom.
Neil Blake, director of the Federation's game for easy-to-read athletes in Britain, said that the Scottish part of the World Championship would contribute to "a significant contribution to the team's game".
The record number of Scottish helicopters was selected at the London Championship on Friday 2017.
Blake believes that Scotland is "born special" and that the United Kingdom's Federation should take this into account.
"We know this and we try to understand and support it as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
"I spoke to people at the Scotland Sports Institute, and they think it's about what they did.
The Scottish Federation of Light Athletics thinks they have to work because of what they've done.
The British Federation of Light Athletics: with what they did, they had to work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why things are going so wrong, but it's going to be worse."
Some of the Scottish leagues claim medals, including Laura Moore and Andrew Bacheert, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at 5,000 metres away; and Elid Doyle has chosen his captain.
"Elid is ashamed.
Her capital thing was great," says Blake.
“Many athletes, whether or not they are Scottish or not, and from where they live or train, have left this room feeling proud and eager to win.
And the anguish and the true feeling in which Illiyid was involved were remarkable.
The owner of the silver medal of the Society's fifth World Championship, which runs 400 m away with obstacles, says that 16 Scottish people in the British Parliament are "unbelievably".
The previous record of the number of Scottishs at the World Championship was equal to seven in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Moore, who specializes in the average distance and who lives in the past year, is headed by five British and two European records.
She runs at 1500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Har, who will take part outside 1500 m, is another Scotchman who deserves attention: behind him was a successful season in which there was victory at the British Parliament's election events and annual events.
Doyle recalls his first world championship when, besides her only Scottish teammate, Lee Mackonnell.
The captain of the team says she's "unbelievably proud" because not only her colleagues have come to the meeting but in some cases they will claim medals and fight for the final.
"The capital of the assembly is elected by other members of the team, so it was a great honor in any case, but knowing that your friends voted for you and you, it was a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scottish people who went to the meeting.
This shows how much we got.
And they are all easy-to-do pilots, who are going to go down to the 5th floor of the beginning.
What about my captain's word?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I just noticed that it was very important for us to take care of the World Championship home.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from patients and take advantage of what we're doing again at the Olympic Stadium.
I've got another chance to get into his arena and participate in interviews, and there's just going to be a remarkable atmosphere."
Blocking criticism on Facebook: You don't have to go to public office if you're not ready to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country realized that this was a critical press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't allow them to criticize him for everything from internal politics to his political principles.
The criticism of him, of course, broke out.
But he didn't push his mouth with his criticisms.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "We can take freedom of speech and we, the deaf and the speechless, act as a sheep in battle."
Now I'm going to go to Governor Maryland Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Underway Hogans blocked and shot at at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties brought him to court.
The undersigned governor called this search useless, and comments on the Internet were written in the spirit of "no" and "what".
"It's just Facebook," many say.
But it's important, too.
And it's especially important when it comes to Hogan's guy.
He is an amazing popular republican governor in a democratic state for the benefit of the state.
He is second to the approval of 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not an open reactioner.
He demonstrated a firm hand in the administration of the State and commitment to its principles.
He also uses his flashlight as a primary means of communication with his voters, and with tears, he shows on his page his skin after his head chemotherapy.
It is therefore necessary to block those who come to the governor's page, which is declared an official public forum and which is conducted by tax administration officials, which is not necessary and is ultimately worthwhile.
In the Washington Post interview, Prime Minister Amelia Ches protected the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments is simply their modulation.
But it's too easy to use images of trolleys, umbrellas, and hackers that are wrong on the Internet.
"Post" spoke to some of the real people who blocked Hogan.
And it's real people, not crazy, a teacher, a businessman, a pastor who is referred to as their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectable, containable and not cruel.
The pastor quoted the Bible, citing the fact that Hogan was a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sharma Ramana from Bowi, Maryland, did not express hatred but asked for hate crimes.
"I have written a brief comment that I am disappointed at the absence of his response to the crimes committed on the ground of hatred and other recent news," she wrote in the section of comments to the article in Post.
"I also don't like the idea that when many people leave comments on the same subject, some immediately say that it's so called a short rather than to admit that there is a lot of unsatisfied citizens."
What the sub-governments call "concentrated spam-atak", others would probably call "active living position".
In the era of Facebook, it is easy to edit your image by simply blocking criticism or extenuating negative comments.
This is much less traumatic than it was before when people were required to send, collect and burn newspapers with critical headlines or arrest and hit the mouth with protestors.
But it's the same thing that's happening right now, just in the number.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for refusing to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trampu was asked by Twitter users who were banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first reverse decisions on this topic was taken this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge from Alexandria, James K. Chester, the President of the Board of Observers of the Graph of Laudon violated the First Amendment by blocking the elector in his Facebook account.
In Kentucky, the Republican Governor Mattu Bavino filed claims by the American Union for the protection of civil freedom for his conduct on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the e-mail cost was about the same as today's Internet.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers increased dramatically, and authors of anonymous letters severely undermined its authority.
And even then Washington had business with anonymous trolls.
People under the names "Uricola", "Vallerius", "Beliseris" and "Porcius" wrote letters in the newspapers that ridiculed Washington's decision.
According to these historical documents collected online by the George Washington Document, his office was seized by applications that criticized his position on the Treaty on Friendship, Trade and Maritime.
But he didn't try to keep them silent.
Freedom of speech, inconsistencies and expression is on the basis of our State.
And true leadership means agreement with this.
Ronan Rafferti looks forward to home facilities at the Renessan Club
The former European champion Ronan Rafferti is looking forward to home facilities for the next three days when the Renessan Club in East London will receive twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for senior athletes.
A North Irish skirmish who took the lead next to the Archerfield Links Club and moved towards the final round last year before Paul Ills was lost, joined in the new place and played the role of the tournament representative on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Sarvadi Club.
“I saw how the Renessan Club was built, and we see how it works with it,” said Rafferti.
“The games will see this field at its best moment, it is in great proportion.
Jerry's done a great job trying to save this place.
He's a very dedicated man of this game and proud of his achievements here.
This is a great demonstration for this field.”
English Ills is looking forward to the first opportunity to leave the championship title, despite the fact that he won his 32-year-old career in the European tournament and the European Challenge Tour.
"It's really a special feeling," said a Southport game.
“I couldn’t try to win Extremadura Open again because it was removed from the schedule over the year after I won it.
Returning to this corner of the world is disgusting.
It's a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back, and for me and my wife, Sharon had been especially impressed by winning last year.
It was a very special time, and we will always remember it."
He returned to the war on his homeland, Gary Orr, who joined the European tournament for senior athletes after he had completed 50 this year.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland during the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"When you play home, it's always more important," said the resident of Helensboro Orr.
"You want to say well, but you feel that extra burden."
I played again with great satisfaction, and I showed no bad golf.
I'm happy to see how long I've been getting."
On this field the three will join the former master tournament winner Yen Wesne and the champions of older athletes Paul Brodherst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNalty.
Orr and former Captain Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are two of the six Scottishs on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Steven Macallister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and the parking lot is 5 pounds per hour if one person is in the car and 10 pounds if the person is two and more.
All revenue is coming to the British Foundation for Free Hand.
Britain's roads will learn to smell harmful emissions
The typical tunnels over the mains capable of pumping out carbon dioxide from cars are already being tested on the streets of Great Britain.
The country's transport agency, according to Autocar issue, reported positive results of 100-metre-tonnel tests set at one end of the country in the north.
The tunnel is built 6 metres high from some new polymer materials capable of absorbing harmful substances contained in automobile explosions.
However, the establishment of a global network of such tunnels is only part of the scale of measures that the British authorities are planning to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, English is planning to expand the network of power stations, implement a number of road traffic reduction activities, increase the use of commercial transport on electricity, and modernise heavy cargo parks.
According to official statistics, four of all air pollutions occur in transport, and the air quality is less than 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorsud has changed the punishment of disabled Mamaevu for the punishment
Mosgorsud has changed the punishment of four-and-a-half-year-old Anton Mamayev of his disability to a fine of 200 thousand rubs.
TAS is reporting on this.
The former prosecutor asked the court to replace the sentence by explaining her request that Mamaeva's disease “stops her being found in prison conditions”.
On 28th, Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment in the general regime for the defeat of the former Specialist.
On 19 July, the court released a man from custody at a meeting in SIZO.
Poverty and death in Indonesia ' gold soil '
Ready lunch, Bardina Degei doesn't use the plate.
She's even used to be bad.
In his wooden house in Enoratoli, the capital of Panya district in the southern Indonesian province of Papu, the housewife usually places a sweet cardboard called “nota” right in front of her.
After a half hour, they will be able to eat and eat with their untiring hands.
Dagei is sitting on the ground floor – she has no furniture – and here she is doing her homework, such as a strip of mud water from a nearby well.
The bathroom serves as a safe room without a cross.
She was the younger of her husband’s four wives, so she was not ordered to work in the field.
The majority is scattered here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many are drunk, and there are still soldiers.
“No one decides to go to the village after five nights,” she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look into daily life at the High Papu, former Dutch colony, which was joined in Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in favour of the occupying forces.
The existing movement of independence from the Netherlands quickly provoked its anger on the Government of Jakarta, which maintained strict control over the region without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, while the independent Papua New Guinea State occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enorotali is a city as far as it is concerned; the road here includes a half-hour flight from Jaapura, the administrative center of the province, Nabir, and then a five-hour drive to the cheapest car.
There's no public transport here.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses covered with bamboo fences, and the roofs from the roof have been decorated with sand in various roses.
I'm not talking about journalists, and I'm not talking about any of the foreigners anymore.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the pope had paid me for my service to God by the name of Uga Tame.
There were other changes.
“It was unusual for him to wear this dress,” says Degey, pointing to his bright, hand-cuffed prison, dark suit and bright dress.
"We used to wear only sheets of paper."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population live in extreme poverty, while children's mortality and literacy among the poor in Asia.
But it's still Indonesia's gold soil.
The largest gold mine in the world and the most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran in Phoenix, is located in 60 miles from Panya, the highest province of about 153,000 people in New Jersey.
In 2015 alone, Freeport received some $3.1 billion in gold and silver.
The Addendum to Papua New Guinea may be commended for the forest stocks valued at $78 billion.
These wealth, however, lead to one calamity for the populace, guaranteeing that the strong armed forces of Indonesia are still here with their life-sustaining presence.
According to a New York Times survey in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, the Freeport company paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million, including up to $150,000 per officer.
The demand for greater autonomy by the popes threatens the existence of this gold home and is unfortunately undermining it.
According to human rights defenders, since 1969 more than 500,000 popes have been killed by the Indonesian military forces and thousands more have been raped, tortured and deprived of liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in the indigenous peoples of the Popu Highlands in the 1970s can be considered a genocide.
Only last year did the Indonesian police arrest more than 3900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We are losing everything,” the report published in 2016 by the United Kingdom of Great Britain bears witness to acts of violence committed in the past year, such as fines without trial, torture, particularly as confirmed in another report, rape and electric assault, and the violent wave of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because events take place every week,” says Andreas Harson, a study conducted in Indonesia by Human Rights Watch.
The Hague has been overwhelmed by the resources of Papua New Guinea to attract the flow of immigrants from other areas of Indonesia.
The population of the province is 83 per cent Christian, but demographic indicators are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Slovakia.
Javan lavenders, "warungs", sell hot chicken and mixture of the fruit "year-old", which is served with an achiisic sauce.
Local people are trying to maintain competition.
“Migrants started selling cigarettes and fruit juices on a traditional market than the natives of Papua,” explains Abbet Yo, a 20-year-old Panya student who moved to Jaapura, the administrative center of the province, because of work.
“That is why the indigenous people of Papu – Mama (women) of Papu – have lost their market of income.”
Indonesia's President, Joe Vidodo, known as the people as Jokovi, has committed inequality and violations of rights in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Court in Jakarta, the former commander pledged support to 27 of the 29 Papu districts, including Panya.
But there was hardly a change in Papua, and the local people felt betrayed.
“Our heart is broken because in 2014 we voted for Jack, hoping he will fulfill our hope of restoring justice,” says Yoo.
In fact, two months after the October invasion of Jack Panya, the tragedy was over.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street and washed births in the coast of Enoratoli, when two Indonesian soldiers flew out of the darkness on the motorcycle.
The frightened children told them that they should include the falsifiers.
As local pastor Javette Tebhai reported, one of the soldiers tried to find them and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the drunk soldiers were followed by children and were examples of witches.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One boy, sixteen-year-old Julianus Emo, was so badly killed that he fell into it.
A couple of hours later, a government building of the electoral commission was lifted, and the next day the situation worsened.
About a thousand populace men, women and children were gathered in the football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual baths and performed the baths, a dance of the populace tribe of meo: they ran around and painted birds' drink.
Some protestors began throwing stones at the police and the military base.
When the situation got worse, soldiers on the inside radio were ordered: “If the crowd is three times against them, shoot them,” he said, as stated in an official document seen by the correspondents of the TIME magazine but not published in local media.
Fifty - year - old Jeremias Cajame, head of the Kego region, who lives in Enarotoly, felt near danger and called for peace when he approached the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to hear it.
"When I got back, my left leg suddenly burst into dust," he told Time magazine, standing on the edge of his bright wooden house.
We still don't know who shot him, but he says the bullet flew from the Shiring army.
"There was a crowd, there were lots of shots," he adds.
A local resident of Alfius Jova was shot three times, as reported by his twin brother, who became a Witness of the shooting.
"I fled to him and looked at his body to make sure that it was him," said Johns magazine in a dark tone, which, like many Indonesians, is only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I buried him."
General Yotge Mende, the senior police inspector of Papua New Guinea, told the reporters that his officers had only “protected” their base because it had been attacked.
"We must protect when people threaten to kill us," said the representative of the police of Papua New Guinea in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more injured.
The news of the murders reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jack was born in Jaapura, where he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and asked about the history of abuses by the authorities in Papua.
“I want this situation to be eased immediately, so that it will never happen again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, the Minister for Security said that he would establish an unwarranted organization to end historical violations of human rights.
But he's almost there for answers.
“Most of the violations have occurred long ago.
Some of them had a place in the nineties or at the beginning of the zeros.
The fact is, of course, we want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be taken.”
Viranto then rejected his statement by speaking to the magazine TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said that he was not planning to establish an organization to deal with the complaints in Papua.
Rather, he said, "All will be judged by the courts."
Viranto, who was charged by the United Nations with “crimes against humanity” for the death of more than 1,000 people during a blood vote on East Timor in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been brought to an end, including an incident in Spain.
The families of the victims from Panya met such statements with a dark mistrust.
“For the past three years I have been interrogated four times, but no changes have been made,” says Johannes.
"I'm smart."
He says years later he's still alive in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the soldiers will arrest me, I'm afraid they will shoot me."
His brother James also expressed the view that the people of Spain are afraid of discussing the event.
He said he was shot by soldiers after he helped to bury four victims.
"After we had buried our bodies, the soldiers came after me," he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot wooden residents near Panya District of Deay.
During a meeting between the wooden residents and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help take the man who was unconscious, to the hospital, to the death of one person and 17 others, including children.
A man, 20-year-old Ravianus Douv, who was caught by fish in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The offended villagers protested at the construction site office owned by the company.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at officers who responded to the warning shots.
However, locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian expertise) has been shot at and killed one person.
“We were in such panic, we were afraid of compensation,” reported the TIME magazine of Twenty-nine-year-old Doming Badie, who lives in the hospital and saw the early delivery of the wounded.
"I've been home for two days."
Parliament of Deay needed the officers involved to call for an answer and the mobile police brigade was withdrawn from the region.
The country has always been a painful place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of significant development is due to a lack of tribal borders, mines, data and dams scattered throughout the territory of the central highland areas of Papua.
Many have joined the "Free Papaw Movement" (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of the papayas by eliminating sporadic attacks and kidnappings on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the senior OPM leaders are from Panyai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Cgoya.
As a responsible measure in the past few years, thousands of people in Spain have been arrested and unjustly detained by the military under the proposal “Protection of National Independence”.
Some of them didn't come back.
Among the people of Papua Pania is considered to be “a place of grave, forgotten”.
Poverty is fueling a lack of satisfaction.
The small share of rice sold in Enoratoli is too expensive for locals.
The bread is not available at exactly the same level.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly notes and some fruits and leaves.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of which can be covered by four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the seed for the family, while the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten club notes are totaling 10,000 Indonesian mines (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between indigenous peoples and new migrants have increased, which have reached large numbers since the introduction of new airports at the airport of Nabir.
A number of existing vacancies are usually available to more educated and state-of-the-art migrants.
Papuas often have money or skills necessary to carry out their own competitive business.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village... because there’s no work here, no money,” says John Gobay, president of the Panya National Council.
The isolation holds Papu from the views of the rest of the world.
At the same time, restrictions on the work of international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudie and Basil Lonshan had been deported from Papua for “inadequacies with the relevant organizations” despite having been granted limited videos.
According to Felima China, Deputy Director of the Human Rights Watch of Asia, the promises made during the Jockwie pre-election campaign to remove restrictions on the work of the media in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“The foreign journalists trying to report from the Middle East Indonesian provinces, Papua and Western Papua are now facing new dangers: visa refusal and blacklisting,” he said.
The lack of attention by the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is mainly limited by direct neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands — called on the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “various and widespread violations” in Papua, including the bombing in Panya.
The same countries in the past supported OPM.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Aramant Nasir, withdrew from a group that reported to journalists in Jakarta that “in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there is a free press, so it would be difficult to conceal testimony of human rights violations”.
Local residents want more foreign Governments to focus on the situation.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Dutch human rights envoy, Kaiss van Baram, visited Jaipur on 4 May, the local people violated the silence, asking: “We want freedom”, as the source who also attended the meeting said, but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia there will be new presidential elections in 2019, but the popes say that they will probably vote for Jack again.
"Jocky is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting in Panya," says Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokvy to know that the people of Panya, besides living in the shadow of the threat by the Al-Qaida army, are in poverty, and their education and health are in a state of misery.
Goba says that the people of Panya, like other popes, consider their vote to be for Jack, the debt that it should pay.
He says, "They do not need any money. They want justice."
Despite threats and threats, the families of the victims of the shooting in Panya have carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they have buried the body of one of the victims on the ground directly against the police and the military.
Knowing that justice is probably never wrong, at least they will not allow the innocent to forget their crimes.
"The murder of a member of our family," says Jacobus, a non-head.
"What else did we do?"
The second time, fire covers the Dubian skyrocket "Fakel"
The fire covered one of the world's top skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, prompting hundreds of people to leave the building quickly at seven hundred and ninety-nine feet [337 m].
It's already the second fire on the high wall, called "Fakell" for two years.
The building had been evacuated, there were no reports of human victims, and there was no operational news about the cause of fire.
“We burned and disappeared from the fire signalling and screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and we needed about ten minutes to get down from the fifteenth stage, ” reported the Reater, a weather agency named George.
According to the Civil Defence Department of Dubai, fire forces fired fire at approximately 4:00 a.m. on local time (00 a.m. on Ginwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide shelter for the victims.
The event could bring back to the agenda the security of materials used in the world ' s outlying buildings.
In the investigation by the Fakela administration after fire there in 2015, it was found that most of the complaints were made by external panels used for formulation and isolation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said that it was believed that the insulation system and the placards of the Grenfell-Tauir building in London could speed up the spread of what occurred there in June, resulting in about 80 deaths.
The growth of the tourist stream in Ida-Viruma was minimal in June
According to data received by the port correspondent rus.err.ee in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017 the services of North-East hotel companies were used in a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, up to 125 per cent or 0.6 per cent more than in the same year.
The number of local tourists has declined, while the number of foreigners has grown.
Thus, the foreign flu increased by 7.3 per cent (544 people) in June to 7994 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The number of Russian tourists in the region increased significantly by 8.9% or 318 compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, 3885 RF guests stayed at the Ida-Viruma hotels.
Andrey Malahov gave it to the worshipers who are guilty of his care
Andrey Malahov lured his worshippers into Instagram, which blames him for the "First" channel.
So far he has never commented on the audience, but today he has translated the section of the newspaper Knowledge for August 1.
Photo by Mallahov signed the "boss molocos".
The article on how to prevent "incineration" of the employee and to pay attention to his situation.
If you remember a number of reports that the leader was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived publisher who was about to transform "Pull" it becomes clear that he had so clearly pointed out that he wrote "KP".
As reported, the television broadcaster Andrey Malahov is currently on leave and has not signed a declaration of withdrawal from the First Channel.
The situation can be explained in the near future.
Five soldiers were killed in Afghanistan when the car was exploded
At least five soldiers were killed when they were shot in the Afghan province of Gilmend.
According to the police, an abandoned car had been hit by night with a military blockade on the way to Girishk.
It's about 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new press conference was held in Gyrishka.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
A switch between attackers and security forces continues.
The guy took a video from his camera.
The director and researcher Greg Skomal (Greg Skomal) wrote a video about the battery that tried his GoPro camera.
Rolic presented the U.S. Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, a member of Somalia, on Facebook.
The incident occurred on 2 August on the coast of Cape-Cod in the north-eastern United States, explains Portal Necn.
The man was trying to remove the battery from the camera that was holding on the special deck.
The man noticed that the animal had moved more than six feet [3 m] in length.
Acula agreed to cut the camera and did not try to attack a scientist.
Mostly, he explained that the witch came in such a way to determine whether a bastard was injured.
The researcher added that sharks could easily destroy crops.
He also noted that such behavior of marine animals had occurred to scientists in the news.
A well known cause of mass destruction in the Ural War Center
At the Ellan Training Centre, where a mass shock occurred, a working group of senior military officers from the Central Military District arrived to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some of the details of this strike have already been known.
According to the Mash Republic, the contractors of the U.S. military unit number 31612 were severely beaten because of an uncontrolled flow of blood, as shown on the VContact page.
It all started with the fact that a row named Sayan had demonstrated disregard for an officer's order to make an excuse.
The officer's staff from the sixth floor were set up.
Sajana kept her first leg.
In the mid - 1940 ’ s, 140 young boys were thrown into a concentration camp of blood and cancer, slaughtered glass.
More than ten people were injured in mass traffic.
The CVO has examined the information on shame.
The study showed that at least one fifth of U.S. passengers were carrying prohibited items in the aircraft.
The study showed that more than 20 per cent of passengers were on board the aircraft knowingly or casually through the U.S. Transport Safety Department inspection posts prohibited items, including at least 6 per cent were seated on the plane, despite having their registered knives or other sharp items.
Nearly 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally had firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charterers, Inc. and more than 1,000 people also showed that young passengers are more prone to break the rules.
Of the respondents who recognized that they had deliberately tried to escape from anything that was prohibited by ATA, 19.7 per cent were millions compared to less than 15 per cent of the X-generation.
In addition to the ABB staff, food and water are often supplied.
More than 3 per cent had been recognized as having been specifically subjected to severe examinations and 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men had recognized that they had been deliberately engaged in illicit drugs.
The company stated that it had studied passengers throughout the country to find out how many of them had been vaccinated through airport inspections and how many had done so.
We are fully expected that more often, knowingly or in ignorance, they oppose the contraband by checking out those who fly more.
As the company points out, the ABB rules are quite complex and interesting.
People often do not know exactly what speeds they can carry and how much they can carry.
So it's no wonder that most of what ABB picks are prohibited fluids.
Some time ago people thought that ABB might consider the book to be banned.
Jewelry is permitted on domestic voyages, but not on international routes.
Chapter EPA Puritt rejects the intention of deferring the implementation of both emission reduction regulations
The following day, after the request of 15 states, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency withdrew its decision to postpone the implementation of the regulations adopted by Obama to reduce emissions of pollutants from air and energy-generating substances.
Pruitt explained its decision that its agency is now more than in previous administrations, subject to the needs of environmental regulators of individual states.
He did not mention an appeal against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute has spread around the period of 1 October to which states are required to comply with the 2015 ozone standards at the ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that it would defer their compliance for one year to give its audience more time to study the plan and to avoid “inconsistencies in local decisions or obstacles to economic growth”.
Priitt, who had previously been appointed President Trump on his current post as Prosecutor-General of the state of Oklahoma, was known as a consistent violation of environmental standards.
After the move to Washington, Puritt, he repeatedly blocked or abolished the introduction of standards that opposed the chemical or oil industry.
The unexpected change in the middle is a regular legal breach of the Pitto course to return to previous standards.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the head of EPA had exceeded its authority by attempting to postpone the implementation of Obama ' s rule that requires oil and gas companies to track down and reduce the flow of metals.
In a statement issued in the middle of the evening, Pruitt suggested that, as soon as the Ozone Standard Course had changed, he had simply fulfilled EPA's obligation to cooperate with States in the integrated process of timely implementation of new standards.
“In previous EPA administrations, it was often not possible to enter into the deadlines, after which it was expected to request from activists and others and discuss the deadlines during the settlement of the case,” said Pruitt, who placed more than one against EPA at its previous post.
"We do not believe in regulation through judicial processes, and we are seriously concerned about the deadlines.
We are deeply concerned about our constitution and the power that it gives us."
However, the EPA statement states that Privitt may at some point re-use its "authority for delays and other data by law" to ensure that the rules "jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information" are clear.
The Republicans of the Congress are focusing on a broader review of ozone rules.
The draft legislation approved by the House of Representatives last month seeks to defer implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this matter.
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that week of appeal against EPA, said that the group was planning to continue legal pressure.
"The change in the EPA course - following our demands - is an important victory in the fight against health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the power of their city," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delever, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as Colombia.
Earth-level ozone occurs when conventional pollutants from cars, power stations, power plants and other sources enter the atmosphere in response to sunlight.
The resulting power can cause serious problems with breathing in people who are sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Health defenders and environmental defenders welcomed the unexpected change in the Privita course.
"To think seriously about how much pressure it took to achieve this is a perfectly logical step from the human being to protect the air we drink," said Lori Ann Bard of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the administration of Trapa and protect those who pollute the air and their particular interests."
The IAAF Congress extended the removal of the Russian Federation of Light Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the removal of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics (WFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAAF Board for the recovery of the FFA, which issued a report on Monday, recommending that the removal be postponed.
For the extension of the removal, 166 people voted against - 21, transmitted TASS.
The report of the Board of IAAF stated that FFLA had made significant progress in meeting the conditions established by the Board for the restoration of membership, but these conditions had not yet been fully met.
As a result of the disqualification of VFLA at the World Championship in London, Russian helicopters were forced to speak under a neutral flag.
There were 19 members of the IAAF Premier.
WFLA was permanently disqualified by IAAF in 2015.
The report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Dumping Agency (WADA) was then published, which dealt with numerous violations of the WADA regulation by Russian officials and athletes.
For more details on the last report of the IAAF Council, see the material "E" "IAAF extended sanctions for VFLA".
Double-declining
Under the 3rd round of the Russian Premier PFL, the newcomoscian "Hymik" has launched a campaign against the "Caluga" FC.
More than 10 days ago, opponents played each other in the Russian cube, but this time the painting of the game was different.
"Chemic" didn't make any point, but the secondary weakness at the end of the match led to the second wave and fiasco.
After a recent defeat by a calujan with a 0:3 count, many earlier prophesied a light victory for farmers.
However, since the beginning of the New York Times, they have been considered and acted on the defence but with a strong stance.
In the 1st grade, they were more able to build and have the advantage of owning a sword.
Alexei Sirotin was a very good fighter, who several times suffered serious injuries and gave the partners confidence in his actions.
Unfortunately, there was no effort and effort in the Himek attack to put the Caluge defense in the top and kill the first bullet on its way out.
After the game was over, it was time for the meeting courses to be held.
New Yorkers were more active in the attack.
Our team's anxious calls have been made in defence, which has allowed the colleges to create a number of tough moments.
Within 10 minutes before the end of the Himik meeting, he took over the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the Colousan’s experience played its role — they were more grammatical and cold - blooded at the end, giving their moment to take the door.
After a dangerous attack by Himik, he transferred the sword to the corner of which the farm had been moved to the door without opposition.
The author became Yuri Dubrovin.
At the report's "Himik" showcased a harmless game, but he suffered a serious defeat.
Our team is waiting for another departure - 11 August at 19 hours in Moscow at the "Torpedo" stadium, the name of Eduardo Strelzkov's novelist, to meet with the favorite group "Centre" FC "Ararat", consisting of Roman Pavlučenko, Marat Ismailov, Igor Lebedenko, Aleksey Rebco.
Come and support Himik!
The location and time of the New Yorkers meeting - 1830 hours outside Magnolia (East, D.2, Corp.
Chemical composition: Sirotin, Mankhin (k), Romatánko, Shayunov, Homotto, Gogia (Oreškin), Dudati, Rizov, Saints, Belanin (Adoevces), Andreychenko (Ligine)

According to the published telephone communications, Trap had forced Mexico to pay for the wall at the border
The Washington Post newspaper published the signing of telephone talks between US President Donald Tramp and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a telephone conversation with President Enrique Neeto Tramp, Mexico, he tried to stop it from publicly stating that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The President of the United States cursed him for speaking against the wall in public and, according to the above-mentioned information, said to him: “You can’t say this press.”
Trap started his pre-election campaign by promising to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and promised that Mexico would pay for the project.
In his first telephone conversation with Prime Minister Malcolm Ternbull of Australia, he also found a hotbed.
Tromp told Ternbull that the agreement that the United States had to accept refugees sent to Australia was “a joke”, “a joke” and “a trap”, and he insisted that, because of the agreement concluded by Obama, he would look like an idiot, just as he had intended to stop the movement of refugees in the United States.
Trump concluded his conversation by saying to Ternbull that "it was the most unpleasant conversation for the whole day".
Dead bodies in Abkhazia sent by a plane from Sochi to Petersburg
A plane owned by the Russian airline, on which the bodies of the dead in Abkhazia of the Russians, at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, transmits TASS.
At the end of the investigation, the ship will meet the officials of the ritual agency, as well as the representatives of the city Mary, told journalists by Deputy Minister for Curators and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamir Ahba.
Former IMIS representatives stated that all the costs associated with delivery back to Russia had been incurred by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Suhum intends to pay compensation to families who have lost compensation in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Ahba, Abkhazia's leadership was prepared to pay the families who had lost their lives as a result of the eruptions of tourists and their residence in the Republic, but the relatives had only made the Republic more dependent on the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On 2 August, about 16:20 at the time of Moscow, two explosions occurred in the village of the Premier Guadelouth region, consisting of the missile-artillery weapons of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic, followed by the detonation of large caliber shells and other ammunition.
As a result, there was a fire in the warehouse that caused uncontrolled explosions of various modification equipment.
As a result, two Russian citizens - Elena Polakova were killed in 1970 and Elena Timofeva in 1962, who were at rest near the source of birth.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 Abkhazia, were treated with various injuries to the medical institutions of the Republic.
There are currently seven persons at the station, the remaining ones.
A study of Russia's influence on the American elections took a big turn
Russia's Special Prosecutor Robert Muller gathered a large party in Washington to study Russia's influence on the US presidential election in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to call witnesses under oath.
The materials collected will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to bring charges.
The gathering of a large jury gave Muller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of the investigations of the jury, which began several weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son then another candidate in President Donald Trampa with Russian lawyer Natalie Veselnik.
Check the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, had previously promised Mueller himself.
They're already researched by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that young Donald Trap had expanded the state of his lawyers.
The young tramp earlier told him that he had been waiting for a compromise at the head of the candidate from the Dhamparty Hillary Clinton, but no dissuasive documents had been submitted, and that was the end of the process of adoption.
At the beginning of August, a number of media reported that the statement of the young Trappa on the meeting with Veselnik was literally addressed by the older Trappom.
In the White House it was explained that the president did not dictate anything but simply used his authority to do what any father would do.
Vice-Marie Penzi was kept at work.
The Deputy Head of Administration, Penzi Irina Shirchina, has been detained for 48 hours after the post of the Follow-up Committee at its place of work, reports RIA News.
Official communications from the law enforcement authorities on this matter have not yet been made, but the SUC Press Service has assured them that they will soon follow.
There's no comment on what's going on in Mary's Penz.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five Deputy Heads of the Department of Pensions.
It addressed urban issues and land relations since April 2015.
She has been working for a long time by the Head of the Gosjilstrühtechinspektion of the Pensions Area.
Irina Shirshina is raising three minor children, and it is noteworthy that she has been a mother several times a year ago, and she has given up her leave and returned to work.
Of course, there's no space in Mexico, no rocket carriers.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the establishment of the Yuria Gagarina bridge is a day of respect for the first human being in space.
Unlike memories of the Soviet period, which are held in some countries, the Gagarins, on the other hand, are “on the planet”.
In 2012, the monument was established in Houston, U.S.A., at the former NASA headquarters.
In London a monument was established in the realm of the Royal Observatory during the 50th year of the first flight to space.
There is a remembrance of Gagarin in Germany in Erfut, where our cosmonaut arrived in 1963.
The memorial at Karlov Varah (Czech Republic) escaped contact in 1992 with public protests and was transferred from the city centre to the area before the local airport.
In the 1970s, Gagarina, in Riga, became a monument to Yurius Gagarins.
This is how the name and family of the first Latvian cosmonaut sounds, and it looks like it's been completed for 70 years.
Mors Ford murder: Activists lose Lina's courts on stage to appeal to justice
Ford Merciuri went beyond the sights in the city of Monroe in Georgia in 1948 and was excited to enter the little Mors Ford Bridge.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver was on its way to the bridge, a group of white men with wheels made their way.
The main man, a middle-aged man in a thin bed, was covered with a cigarette and looked through the windscreen.
The insides were scared.
"We need this nigga, Roger!" said the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
The prosthetics broke the silence when a young black man jumped out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a scenario.
But when Roger was on the show, almost all the viewers and the truth were hiding the spirit.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Mors Ford Bridge to play again that night when two black men, Roger and Doroti Malcolm and George and May Murray Dorsey were lined up in 1946.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's obvious that no one has been arrested these years - although we see them together; although we know who they are," said Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the order.
"It's five in our history and it's a stone in our souls."
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of George's Congress, which has been fighting for human rights for the rest of its life.
To him, a spectacle is a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder of the people of Monroe that injustice has not been corrected.
"We want to investigate, we want to finish, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he says.
"We can't go to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
The Coroner covers a simple body of one of the victims of Maors Ford's licence on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBR material received by En-Bi-Si Newez, more than 50 people in Monro and neighbouring graphs were suspected of participating in the licensing.
But no one was charged with this.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, human rights defenders say that the city has always been well aware of two related reasons: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court’s decision first allowed black citizens to vote on the threshold they had to meet that year.
At the same time, according to the FBI, blackmailer Roger Malcolm hit Barnett Hester, a white farmer, apparently because of women, at the same time.
Brooks says that, according to the city, Hester slept with his wife Malcolm Doroti, and that the child she was supposed to be born was not of a husband.
According to the FBI, on 25 July 1946, Loi Harrison, a large white owner, paid $600 for the release of Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they left the prison and walked to the Mors Ford Bridge, a mob of licensee surrounded the car.
"It is clear that he organized and commanded Harrison's murders," says one of the FBI reports.
"It is also evident that there was a conversation between state and city law enforcement authorities who not only participated in the killings but also destroyed the streets and hid the identity of witnesses."
Brooks calls this step.
"It was an attempt on electoral rights," he says.
They have all been killed in order to send a signal to the city: "If you are registered and vote in favour of yours, it will be the same."
For nearly ten years, Cassandra Green has been leading an annual show that re-producing this ring at the Mors Ford Bridge.
Its performance is watched, it captures the viewer and tells of the deep racism that many would like to see no more in America.
It's hard to see and it's even harder to turn back, but Green thinks it's the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about the Linca courts because they show us our own birth," she says.
"But I can't build relationships with you if you don't listen to me or hear what I've been through."
This year's performances began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 white actors, the rest of the blacks, gathered in rooms and listened to a tape review for years.
Wade Marbo was the director with Green.
He has played the role of the lead member of the clan for years, but he says that the role has not been easy.
"I think I've fallen because it's not the person I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at that time."
In the role played by the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, play.
The show starts with Malcolm, disappointed that Hester's sleeping with his wife Dorota, screams and interprets him.
"I said, well, get out of my house!"
Calling Rascona in response.
There's a hit.
At the same time, all (at least all black actors) are exposed to chaos.
Green laughs at everyone.
"What's the matter" asks Ascona.
He's worried and confused.
Am I playing?
"No," says Green's joke.
"I just don't think the whites then said "nigga."
"Yes," said one of the black executives.
"You must confess the hard r."
The energy in the room is also changed: the discount is changed by the feeling of friendship.
Everything should be done right, not just for the play, but for the memory of the four people who were killed.
The scene is starting.
This time, when Rascona says the word "n", it gets clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The show ends with a violent and fast end.
Crying, shooting, and then quiet.
A woman in a tragic black suit is standing on the bodies of actors and playing a heavy song by Billy Hollywood "Strange Fruit".
Her voice stops by word.
In the hundreds of holes from it, half-eyed viewers draw out the eyes of the floor and the floor.
There are almost equal numbers of black and white among viewers.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the presentation; many live together.
They've been suffering for almost eight hours from George's heavy spirit while Brooks took them to the Malkolmov and Dorsey tombs.
To date, the murder has remained only history, but now that they stand at the same place where people were lined up, their views seem to be echoed right here in the air.
When the last note of the song comes to rest, Green invites people to come closer and look at the body.
Children hang on their heads, they point to the red, representing blood, and the invisible bodies, and they bite something else.
"They're not dead at this moment," said one little boy, to remind himself of it.
In a few minutes, Green will thank the viewers, and the second is over.
Actors pull the strings out of their shells and pull the strings out.
Bradshaw's wearing Marbo, a man in his suit who played the main doll.
Nick Rascona has two other actors and another, crying, falling in their arms: the emotional burden of the performance has finally come to an end.
"It's all right," one of the women's hats.
"We know that your heart is good.
You have reason for this."
Later, viewers will sit together with actors.
At one table a white couple from Atlanta were excitedly discussing a black couple with whom they had just met.
Denise Dapplinski has a hard time writing words to describe how she feels after the show.
"It's hard to hear these terrible, sad words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think the licenses are still going on," she adds, "only now it's called the police shooting."
In the second corner of the room, Tyron Brooks ruled as a general reference to his work as a human rights defender.
He said that it had already begun to plan the next year's presentation.
"The stay encourages us because it not only describes the fear that we have survived but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't get out of this lesson, it can happen again.
He who does not learn his story, and who does not know his story, is doomed to repeat it."
The judge sentenced Naval to a violation of the "Aggitation Sub-Constituent"
Aleksey Naval killed 300 thousand rubles in violation of the mythical order.
The opposition was recognized as guilty of an administrative offence provided for in paragraph 8 of paragraph 20.2 of COP RF “Recovery of the organization of the myth. ”
The former judge of the Moscov Court of Moscow, Hzir Mussakaev, concluded an administrative case with Leonida Volkova, head of the opposition headquarters of Aleksey Naval, who was responsible for the same article as the Naval.
Volkov was convicted and sentenced to 300 thousand rubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakaev assessed the distribution of letters to "aggitation sub-item", which were held in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
Having seen the agit materials that were followed by the subcontractors, the police thought that the organizers of the event had intended to hide its true substance as a public action (which required prior authorization from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zdanov and Alexander Pomazuev requested that administrative proceedings be terminated because of the absence of a crime and indicated that the police had allowed certain errors in the preparation of the protocol.
At the very "aggitating sub-sub" Volkova was not detained, but he received an agenda that required him to appear in the police office to discuss the activities carried out during his active participation.
The same agendas were received by the Naval and another opposition counterpart, Nicolai Laskin.
In Mordovia, a young girl shot and three guests were arrested.
The Court of Mordonia arrested a local resident who had been shot at a wedding of four persons, including a bride.
This was reported in the Department of Public Administration of the Follow-up Committee.

As a result of the injury, three women and one man were injured.
The criminal case was initiated under article 213, paragraph 1 (a), ( "Hulganity"), article 30, paragraph (a), (e), (e), (i) and (ii) of article 105, article 105 ( "The attempted murder of two and more persons in a general way").
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened a fire because the guests of the wedding decided to buy it and went through his place of water.

The EU Press Service stated on 4 August that anti-virus sanctions had been extended due to the scandal surrounding the supply of Simens turbines in Crimea.
The Arguments of the Week have been reported earlier.
The EU Council Press Service stated that the sanctions against the RF were extended because of the scandal with the Simens production turbines, which seemed to have been handed over to Crimea under sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries to increase anti-corruption sanctions.
It was previously reported that the final decision would be taken by the end of the present day and that the sanctions against Russia had been extended.
Pierson reduces 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to return to business
On Friday, the British Educational Group of Pirson announced that it would reduce 3,000 more jobs and reduce the amount of temporary dividends by 72 per cent due to the start of a regular restructuring programme aimed at combating the problems facing their businesses.
These cuts in jobs, which, according to the head of John Fellon, will mainly occur at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, are in addition to 4,000 jobs reduced during the previous restructuring.
Pierson announced that it was planned to reduce expenditure to another 300 million dollars ($394 million) in May during the third cost reduction programme in order to try to return to business, which has affected the rapid transition to digital learning methods.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its share in the Penguin Random House to its partner, the Bertelsman concert, said its forecast for the year remained unchanged after it announced an increase of 1 per cent in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
An attack on a convoy in Kabul: soldier Nato died as a result of an explosion of the dead
According to information received from official sources, the terrorist death victim attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killed one NATO soldier and wounded several others.
Five soldiers and translators were injured, as reported in the NATO report.
According to unverified data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the city area of Karabakh.
This explosion was the last of Afghanistan's bloodbaths this month: on Tuesday it killed more than 30 people.
On Monday, a terrorist killer killed two people at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, an explosion that occurred on Thursday night occurred when a joint war with the Afghan army was attacked with the help of “one man with a self-distributed explosive device”.
All wounded are reportedly stable and are treated at the U.S. military hospital at the Bagram airport.
Correspondents report that the growing power of Taliban and group known as the Islamic State (IG) in Karabash is a major source of concern to NATO forces located near the Bahamas.
According to the United Nations, in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 there were at least 1662 victims among the civilian population and around 20 per cent of them were in the capital.
At the end of July, the terrorist death toll on the car resulted in at least 30 deaths in the Shia region in Kabul.
The Taliban said they had caused the attack.
On 31 May, as a result of a powerful explosion in the city centre, more than 150 people died, the most serious number of human victims in the country since the U.S. military took away Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence focuses on an emergency situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump assesses whether there is a need to increase the number of United States military forces providing assistance to the military and police in the country.
According to the correspondents, the tactics in Kabul over the past few weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its line of conduct, and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Gani.
The Environmental Protection Agency cancels its decision to defer the adoption of the Air Pollution Act
The U.S. Environment Agency has refused to defer the adoption of the Obama era law by which states should limit air pollution emissions through the day after 15 states have handed down to the agency for that purpose.
In the middle of the evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “zone measurement 2015”, stressing that this step showed the Agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and respond to them,” said Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce ozone dimensions where existing air pollution is measured in various parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet more strict air pollution standards by one year until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, along with the Federal District of Colombia, filed a claim that this intention was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trampa seeks to reverse a wide range of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barak Obama under a broader programme aimed at the deteriorating economic growth of the Trampa.
But action in this area has led to opposition from democracies and environmental organizations which are concerned about the potential impact of major emissions on the health of the population.
The Environment Agency's website says that the use of ozone-containing air “can weaken the function of light and enhance respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.
The European Business Association spoke against new anti-corruption sanctions
The European Business Association has expressed disagreement with the United States economic sanctions against the IMF.
According to the EBA, such measures could lead to a significant reduction in production and number of jobs.
AEB's statement states that business is an important link between countries and people, so free trade principles cannot be restricted.
The European business combines more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the Heads of State and Government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would enable businesses to separate from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution to the spirit of peace and agreement.

Putin required research bodies not to use hard disks
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, proposed that the investigation bodies should not exclude servers and hard disks from working computers on businesses.
The Head of State made a statement at the meeting on investment programmes in the Middle East.
According to the President, it is necessary to “remove the use in the investigation of measures leading to the cessation of business activities, including the removal of hard disks from working computers and servers”.
Putin noted that if the investigators had such a need, "it would be sufficient to remove copies, verify them and use them during the investigation".
The Head of State added that it was not possible to " create conditions that prevent the continued activity of an undertaking from taxing until it was impossible to pay taxes".

Mike Garcia and Vasili Lomachenko meet for the first time to discuss the possibility of a solution
Vasili Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who, in general, are constantly moving to conduct the most exciting boxing match of up to 147 pounds in the near future, first met on Thursday.
They held separate rooms in the ESPN's office rooms in Los Angeles while Garcia, an unconquered champion in the light of the World Boxer Council, did not pass the corridor to welcome Lomazenko, the World Boxer Organization campaign in the second half of the month.
After the unique victory of Garcia over the former World Championship in four heavyweight categories, Erieen Bronner on the showtime channel, both boxers are among the five best boxers outside the weight category.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
You're lucky."
Lomačenko protects its nest in one with Miguel Marriago on Saturday at seven o'clock on the ESPN channel.
When the boxers looked at the photo, manager Lomachenko Egis Climate noted that the potential decisive fight between them would be the first.
"I used to be in the middle of the night," Garcia recalled.
"I've been in the category of Bronner's radar [up to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big anymore.
I'm drawing for 140.
I want to go down to the pool.
And he needs to get up to half an inch [by 135 pounds], and then we're going to get a unit.
That's what patients want.
Let us make it up to them."
Lomakenko agreed.
"The box needs this unit."
The climate asked whether the fight should be transferred through the PPV service, as part of the strategy he maintains that Lomačenko undertakes his debate in approximately 135 this year in order to appoint for the next year a meeting with Garcia (37-0.30 knots), which is also interested in meeting with the winner of the unity between Horhe Linares and Luke Campbell after their battle for the World Cup on 23 September.
“The fight may be on PPV because all the patients have asked for it,” said Garcia, after expressing his willingness to face the channel that will offer better financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other names will cause such interest.
As soon as they are ready,
Garcia said that he considered Lomačenko to be “a boxing boxer” and may have visited his sub-item.
But Lomachenko didn't start to thank Garcia immediately and said that he thought that the three-way champion from Riverside would look like "be slow, sorry, Mikey... you asked for a drink."
Garcia said she was focusing on showing the power of the attack, and then the box.
They both said that they felt the pressure increased in front of their own unit.
“This fight must take place.
No other fight is of such interest and speech.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I was waiting for someone from the ballboxes, and here he is, Mikey.
That will be a great struggle."

New test results for assessing the age of asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest results of asylum-seekers ' tests in Sweden, which have submitted a new health assessment method of age, show that more than 80 per cent of respondents have been evaluated as persons under the age of 18 but not all believe in the accuracy of these findings.
The Swedish National Judicial Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicalverket) initiated tests earlier this year.
They were designed to assess the age in the asylum process more accurately after the Swedish Migrationsverket criticised that it could not determine the current age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
At the present time, Migrationsverkt conducted 6,880 trials, and the court medical agency has now published 2,481 trials for the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty-eight per cent of those tested were assessed as persons 18 years of age or older, and in 25 other cases, the judiciary assessed that the “probably 18-year-old person or older” tested.
In the case of 432 cases, it was stated that “probably less than 18”.
Tests are carried out only when the age of man raises doubts.
According to John Göranson of the Judicial Medicines Agency, the results are consistent with the results of the past month.
“We do not see a big difference between statistics in the past month, the number is fully relevant,” he said to The Local portal.
The high proportion of cases where people have been assessed as older than 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the agency published 581 test results and reported that in 442 cases “faster than the age of 18 years or more”.
However, having considered 581 published results, Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, 18 people had openly stated that it was being implemented this year.
The method of medical evaluation of age, which is used to make the teeth of wisdom and tomography of bone compositions and to provide them with analysis of dentists and X-rays, has also been critical in some institutions.
One of the sceptics is an endocrinologist from the Carolinian Institute of Claude Marcus, part of whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people to determine whether they have passed through sexual intercourse before or after the habit.
“I have had reasons to think about it, and I do not think that it is necessary to use the measurement methods that are now being used.
The biological age is therefore very uncertain.
If we can't define it with confidence, we don't have to do what we can," said the Metro newspaper.
However, Göranssen, from the judiciary, said in the light of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of taking a child for an adult child is wrong.
We face the greatest risk when a person is about 18 per cent in this case.”
I'm wondering if you're going to vote for the president.
During the work trip to Buryatj Vladimir Putin said he was ready to think about whether he would vote on Russia's presidential election in 2018, he gave an "Interfax".
This statement was a response to the request of the residents of the village of Chemushka Burit.
During the video conference on the elimination of fire in Burundi and the Irkutsk area, the meeting called on Putin to say: "Vladimir Vladimirovic, we ask you: when the next presidential elections are held, we ask all of you to relocate to this post."
"Well, I think, thank you," said the president in reply.
On 28 July, Russia's press secretary, Dmitri Peskov, commented on some of the media that the presidential headquarters of Vladimir Putin would lead the administration of RF President Anton Vino.
Peskov called these assumptions “no underlying hypothetical arguments”.
"There's still no chairs, before they're built away, before the election campaign away," Peskov said.
"It's not on the agenda yet," Peskov said.
The Governor of West Virginia said he was moving into the other party
Governor of West Virginia, the representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justin, announced on Thursday during a meeting with President Trampa's participation, which was transferred to the other party.
"You like it or not, but democracy has gone away from me," said Governor Justin.
"Today I am speaking to you in many prayers and in many thoughts... today I am telling you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be useful to you as a leader of democracy."
Mitting's been exposed to aerodynamics.
"That's why I'll change my registration to the Republican tomorrow," added Justin.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time to play another."
Previously, Trump had promised that an important statement would be made at a meeting in West Virginia.
Tramp won 42 per cent in West Virginia, and Justin did not support the candidate from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton.
Justin, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he belongs to coal mines in five countries, as he inherited coal business from his father.
It is estimated at $1.59 billion.
At that time, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement on Thursday evening that “The passage of Governor Justin into the other party is another attack on the Democratic Party, which is moving faster than it is working to make our country big again”.
“In the light of all 15 governors and control over the minimum number of state legislative bodies in history, the statement by Governor Justin is just another refusal from the party that has no leadership over the bottom and is unable to find a positive, combined message,” reported CBS News, representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party of Ronna McDeniel.

Who praised Russia ' s “exactly” apology for the doping scandal
International Light Athletic Specialist Sebastian Kou praised on Thursday that he called for sincere apology from Russia for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it is now an inappropriate time for the country to be allowed to participate again in sports events.
The representative of the Russian Federation of Light Athletics Dmitry Schlechtin reported at the International Association of Light Athletics, which had been hosted by the World Championship on Light Athletics, that his country's removal from sports events was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized “to all athletes who had stolen gold and silver medals at the fairs. ”
Despite its comments, the Congress of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations voted in favour of the continuation of the removal imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Dumping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence of the use of doping by the State.
“I have been shown that today’s response, today’s report has been very honest,” said the rapporteurs, President of the International Association of Leagues of Light-Athletics Cou.
“The whole Council and the Congress have been pleased... that the Russian Federation itself recognizes that it has been through a very hot time and is now doing everything possible to take care of the re-establishment of the Federation.”
He said that he was also “harmed” and that Russia agreed with the criteria for its restoration.
“I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Special Commission, which now does not have time to restore Russia to its rights,” Kou said.
“For the next few months, we have to do everything we can to handle this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean sportsmen from the entertainment system.”
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting the strict criteria of the International Association of Light Athletics, will participate under the neutral flag in the World's Light Athletic Championship, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the Special Commission of the International Association of Lightweight Federations Rune Andersen stated on Monday that a number of requirements would still need to be met for Russia ' s recovery.
As he reported to reporters in London after a report made to the International Association of Lightweight Federations, drug testing is not yet carried out on a sufficient scale, and foreign trainers are still doing their work in peace.
The Court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of being a gossimist
The U.S. Department of Security (SBU) of Ukraine (SBU), journalist Vasili Muravisky, who was arrested for two months, handed over to SBU.
The Internet staff member of the Jitimoira Journal is suspected of a state-of-the-art change by placing his publications on Russian websites and in violation of Ukraine ' s territorial integrity.
At the same time, Russia does not support the actions of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it “warwar policy” against the media.
Two years after the outbreak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship Commander Borsini entered Libya ' s territorial waters to then, along with the WMS, stop the flow of illegal migrants.
The decision to initiate the operation was adopted by the Italian Parliament in the middle.
Rome has agreed with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which does not control most of the country ' s territory.
The opposition cabinet and the Libyan Parliament based in Tobruk accused Italy of violating the sovereignty of Libya.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarshal Haftar, issued his sub-command against Italian ships.
In Rome, however, it was stated that they did not believe these threats and that another military ship was intended to sail into the Lebanese territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks of Italian Prime Minister Paolo Jentiloni and the head of the recognized European Libyan office of Fayaz Saradja.
The Italian authorities went to the establishment of a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after a census was published in July of the number of illegal persons from Libya: 95 thousand people from the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that the resources for the adoption of migrants were exhausted.
A scale event occurred in Skype.
The global commitment to the Skype service has now been established in several countries of the world.
On Thursday, 3 August, users began to file complaints to programme developers.
In Microsoft, experts have already worked actively to address the problems faced by the people of Europe and North America.
We remember that in June of this year, Skype was also involved.
Users have been unable to receive and send messages for some time.
Two leaders of Ukraine's collection of easy athletes were removed from the CM
Olga Earth and Olse Povch, who specialize in short-range escapes, are excluded from Ukraine's collection at the 2017 World Championship in London.
This is reported on the Federation’s website for the Light Athletics of the country (FLAU).
Such a decision was taken by an efficient organization in connection with the establishment of the International Association of Light-Athletic Federations (IAAF) disciplines for Light-Athletics.
A trainer from the Ukrainian delegation was also excluded from the ground of Sergei Basenko.
As Sportsrena reports, IAAF suspects sportsmen using doping.
Povh is a bronze exhibition of the Olympics 2012 and the 2011 World Championship, the 2010 European Championship in the 4 to 100 metres stage, the Earth is the winner of the 2012 European Union in the 4 to 400 metres stage.
The World Championship for Light Athletics in London will be held from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial rules of football affect the move of Niamara to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited losses by European football clubs do not interfere with the world record of the transfer of Niamara from Spain from Barcelona to Paris, France.
Any consequences could be further achieved by the "Pari San Germany" on the side of the UEFA, a leading body controlling the European football, in which the authorities are authorized to ban the participation of troops in the prestigious League of Championships tournament.
The Financial Fair Plays Regulations introduced by the EAFRD in 2011 should finally show that the transferred nemara was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid €222 million ($262 million) only to free a Brazilian from the contract, and Nemar will receive a complaint that will reach $10 million a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of the move to France by Niamara.
The PSP can be precisely released to take Nemara and add it to the galaxies of other stars if the funding of the team is taken into account by the rich energy of the family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums on the acquisition of games, but they need to balance them with the legitimate sources of income in order to achieve the profitability of their football business.
The FFP introduced Michel Platina after his election as President of the UEFA in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that were heavily indebted to their efforts to succeed were, in fact, jealous and threatened to break up if banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP ceased focusing on the debt of clubs and instead turned to track their losses.
As a result of this change in business model, which Roman Abramovic used in Chelsea in 2003, to buy clubs with good potential and then to make a serious effort to improve the team and create a world brand, it became a difficult plan.
During this three-year period of assessment covering 2018, clubs may lose EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that the Platinians had withdrawn from the presidential post in 2015, his successor to WEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still firmly committed to holding excessive costs.
"Of course, "FFP" is alive, and we will, moving forward, strengthen the rules," said the Assoyed Press Agency last week, Andrea Traverso, who controlled FFP at WEFA.
Although the PSC pays the rent of the Nimara contract at the same time, it can distribute this amount at the full time of its contract for account.
Nemar signed a five-year contract so that the transfer value can be shown in the annual accounts as a cost of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, severe sanctions were imposed on Abu Daby Manchester City, who belonged to Abu Daby.
“PSP” has been imposed a fine of 60 million euros (after the course is 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and has been prescribed to limit its team's composition in "Lig champions" during the period 2014-1015 by 21 games instead of normal 25.
The WEFA monitors clubs that may try to speed up its financial inspections by disbursing their income from companies related to the owners of the club.
Although Qatar ' s company could provide “PSP” but if the amount of funding was considered to be above standard market estimates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered legitimate income.
That is what happened in 2014, when the EAFRD decided that the amount of the PSP funding by the Office for Tourism in Qatar was disbursed.
It was reported that part of the Niamara wage in the IPCC could be paid by the Organizational Committee of the 2022 World Championship in Qatar.
But PSPs and Qatar-2022 refuse to be a messenger of the campaign of peace, and such a manoeuvre could easily be discovered by WEFA inspectors.
The previous sanctions imposed on the JIU meant that the EAFRD would be more careful to follow any attempts to break the rules.
As reported in the fourth case, the UEFA did not hold a preliminary discussion with the NEPAD on the transfer of Nemara.
They met with the Assoyed Press agency under anonymity, since they were not authorized to discuss the status of the PSC.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, the GSP received more than 10 million euros in sales of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
It is expected that the arrival of Nemara will be a welcome ground for sponsorship transactions, the sale of attributes and football with the team's logo.
The club is expected to increase at least 30 per cent by borrowing a new game.
No doubt disappointed that one of the best footballers was involved, the Spanish League tried to break the Niger transfer, claiming that the PSP would violate the financial “fireplay”.
“This is an obvious case of financial doping, with the club and the State,” said Spanish newspaper AS President La Lighi Haveir Tebas, meaning that the final owner of the PSG is Qatar.
Arsenala Trainer Arsen Wenger, who owns an American sports magnet, shares La League's doubts about the State's funding.
“That is all the consequences of long-term participation, and this has completely changed the football landscape in the last fifteen years,” said the Fourth Hungarian.
“When a club belongs to a country, maybe everything.
It will be very difficult to comply with financial fairs because the country may have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious game.
The President shall determine the order and place of the oath
Where and as new Russian citizens will swear to the loyalty of the IMF, the President will determine such amendments as to the second reading of the relevant law has been prepared by the Gosdoma Committee on Legislation and Construction.
More than a week ago, MPs planned to determine directly how to make an oath in law.
Children up to 18 years of age will be released from the adoption of the obstetrical oath, as well as those unable to do so, from the revised text of the draft law entitled "Citizenship of the RF", which the Committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on 11 July.
On 6 June, President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of introducing an oath in the presence of the RF instead of a formal signature of documents.
Members expressed this idea as an amendment to the second reading of the draft legislation on the abolition of citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist crimes: for example, for public calls for terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (see 2 p. 205.2. of the RF), as well as for the flag of aircraft, travel or water transport, but only if it relates to terrorism (p. 4 p. 211 of the RF).
According to the bill, its logic was as follows: by documenting citizenship, a person is under a promise to comply with Russian legislation - he is on the way to extremism, and he violates that promise.
The draft law was introduced in April by the head of the thought groups Vladimir Vasiliev ( "Agenda Russia"), Gennadi Zuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Girinowski (LDP), Sergei Mironov ( "Just Russia") and GD Večeslav Volodin.
On 19 May, the MPs adopted it in their first reading.
Last week, the GD Committee on Construction and Legislation approved the text of the draft law on second reading, but it was now recast.
He now says that the procedure for making an oath will be set up by the President of the RF.
The former parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the Act "On Civilization of the RF", which indicated that the ceremony should be conducted in a state-owned condition before the State Herb and the Russian flag in the presence of a representative of the MDG.
However, it was not clear from the text of the draft law where such an event should take place - a list of places where possible the presence of the RFG is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of government of entities, municipal education, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executives, etc.
Most likely, it could be ZAGS.
To make a solemn oath to obtain the nationality of the RFs will be after the officials check their documents.
However, the Russian passport will only be obtained after making an oath, followed by the written text.
A week ago, the draft referred to the fact that an oath must be signed.
The updated text states that Russia will be 18 years old, not 14 years old.
A rule has been observed which exempts persons who are incapacitated or who are unable to make, read or sign an oath in their own right.
In addition, the President of the IMF has the right to exempt from this procedure and other persons,
The updated bill also provides for a special procedure for the adoption of Russian citizens of Ukraine, who are considered Russian-speaking.
They shall be officially dismissed from Ukrainian citizenship by providing a declaration to the competent authority of Ukraine for this purpose.
A written copy of the statement will need to be transmitted to the Russian authorities.
Refusal of " foreign" citizenship, as it is now, will not be required if it is provided by an international treaty or if it is not possible "on the basis of reasons not dependent on the person".
The relevant amendment to the law was proposed by a group of MPs, including the first vice-president of GD Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalya Polonskaya, Paul Kraschennik and Ayrat Farrakov (the "One Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a ticket from Ukraine isn't really, it's just impossible.
Accordingly, very many people were waiting for their decision on the nationality of the RFHR, which explained the frustration of the head of the Mental Committee on Construction and the legislation of Paul Kraschennik (ER).
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on the employment of certain foreign posts would not be extended to those who had given up “other” citizenship in writing and had given prior passports to the Russian Federation, but had not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country for “no reason”.
Foreigners are now prohibited from taking office at the municipal service, being admitted to work on facilities and in an organization that is involved in the security of Russia.
Also, a person with a dual nationality or type of residence in another country cannot become a member of the Gosdoma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force from 1 September 2017 and that the necessary acts should be prepared.
Nostalgia becomes a low in the Fire of America and Detectives.
The present rise in history reminds us of the glorious days of the 80s; the period of the border in the 90s (e.g. when Masters David Wayne and Michael Sowalter made a comedy of the "State" for MTV); and it is about himself in 2001, before its stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Pauler and Paul Radd turned to more serious things.
As a cultural fact, it is at the same time raising and expanding our era with its constant memories from Facebook.
But as French it is called anachronism.
"The first day of the camp" was a good surprise, not only because of the absurdity (including the original story of the fruit-talking bank, which was heard by H. John Benjamin).
The result is double the main score: middle-age actors play sexually concerned children who have only reached their full age; this makes it impossible to return to being part of the score.
"Ten years ago," where adults were already adults, they had less deep emotional roots and their family was more unsympathetic and included raps from steel films of the 90s "Handy" type.
In one episode, there are Apple Powerbooks, four-wheeled roller caps and "the other thing from 1991".
Many of these are the same.
The well-being of the Kup (Shoolter), now the writer, has not yet had any contact with Katie (Margerit Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet been out of his virginity.
And there's still a stupid, low-end speech that Ronald Regan (also Shoolter), now supported by George Bush, the elder (tested model in the performance of Michael Jan Blayk).
As always, the best part of French is the separation from it.
It's particularly fun to see a young Radda who sings Matt Dillon's song from "One" character, whose ex-boyfriend Andy now looks old-fashioned.
The success of this French could be a case inconsistencies in the spirit of the seven-up recursive series until it comes to its logical conclusion: "The warm American summer: twenty years ago", where all companies would go to the film's top film "The hot American summer" last stage.
The "Invasive Detective" of the Amazon is referred to as another type of nasalgia: memories of the Cold War from the Americans, the Explosive Blonds, or even the "Blessa" with its images of the war of the East and the West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alejandro Tanako with director Riss Thomas, is a television screen: a Romanian police drama in the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for the truth, atheism and the Marxist-Lenin road.
The main roles - seen life by Gregor and Joseph's idealist - are performed by Florin Piersik-young and Cornelius Ulich, and their dialogues with English Chenning Tatum (the same executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levett.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are several visual shots (police take time to look at the chess match as Americans can watch the football).
The command of the famous votes for the quorum - among them Jenny Sleet, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevini - makes it interesting to play "Ugada vote".
But it's like the "Courage Detective" is supposed to look like an undisclosed propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in Ronald Regan's mask, which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are covered, and they are not very, very often.
If he were to do it in a favor, the Good Detective could better deal with his sitter in the spirit of the agitpropa; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come into the American embassy, two pregnant men sitting in the living room with a hamburger dog.
The image, given by the imagined Communists, says that Western culture is capable of making a living.
The Romanian authors of the film are no longer wrong: We are doing so with our own recent history, and so are they.
The Russian Supercube football team between Spartacus and Lokomotiv will have a total of 30 million rubs.
In this regard, the President of the Russian Football Prime Minister (RFPL) Sergei Pradkin reported to the press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70 per cent of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that at the moment tickets to the match are almost gone.
"Spartacus"- "Locmotive" will be on Friday, 14 July, at 21:30.
As TASS notes, Spartacus is an active RF campaign and Lokomotiv is the owner of Cuba.
Two young vampires cleaned the furniture cells for 200,000 rubles
A 37-year-old Ufimer with a furniture company was contacted by the police every day.
The man said that he was very expensive tools from the steel, which had caused serious damage to his production.
The winning gear has become a total of nearly 200 thousand rubles: two contrast devices, perforator, hydraulics, glued.
The guards started looking for criminals and soon went to the residents of the Blagwestan region of Baskorotostan, 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press service of the Republic of Moldova, the media broke into the territory of the enterprise, broke the door and brought out the tools.
Shortly thereafter, the guys sold the stolen technology to the first down-down car service.
They had already been aroused by the robbery, and law enforcement had been able to return only part of the stolen instruments to the legal owner.
Mr. Medvedeva commented on the relationship between the IMF and the United States
The United States and Russia must be able to work together.
This statement was made by the official representative of Ms. Hizer Nauart in response to the statement by Prime Minister RF Dmitria Medvedev on the relations of two States.
The former head of the Russian Government stated that, with the adoption of new anti-corruption sanctions, the United States had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and announced a fully-fledged trade war for the RF.
In commenting on those words, Nawart acknowledged that Russian-American relations were "low", but noted that it was necessary to seek "interference powers".
"Look at the peace on the southwestern part of Syria, which has been observed for nearly a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," says RIA News diplomat.
At the same time, the representative of the Foreign Office refused to comment on the statement by the Russian Prime Minister that sanctions were equivalent to a trade war.
The draft legislation on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the CDR has been signed by US President Donald Tramp.
He recognized that the document had failed and was contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior "increased" roses from amethists and quarks
The French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - completed the Rose Dior Bagalle and Bois de Rose collections.
There were five new wheels and three wheel-cockers on the barbed wires.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan is released two new keys and a column of amethists, rose-crackers and brilliant men who are performed in the art of gliptics (hand cut by stone) and respectable and devoted to the 70-year-old home.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Viktuar de Castellan was inspired by roses that grew in its place in Granville by Christian Dior model, and by the Parisian gardens of Richatel and Pre-Catelan.
Trap found guilty of a breach of relations with Russia
U.S. President Donald Tramp made a brief criticism of the members of the convention.
According to the U.S. leader, their actions had led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at a low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, these people can't even give us medicine," wrote the president on Twitter.
The arrest of Donald Trapp has signed a new law on sanctions against Russia, Iran and the KNDR.
They will, in particular, affect Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House later issued a statement by the President in which he indicated that the law would not allow the United States to conclude profitable transactions and even closer to the IMF, China and North Korea.
The Belorussian entrepreneur refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
Victor Prokopenja, a businessman from Belarus, appealed from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) for the purchase of Sberbank's subsidiary.
A businessman explained his decision to the UK to "focus on other planned investments and projects we work on".
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a step would be "the most timely investment", despite the investment attractiveness of Sberbank's daughter's purchase.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main bidder for the purchase of the Russian Bank unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the NorvikBank Consortium of Georgia Guselnikov and the Belarusian company South Gucerieva in July.
The Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after the President of the country, Peter Poroschenko, imposed sanctions on their subsidiary structures in March.
One of these financial organizations, in addition to the WTB and the Foreign Bank, became Sberbank.
Money called the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
In the Ministry of Energy, the IMF called the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the Chamber, Alexander Novak, made comments on what had happened.
According to him, the islands remained without electricity due to the road transport incident in the territory of Krassandar.
As a result of the failure of Cuban and related Crimean Networks, the TTPs of the transmission line have been decommissioned.
The power supply of large Crimean cities was fixed last week.
Specialists have removed the gaps within a few hours.
It was first reported that the cause of the blueout could be anomaly.
The Bank of England maintains interest rates at 0.25 per cent
It is expected that the Bank of England will be later announced that the percentage rates will not change after the low economic growth and declining inflation have caused hearings of potential increases.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain non-tariff and left interest rates without changes in the pressure on family income.
The Bank ' s monetary and credit policies (MPC) have been voted against by 6 against 2 for the maintenance of levels at the level of 0.25 per cent, and a smaller number of members of the Committee have been said to increase this month because of the lack of support for growth.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank limited its projections to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that the pressure on family income would continue, while it was still expected that inflation would rise to about 3 per cent.
However, the Bank had warned that increased rates in the next few years would be needed to control the inflation generated by the deficit, and stated that borrowing costs would likely be higher than expected in financial markets.
The members of the Committee also voted in favour of withdrawing from the civil package of economic development measures launched last year after the crisis.
From the following February, the Bank has closed its emergency financing plan for which it provides banks with cash credits, although it has announced that it is now expected to provide another 15 billion dollars, up to 115 billion dollars.
In the Bank’s decision-making Protocol on Rates, it stated: “The growth of gross domestic product (GDP) is likely to remain slow in the near future, while the pressure on real income of families continues to affect consumption”.
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that, in order to stop inflation, “some financial policy increases” would be needed to “increase the size of the markets.”
At this point, the market is expected to grow first in the third quarter of the following year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be “progressed” and “limited”.
The Bank's projections for increase in this and the following year are lower than the projections made in May, which were equal to 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank left its unchangeable forecast to 1.8 per cent in 2018.
Following these news, Sterling fell in relation to the dollar and the euro.
The money fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was taken after recent adverse growth rates had been reduced by an increase in expected growth; GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter against 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth, the judge in general, remains at the level of 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although there is still a slight increase at the end of the year.
The bank's last report on inflation provided little reason for the happiness of households affected by high inflation and a significant increase in wages: according to the bank, pressure will push ahead of reducing.
The Bank added that financial policy “cannot prevent” earnings in the next few years, but expects that payments will be reimbursed “very” by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also focused on growth as a result of a growing demand for British goods due to the low rate of cash that compensates for some of the underutilized consumption costs.
The decision was taken over a year after the rate was reduced to 0.25 per cent in August following the shocking results of the EU's drop-out referendum.
The Bank's estimates are almost four years old in order to have a full impact on prices and economies.
Before the Bank had made its last decision on rates, it had increased its noise around the proposed increase in rates, as inflation had increased its pressure on households and so on: three members of the Committee of Experts had asked for higher rates up to 0.5 per cent in July.
In the past month inflation fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that the decrease was expected and was reimbursed in the coming months.
According to the bank, a higher rate than planned 2 per cent is the result of a low rate of cash.
Andrew Montleyk, director of the Korean mortgage brokers company, said: “If you take into account the recent drop in rates of fraud, the judge in all, the mortgage market will become even more competitive, as creditors demand business opportunities and count on the good end of the year.
The market seems particularly favourable to those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, such as credit refinancing, often with the absence of the Commission, and with a low rate, become as popular as ever.”
The Public Health Service will describe the conflict of HIV-related preparations of 10,000 people
From September onwards, patients will have access to the “revolutionary” HIV prevention preparation after the battle in the High Court on the financing of the preparation from the Public Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that the HIV prevention (PREP) preexposure tablet, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in the risk group by an average of 86 per cent, will now provide health care for about 10,000 people during the initial three-year trial period.
She agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal had upheld the Supreme Court ' s decision last year, which claimed that the National Health Service had an opportunity to pay the PreEPR despite her statement that it should be funded by local authorities.
This step announced on Thursday was called “the major innovation” by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Board (NAT) called it “the turning point”.
Prior to the full launch of the programme throughout England by April 2018, Venezuelans in London, Briton, Manchester, Liverpool and the Sheffield will first start registering, and more dispersors will join the programme in October.
Predepositive prevention (PREP) is a course of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
As studies have shown, the PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
With the adoption of the PreEP before sex in the human body, there is sufficient number of certain preparations to prevent HIV infection.
Such preparations may be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients with the right to the preparation include homosexual and bisexual men, transgenders and people whose partners are HIV-positive and who do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensers shall select appropriate participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and persons whose partners are not aware of their HIV status in antiretroviral therapy.
People living and enrolled in general practice in England will also be able to apply for a potential participation in the nearest Venezuelan dispanzer participating in the programme.
The programme will amount to 10 million pounds, and this week the National Health Service of England signed a procurement contract.
The study is designed to assess all the possibilities of the PREP for collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the preparation, its identity and its application to a large extent.
“This is an important innovation that needs to be complemented and strengthened by greater and more successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is one more than three decades of success in combating one of the greatest health threats facing mankind.
Debra Gold, President NAT (National AIDS Control Board), said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
The PRSP, if it is intended to be widely targeted by people in need and at risk, will allow for a change in the status of HIV epidemics in England.
From September onwards, people at risk of HIV through this study conducted in England through the National Health Service will have access to a new open new means that man can control himself without discussing this with a partner that will lead to the improvement of many lives.
We welcome this news."
Jan Green, President of the Terrens Higgins Foundation, said: “Now, first of all, there is a need to ensure that the test is rapidly spread across the country and that no one in the HIV risk group is forgotten.
Now, when we are provided with an experimental preEP, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people in the HIV risk zone.”
The Minister of People's Health Sharon Hodgeson said: "We very welcome the start of the PreEP trial, which has been very late for months of delay and failure by the Government."
The data show how revolutionary this can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the elimination of this annual infection.
This test will draw us closer to the full understanding of the advantages of the PreEP.
It is now important that the test be launched as soon as possible across the country to protect those at risk of HIV and to continue to move us towards a halt to the spread of HIV into society.
The World Conference of the Fathers adopted a resolution on support for the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The sixth meeting of the World Congress of Tatar (WCT) adopted a resolution stressing the importance of maintaining the position of President in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is “a positive recommended form of organization of the highest public authority in the Republic and of the national interests of all Tatar people”.
The meeting also stressed the importance of the Treaty on the Limitation of Powers between Russia and Tatarstan in its resolution.
According to the document, he “has played a positive role in the development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole in the ethnic, socio-economic and social and political development”.
The agreement between Moscow and Kazanya has been concluded for 10 years since 24 July 2007.
On 11 July, Mr. Tatarstan's MPs called on the President of Russia to extend the agreement and to retain the title of the head of the region.
Tatarstan is now the only federal entity with a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only post known as "the President".
In Russia there were difficulties in obtaining international driving rights
The GIBDD substations test the lack of international driving licences (IMU).
In order to obtain such rights, it must be expected that within a few weeks this problem has become a problem for vacationers who want to go to the outside of their car or take a call for it.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving licences remains contradictory.
The IMIS was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, as the information in it was explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are set out in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Movements, but in the countries which ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized as such.
However, it is still dependent on specific police or prosecutorial offices: some require VAT and someone has sufficient national rights.
In order to ensure that international rights are maintained, it should be taken into account that in non-ratified conventions (e.g., United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) authorities have the authority not to recognize national rights or VAT.
There is now a problem with whites in almost all GIBDD units, reports the Commersant, carrying out a number of studies in several regions.
Yes, in Moscow the UGIBDDs are simply not issued, and the whites are not available for four months.
It can be written on the website of the guest, but it has now spread to mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk it is impossible to obtain "for technical reasons" without detail, and in the Samar area, it is fair to say that there are no whites, the same situation exists in other cities.
The problem has already been faced by many Muscovians, the following reports have been reported more and more frequently in the series:
Irina Burmistrova: "Remember why international rights cannot be obtained in Moscow?"
That's right, because all GIBDD offices have been closed.
Elena Podcolzina says, "Question for people who know!"
International rights need to be obtained very quickly.
In Moscow it's always gone a long way ahead. Talons don't go out at all. (button is, but talent cannot be given).
The kind of portal of a guest shows that the Spbs are free to go to the fair.
Did anyone try to get in another town?
She's working?
As explained in the MDG, the requirements for international driving licences were changed, so new forms were provided in the Gosavton Inspection Unit.
This may be related to a deficit, which, of course, is unclear, which changes have not been reported earlier.
The Bank purchases the Centre for Road Traffic Safety (CSDBD) and then transfers it to the GIBD Unit.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with OO Goznak: nearly 200 thousand WUU forms have been made in 2014-2015, 15 thousand have been purchased in 2016, between 2017 and 90,000, but the latest contract has been concluded with OOO "First Print Room" for production of 70 thousand.
There is a version that the CSN has simply failed to conduct a tending, which is why there is a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of whites: because of the crisis, many people have become self-equipped not in Europe, but in more southern Asian countries, China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are taken there until the end is unclear, so people are threatened and there is an urgent demand for international "steps".
It has recently been known that professional leaders should be subjected to an examination to confirm their qualifications.
Such a proposal was made by Mr. Mintras.
The international driving licence (ITU) of the new model is valid as of 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimea bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine Paul Petrenko stated that he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
On Friday, 4 August, he said in an interview at the Portal of the "Resurrection".
No respected international company will even put a bullet or poison there because it is at risk of losing its business in the EU, the United States, Japan, in countries that have acceded to sanctions against Russia on Crime.
"There is, in my deep conviction, no prospect for this project in fact," said Peterenko.
He added that Russia felt unable to carry out a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia is unable to construct even less large objects regularly.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, all the stadiums have already been destroyed.
“I therefore believe that the best instrument in this situation is sanctions against companies that have become so unlikely to join the project,” the officer noted.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of the building of the Kram bridge.
On the Kerchen coast, the complete collection of the road ark of the Crimea bridge is completed: its structure is closed at 45 metres from the construction.
"At the same time, the builders prepared for the installation of the railway ship's paints," they reported at the information centre of the project.
In April, Chief of Mintrans Max Sokolov informed President Rosie Vladimira Putin that the construction of the facility was due to a plot.
The Crimean Bridge will unite the Crimean Peninsula and the Krassandar region.
In Spain, a worker who didn't work for 10 years was fired
What English tolerance (or absolute indifference to public service) was to be held by the head of Spanish officer Carles Resio?
The permanent threshold has grown for 10 years.
In fact, Mr. Resio was still released.
But not his direct leader.
What's not happening in the world is bureaucratic.
The inhabitants seem to have been accustomed to all the jokes of "the servant of the people" for a long time.
Nevertheless, officials are always surprised by their fines.
This time, the "sensitation" appealed from Spain.
There, Valensia Carles Resio, an archaeologist, had been foolish for ten years not to go to work.
At that time, he received regular complaints.
I'll tell you everything that's solid is $50,000 a year.
And then Mr. Resio's "miracle times" ended.
He was released on the decision of the Valencian Legislative Assembly.
The investigation revealed that every morning the criminal prosecutor came to the office at 07:00 to mark the electronic system.
And here he went home.
Once again he appeared at work at 16:00 to re-notify what he had taken.
And that's 10 years.
It was also known that the speaker devoted all his spare time to drawing comics at home.
Members of the Valencian Legislative Assembly are now considering how to punish and direct Mr. Resio, who could not know how to "work actively" at his workplace.
The Courts propose protection from the presidents
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HRHR) under the direction of Vladimir Putin developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
SPC proposes that the powers of the Presidents of the Tribunal be limited and that they be elected.
For the courts of the Appeals and Cassation Tribunals, the SPC would like to introduce special areas that would not be involved in administrative and territorial activity in the RF.
The High Court should also submit its proposals within the presidential order.
The SPC has completed the development of proposals that will enhance the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by SPC on 3 January 2017 by Vladimir Putin, who was appointed by the President after a meeting with members of the Council.
At the meeting with members of the Council on 8 December 2016, a number of cases of judicial leave were discussed, as well as issues of public control in the places of detention of civilians (see " E" of 9 December).
As a result of the work, 25 proposals have been made to ensure the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the Presidents of the Tribunal to increase the independence of the other judges.
If a candidate for a judge has successfully completed a contest and has received support from the judiciary, the President of the Court should, in the opinion of the PSC, submit him to appointment without the right to refuse as permitted by the law.
It is also proposed that the President be deprived of the right to distribute cases between judges.
This may be done by experts, a specially written computer program.
It was also considered that the President would not have the authority to " predict the results of a judge's qualification test, to initiate his involvement in disciplinary responsibility, to take decisions on the establishment of additional material payments".
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to "the election of the Presidents of the courts by their own judges" and "to exercise their powers for a relatively short period of time with compulsory rotation".
All the Presidents of the Tribunals (from Republican to regional) are now appointed as President for six years to be represented by the President of the Supreme Court of the RF.
In order to compensate judges from the pressure of regional administrations, ICHR proposes to reorganise appeals and cassation in the courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to administrative-territorial activity in the RF.
The SPC said that “it is necessary to ensure the organization of individual courts of appeals and cassation bodies, not at the level of regional judicial bodies, but in the courts. ”
Experts are based on the practice of arbitral tribunals.
They have a "judgment area" that does not correspond to the Administrative Division in the RDF, but which ensures greater independence from regional officials who have difficulty using "telephone law".
World judges of the HICP are invited to strengthen the national chairpersons to consider with their participation some of the “civil and administrative categories”.
For example, the loss of parental rights, the return to work, the protection of dignity and dignity, the loss of driving rights, etc.
"It's just our proposals," explained a member of the SPC, Judge of the Constitutional Court of Tamar Mortakova.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate was not only to the SPC but also to the Supreme Court (CHR), which had not yet made its proposals.
There is still time for implementation of the mandate of the CS (among the executives, the Genocide and the human rights authority in the RF).
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effective the IMF is to ensure the independence of justice, President VS Večeslav Lebedev should be held by 1 September.
Living a high life: Flights and smart designers turned this little apartment into a living room in Earls Court
In 2014, Joan Lee, an ex-banker who was involved in the repair of the property, moved from a space house in Naitsbridge to an Erles Court apartment.
The apartment is on the first stage of the sympathetic typical house in Queen Anna's style, and in the benefit of the new design, it says that Joan didn't collect her things and didn't move again.
“ I used to live with my ex in Naitsbridge in a much larger area, ” says Joan.
"I wanted something comparable to my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high-rises here.
I fell in love with her and offered her the price on the same day."
Since the first review of the apartment, the area has been fully reconstructed in 1,000 square feet.
This was a room with one bedroom complex – to fall into the bedroom, had to pass through the kitchen – and Joann wanted to add space to store the items and furniture so that she could enjoy the maximum benefit from the gift of her generation.
"I wanted high waves, big windows, lots of worlds.
These were my requirements," she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from Notting Hilla's Architectural and Design Studies Duck & Shed to use a 12.5-foot-high pool and build a house that would not only be a successful project but would be a year for Joan to live.
The tunnel was not high enough to build two spaces above each other, so the architectural task was to create a landfill where full growth could be possible.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the bridge.
“Working with solid structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We had to have rooms so that they could be above each other and not be lost.
It was not just necessary to build a simple platform, but rather to avoid constructions to be at the right height and allow space to be used above and below.”
This decision allowed Erfan to build two complete rooms over each other in the remote area – and still very interesting.
With a semi-trailer, a winding glass light window from Retrouvius opens a kind of narrow guest down.
The silver furniture with the gold department, silver accentuates and windscreen lighting equipment from Serge Moya are designed for the style of the project.
The use of the circle plays a role in increasing lightness, space and light.
A short corridor will be lined up with circles to say it's longer.
On the kitchen, the side panel looks like a window in another room.
At the entrance of the circus cabinets, Joan's entire business is being preserved.
In order to create a feeling of more growth, the beauty of the guest can become a kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new in the kitchen.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's moving up the door like in the garage.
“Erfan has been engaged in engineering here,” says Erfan about an armored wooden-walled protective door.
"It's covered with a covering, so when you knock it up, it's very easy to swallow."
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage space, Joan received additional 16 square metres, additional bedroom and improved planning.
“In the end, the area of sex is what you will sell, that is what your real estate is estimated to be,” says Erfan.
“In a harsh manner, an insolvency trade agent will come in and produce accounts on the basis of the sex area”.
Here they have been able to increase the area by using quality materials that provide a growing area.
“Material is what we draw, so they help build emotional relationships with the home,” says Erfan.
“No one likes electricity in walls.
It is important, but it does not affect the flow of our hearts."
This is evidence that, in the light of a good design and an increased search for the apartment, it can become something that is common.
Actually, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of the Cultural Policy Commission
The Government of Russia approved the establishment of a State Cultural Policy Commission.
The relevant regulation was published on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the Commission ' s main objective will be to develop and correct strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify the objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The Main Committee is appointed by the Vice-President of the RF Government.
The composition of the Commission will be approved separately.
In 2016, RF Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved a plan for the implementation of the State Culture Policy Strategy by 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and provides for measures to increase the influence of Russian culture in other countries, to preserve a single cultural area and to promote the development of cultural conditions in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries declined to an eight-year minimum
Consumer prices in G20 countries have declined to minimum values in the last eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, referring to the OECD data.
According to OECD estimates, inflation rates in June 2016 were 2 per cent lower in October 2009 when the price growth index reached 1.7 per cent.
Previously, Rostat reported a decline in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1 per cent.
In this way, the public has established the first weekly deflate in 2017.
The rate of inflation in Russia, according to Minfina, is 4.1 per cent.
Mining economies, however, believe that the target value has already been reached - according to the version of this publication, the figure is 4 per cent.
Warning path from illegal deletion of the bivalve tag
Russian leader Vladimir Putin, during the meeting on environmental development in the natural bivalve territory, warned of the illegal destruction of forests.
In the course of the activities of the Minister of Natural Resources Sergei Donski, he noted that a bill had been prepared earlier.
It allows the forest to be disposed of at the time of fire and the Government plans to adopt it as soon as possible.
In turn, the President stated that the project had to be followed so as to “not all be removed” in the process of deletion.
Donkey noted that this bill was intended to be controlled by ICPs and supervisory authorities.
Media: VSU combatants secret from the command are negotiated with Donbassa
On the line of armed resistance in Donbasse, a regular telephone connection has been established.
Fighters against opposing parties are always in contact with each other on mobile phones, and they are not aware of this in front of the audience.
VSU fighters and Donbass militias have set up hundreds of secret phones from their high command.
On 4 August, Sparta.ua reported reference to the military operations in Donbassa.
According to the release, the unit commanders are well aware of the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them by telephone every day.
The community is not at all home: the commanders are trying to reach some “tictic agreements”.
Some of these discussions resulted in a transition to a specific front.
Journalists were aware of the cases when, on the day of their birth, one or more of the officers received from their official enemy because of the front line.
WSU and DNR and LNR fighters are in line with the end of August 2014, when Ukraine launched a fight against Donbassa.
The MDG has blocked UN statements on attacks on the IMF mission
The Russian Foreign Service is repressed by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives who block United Nations Security Council statements in the press condemning the terrorist attacks of the IMF mission in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian IUD.
The Bureau recalled that the territory of the Russian Mission in Damascus on 2 August three times a month had been subjected to a minor explosion by the terrorists of the Hayat Tahrir Ash-Sham (former "Jabhat An-Nusra", banned in the RF) and the Ar-Rakhman file.
Bearing in mind that the international community is united in the status of "Nursa" as a terrorist organization and UN resolutions call for opposition to this structure, the MD RF stated that "it would be clear that "Nursa" should meet with a general and decisive condemnation and that there should be no ambiguity in the evaluations against diplomatic missions."
However, as the Diplomatic Mission stressed, “in the third time in a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United Nations Security Council, Great Britain, France and Ukraine, have obviously been reluctant to express objections, covering evidence of any lack of necessary information, blocked the Russian Federation's proposal to adopt a standard draft Security Council statement for press with a view to condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital”.
The refusal to show diplomatic solidarity with us would leave us with the conscience of those delegations.
"The most disturbing of all that the Security Council's inability to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to feel impunity for new provocations and tactics," they stated in the IUD and added that "it would not be necessary for those conflicts to create the belief that someone in the Security Council would join them."
Vladimir Putin said that the number of unplanned business checks was limited
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, at an investment meeting in the Middle East, said that the number of unplanned checks should be reduced to 30 per cent of the planned, and also said that it was necessary to limit the time limit for the 10-day inspections.
“Integral checks are usually carried out without agreement with the prosecutor; only 2-3 per cent agree with the prosecutor, the rest goes alone,” quoted President TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that it was necessary to prohibit investigators from using servers and hard disks on businesses.
In addition, the President believes that business associations should have the right to protect the interests of their members in court.
"I hope that a certain position will be taken in cases related to business activities or violations of the law in the field of business," the head of State said.
As "E" reported, the number of other types of inspections of business operators is increased due to the action of the moratorium on plan checks.
In May, at the order of the Business Ombudsman, the President of Russia, Boris Titova, conducted a survey that revealed that there was actually an unplanned replacement of planned checks (from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), prosecutors (16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), regular (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), as well as civilian statements (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).

The brothers are fighting for the impotence of more than $500 million
Two brothers fought for one of the largest in Victoria’s empires in trade, worth more than $500 million, 40 years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and founder Colin de Lutus live in the Turkish court through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed an appeal against him in the Supreme Court for the division of powers and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court still has a serious dispute about divorce conditions.
Together with his mother, Anna, his brother, owned 87 items worth more than half a billion dollars purchased since their family bought a Smith Street store in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew up in a network of 160 trading points.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was placed in real estate, and the list of family holdings of De Lutus includes today's office buildings, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments in the Gold Coast and in Mount Bulller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
According to the agreement with the late father Colin, whom Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutus family, he has about two thirds of the company's assets and about one third.
According to the court, this means Colina's property is 316 million and Paul 176 million.
The property and money section became a stumbling stone to Paul.
"The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my view, the best parts of property," he wrote in his first statement in 2015.
Last Friday after several failed peace attempts, the first hearings were held in the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business, from which Colin believes Paul has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not the case, but blames Paul for some of the unauthorised management of certain objects.
In the evidence given by Colin at the beginning of the process, he said that he hoped for a solution to the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me think the family is the highest priority," he wrote.
The court costs are rising as a result of hundreds of pages of evidence, electronic letters and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer; both sides attracted the most famous lawyers, including King's lawyer, God Mayers, and the best rappers.
Ms. De Lutez and her retired husband, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; by the end of the 1950s, they were managing milk bars and restaurants, and in the early 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family store of gins.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last classes of school, and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says that they and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to transfer their property to children without conflict.
"Ludiji has often told me that he doesn't want my brothers to understand in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis' company; Colina says that Mark got 10 million when he left business and Luke 26 million.
Paul, Luke, and Mark said they were "unsatisfied with the financial conditions of their office".
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL Club Board and, as published in 2015, the biography of Eddie McGira, the best star.
The "Ferfax Media" on Friday was connected to Colin and Paul and their lawyers.
He replied only to Colin, a text message saying that since the case had not yet been considered in court, "The truth is very much to tell me."
"I am very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to seek me and demand our family's name in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote that he was trying to meet the requirements of the brother.
"Our father wouldn't want to see how Paul and I were arguing in court," he said, adding that "there is still hope for a resolution of the conflict."
On Friday, that hope appears to have been shattered.
"The decision on our case will soon be handed down by the court," Colin wrote.
The new head of the trampa apparatus is planning to limit access to information to the President.
Others tried to do so and suffered defeat.
Maybe John F. Kelly's gonna do it.
Then he'll be the first.
"Politico" reports that the new head of the White House apparatus is planning to limit the flow of information coming to President Trumpu, including news from the media, with the hope of keeping the head in a more peaceful position.
That's what reporter Josh Douzie reports.
"At a meeting held by the new head of the White House apparatus, John F. Kelly, with the management of the apparatus on his first working day, he identified the main problem in the White House with President Donald Trampe, which he hoped would solve: the bad channels of access to information to the President."
Kelly told staff that information should be passed through him - in a book form or through a briefing - because the President would better make decisions if he got the right information.
Diagnosis Kelly is perfectly faithful, but others have already suffered a failure in trying to calm Trapa by following his information.
President Trampa's relationship with television had lasted a few decades, and now that he is in the White House, his habit of watching television is still strong.
"When Trapp, a candidate, complained of the campaign's unfair lighting, it was useful to show him that he had received a fair light in publications that could be won," said Sam Nanberg, former electoral adviser in February.
Tara Palmeri then wrote in "Politico" that "by the words of the six former members of the electoral table, in order to maintain the habit of writing on Twitter, there had to be a constant stream of praise in coming personal information."
All right.
But the idea that Trampa used to write on Twitter was "under control" was just funny.
Maybe these members of the electoral board know something we don't know, for example, that if they didn't, they'd be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump hasn't published.
If his staff protected him from trouble several times, their efforts would not be futile.
But no one was always able to keep Trapa from oil spilling into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in a White House divided into opposing factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by giving Trupa material - reliable or not - which confirms their views.
"Politico" - as once in this history - wrote in May about the willingness of the advisers to constantly brief the President with suspicious information.
One example is described by the reporter Shane Goldmaher:
“The current and former staff of Trapa say that Trump may respond very badly to negative press reports, especially with dangerous information flows, and will not rest until they are found who has been behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone posted an article to the President with GotNews.com, an Internet-provocator site, Charles K. Johnson, where the deputy head of Katy Welsh's staff accused her of "standing behind a few escapes" in the White House.
It is important that Johnson is forever banned on Twitter for aggressive conduct, that he has not presented specific facts or that he has in the past made false accusations and then rejected them.
Trump read the article and agreed to ask his colleagues about Welsh."
Goldmaher adds that the then head of the Reins Pribus apparatus and the secretary of Rob Porter's device "was trying to build a system to manage the flow of the book that is received by Trump and document it".
How did it work?
Three months later Kelly tried to do the same.
He may be more effective than Pribus, but Trampa still has an impulsive nature, and its assistants are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly very difficult.
Tumena Procuratora v. HIV Dissident
The prosecutor challenged the decision of the Kalinin district court of Tumeni, which had ended the criminal case against the local population with which the young girl had been killed by HIV.
According to the study, the child died because his mother was HIV-dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from liability for reconciliation with the injured father.
The Office considers that the crime cannot be left undemocratic in order not to create a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against the inhabitants of Tumeni was raised at 1 p. 109 UCRF (the cause of death by accident) in April - after the death of her three-year-old daughter from HIV infection 4B.
According to the procurator, the mother itself is HIV-infected.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that there was no HIV infection," explained the Tuman District Prosecutor.
The criminal case was carried out in the Kalinian neighborhood of Tumeni, which decided on 25 July to terminate it.
The request was made by the father of the lost girl, explaining that “he has forgiven a woman, she has no claim to her, she has hurt herself and apologized”.
The Court ' s decision did not agree and appealed, requiring the decision to close the case and re-examine it.
The girl died, and the crime committed cannot be eradicated.
The HIV-infected mother, in spite of the doctor's recommendations, refused to investigate and treat the child from a dangerous infection," the prosecutor's press reported.
The supervisory body considers that it should be punished or that other HIV dissidents follow its example.
As told at the TDB, about 12 children with HIV are currently not receiving medical assistance due to parental rejection.
"And this situation has already improved - in the year of the work of a special group of parents who have categorically refused to treat children from HIV, have changed their mind - allowed diagnostics to become ready," said the press secretary of the Centre for AIDS Elena Loseva.
She said that it was impossible for parents to be legally affected, and as a result not all HIV-infected children could be found, mothers would not be able to investigate them, hide them, run away from the hospital.
How dangerous are HIV dissidents?
At the end of last year, peterburg sociologists presented the results of the first study of the so-called HIV-dissident movement in Russia.
HIV dissidents call people who reject the existence of HIV and refuse to take drugs.
Doctors and health activists of the NCO call such views anti-medicine, and their distribution poses a serious threat.
The heavy photosession that ended the tragedy took place on Thursday, 3 August, at the Greek railway station in Hemmelnik.
The happy company of young people who were under the influence of a bridge over the railways, where the train stopped once.
One of his friends had the idea of making an effective seat on the vehicle, reported Factam in the Hmélnic police communications sector.
The couple began to get out of the bridge on their way, but because of their indifference, they were trapped in the power line and were hit by the current.
Fortunately, this incident became known as the station's dissident, which immediately called the emergency.
Before the doctor arrived, the injured man was transferred to a safe place and then hospitalized at the Hospital Hospital in the Himelnic district.
Men were diagnosed with 1-2 levels of tuberculosis.
Now his condition is considered stable by the doctors.
Lawyers remind us that in recent times there has been a growing popularity of extraterrestrial cells on cross-sections, bridges that transport.
The police call on people to be cautious and not to allow such photo sessions, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the existence of oceans in ancient Venezuela
There could be oceans in ancient Venezuela.
French scientists expressed such a view.
Scientists have created a computer model that has demonstrated the process of water education on the surface of the planet, says Science News.
It has been found that in Venezuela, at the beginning of its history, oceans were formed with 10 per cent more water than at present on Earth.
Previously "Arguments of the Week" wrote that, according to scientists, ocean 4 billion years ago could also exist on Mars.
Foreign experts during their studies concluded that the water facility was located on the north bank of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured by the shooting in the park in San Francisco.
Three people were injured by the shooting in San Francisco, and the Associated Press was transferred.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park when there were a large number of visitors.
According to the Witnesses, several men at the bridge began to pose threats.
One of them took the gun and started shooting at people.
The appearance of criminals could not be considered as if they had closed everything except their eyes.
Another one was given medical assistance after his release.
The third victim is a minor, and there is no details about him.
The Dolores Park is a popular place for local residents and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured during a night club in Little Rock City, Arkansas.
Several more visitors were injured trying to leave the room.

Louna is one of the group that has been set up on the Russian rock scene.
The collection was founded in 2008.
Their debate was held in 2009.
The group has won several times in the various nominations of the Hit Paradox "Four Duggin".
Cigarettes crossed the river and returned to the “Millions Road ”
Some of the most complex households in the West Midland are once again in conflict with the strong Gypsies that have overcome the municipal authorities of the rivals to re-enter the field with their homes.
Cigarettes rented 20 homes on bicycles in a field bordering the rich streets of Solikhalla, which received a deceptive name “Millions Roads”.
Bringing the bad ones, young people and many homes on wheels, they returned after they had been driven out no further than May, and did not interfere with the rules of the municipal authorities to prevent their entry.
The tactical company found a break in defence equipment and pushed its vehicles against the bulk of the premises that were left unencumbered to leave room for the tropics.
Deprived residents attacked the municipality of Solikhalla, saying that it had become “unsolved to solve this problem”.
An anonymous local resident reported: “They came here on Monday evening after they left Benley Het, where they threw rocks in the past.”
Municipality should be respected and enforced because they are not fully able to solve this problem.
The tigers were here in May, they were chased away, and here they came back.
Last night there was even more cygan, and maybe even more today.
"Municipalities of Birmingham know how to solve this problem, they get long-term judicial decisions to protect their parks," she added.
I live on Streetsbruck Road, and I don't like to continue paying municipal taxes, and the municipality can't even end this."
A local resident who wanted to remain anonymous said, "This is funny. We have just seen these chigains go on for the last time, and here, please, this attack continues."
And this time they were more numerous than these, and We found in the land how evil was the place of return!"
The representative of the municipality of Solikhalla said: "We know of the illegal camp on the ground on the road to Stritsbruck and we work with the Solikhal police; we take the necessary legal action to get them out as soon as possible."
To help us in the field of witnessing, it is very important that as many local people as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the telephone police.
This allows us to make a presentation of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Kram shares the Champagne wine plant "New World"
The GUP of the Republic of Crimea "New World" decided to act by turning the "New World" Treaty into the OAO "New World" Treaty", followed by the order of the Minister for Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anuhina.
100 per cent of business shares will remain in the property of Crimea.
The capital of the shareholding society will amount to 595.5 million and will consist of 5,955 million traditional shares at a nominal value of 100 rubs per.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if there is no means of modernising the enterprise within the next three years, there would be a threat of halting the business.
The main export of funds to the enterprise is 60 to 70 per cent.
In order to modernise an enterprise it needs $1.2 billion. In particular, it has to pay 50% of its revenue.
What remains is insufficient to implement the modernization plan.
“Preparing money from the owner is a challenge, talking about attracting the funds of major credit organizations difficultly,” said the mayor of Crimea Sergey Petelin in April of this year.
Parliament of Crimea included an enterprise in the privatization forecast for 2017.
It was proposed to take action and put it on the market.
The Interfax source in the authorities of Crimea estimated the possible cost of sales of businesses at $40 million, investors' investments in modernization - more than $30 million.
The New World in 2016 increased the production of played wines by 2.8 per cent compared to the 2015 level to up to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017 the New World planned to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by High Priest Lövo Golicin as a wine-producing plant in the name of the New World.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
More than 40 graves were buried by the lower secondary classes
GU MVD staff in the Netherlands have identified individuals who have destroyed 46 graves in the city of Liskovo.
The perpetrators were students of the third class.
The first statement that the megalic plates were damaged by unknowns was made in the Russian Federation on 27 June.
In all, 24 persons were contacted by the police.
As a result, a criminal case has been initiated under article 244 of the CFR “Construction, damage or rediscoverment of the place of burial”.
As a result, the police established suspects, two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
Young offenders reported to the police that they were interested in seeing how the memory fell, and that prompted them to act as Hullingan.
Children and their parents have been given preventive measures.
Italy has increased its tone of reference to NGOs' rescue ships.
Italy warned NGOs that rescue courts in the Mediterranean would not be able to continue their work without new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not submit a new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they can continue their activities," said the Interior Minister Mario Minniti in an interview with the Turkish daily newspaper Stampa.
The warning of Miniti came the next day after the Italian authorities confiscated the ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet, suspected that its crew was actually working with human trafficking and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has been working all year, has rejected comments on the substance of the allegations made against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartozio.
“There is a survival of human life and will remain a high priority for us, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue to work in the search and rescue area now,” the organization stated in the series.
"We can assess all the charges now, only after we collect all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities are following the Juventa ship, owned by Jugend Rettet, in October.
Its crew is suspected that the entire lifeboats were on board those migrants who were sent directly to it and allowed the smugglers to go along with ships they could use again.
At least one such meeting is expected to be in 1.3 miles from the Libyan border, as is confirmed in the case of allegations published in the Italian media.
The team is suspected of violating the rules of the Italian coastal authorities that control rescue operations in this area, rather than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct assumes that the Juvente-type court will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue operations agreed to sign the Code: "Save the Children", the Maltese MOAS and the Pro-Activa Disseminations " from Spain.
The last Thursday stated that the new rules were unnecessary but acceptable provided that they did not bring any “significant changes or breaks” to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there was also the Nobel Prize for the Free of Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Miniti said that the sharp decrease in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support the Libyan coastal security and cooperation with local measures would produce fruit.
"In the last few days we have started to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
It reported plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mercenaries on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
"In Libya we don't want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict."
The IMF authorities have recently made a significant contribution to their policies towards Libya, and with visits to Moscow, delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have been invited.
The head of the Russian Intreviation Contact Group at IDF RF and Gosdoma, Assistant Chief of the Czech Republic, Lev Dangov, told "O" what goals Moscow pursues in this region and for whom it is responsible.
The contact group on Libya you're leading is almost unknown.
Here's what the contact group in Ukraine knows about.
And here's the secret box.
What are you specific about, what goals are you pursuing?
The contact group was established on the initiative of the MDR and the State Word.
Its activities are supported by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Michael Goddanov and Adam Delimhanov (P.D. of Chechnya).
The latter is authorized to work on the Libyan direction of the Spokesman of the Lord of Glory.
As a result of the formation of the group, the Russian tanker Mechanik Chebotarev was detained in Libya (in September 2015, there were 11 persons on board. - "O".
We were thinking about how to help the trainer.
At that time, a contact group of military specialists, representatives of Gosdoma, was established to support our work by Chechny Ramsan Kathirov.
How did you find out that you were leading her?
As I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been invited to take the lead in the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of seafarers from Chebotareva Mechanika.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups that are opposed to each other in the Libyan conflict - and by Tripoli (based on the recognized United Nations Government in the head of Faiz Saradje. - "O") and Tobruc (a residence of Parliament opposed by the Government and supported by the marchel Halifu Haftara, which controls the eastern regions of Libya.
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (Livian Vice-President "E"), we were able to make a rapid agreement on the release of Russian sailors.
It was then decided to make more effective use of these contacts to establish a contact group.
Its task is to analyse the circumstances, identify key factors and games, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to stress in particular that in Libya we do not want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict, we are having a dialogue with all of them.
How many people are in the contact group and how many are in Libya?
There are now five persons in the contact group.
Among them are people with experience in violent structures, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also wish to include a group of experts on the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East RAN.
There are no staff members in Libya all the time, and there is no need to do so.
There are now Russian military advisers, instructors in Libya.
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All discussions and publications on this are not relevant.
But in your contact group, the former soldiers are...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or they are closed to a certain point for us in the city like Misurata (where we are based on relief teams that played a role in the dedication of Libyan leader Muammar Kaddafi in 2011 and were significantly activated in the following years).
We arrived in Egypt in January of this year.
We were scared, they said that there was a lot of Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyze the real military capacity that was responsible for why such hearings were actually the role of Islamists.
In Misurat we met with all the representatives of the teams involved in the destruction of IG in Sirte (in December 2016 this city on the Mediterranean Coast was killed by the fighters banned in Russia by the Islamic State).
We wanted to see them get to know these people and check out that they were playing a decisive role in the destruction of IG in Libya, not Halifa Hafttar, who attributed these services to themselves.
And what conclusion have you reached?
The Islamic State in Libya won not Haftar?
That wasn't him.
Haftar was operating on the other side of the border in Benghazi.
And IGs in Sirte fought structures under the Government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we have invited people in Russia who have carried out this anti-terrorist operation.
They came to visit from 19 to 23 April of this year, and the Libyan delegation was hosted by the Federation Council, the Duma, the Media and the Rosary.
As we have seen, you live in all the Libyan regions and probably represent local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to conclude agreements on the ceasefire, the elections that took place at the end of July in Paris, Halifa Hafttar and Faiz Saraj?
Or, once again, as has happened several times in the past, will the agreements be broken, the fighting will be resumed, the parties will try to seize power in one way or another?
For us, the fact that Sarage and Hafttar had agreed to a regular meeting has been a good sign has not yet been impossible.
In the past, both leaders have been very negative about each other.
With regard to Russia's position...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftara, many believe.
We faced this situation when they were in Misurata, and that is when Hafttar was on the Russian plane "Admiral Kuznez".
It was a coincidence.
But they didn't believe in a match in Egypt.
We were told, "You are very brave people who have come to us today."
But our task is to show that we do not just support Haftara, we are engaged in dialogue with all the key parties to the conflict in Libya.
You and Hafttar were together.
Does it make it easier to get along with Russian partners at the human, emotional level because he has learned twice in the CSR?
And, by the way, does Hafttar know Russian?
He's Russian if he knows it's very relevant.
But what he taught us, of course, makes it easier to talk to him.
And among other things, it's not just him.
When we meet with the military in Tripoli and Misurata, we meet with the generals who have either studied in Russia or still in the Soviet Union.
And that's how they speak Russian.
And they're going to Russia, some way they're testing it.
Do you consider the possible rapid abolition of the arms embargo imposed on Libya?
Are your Libyan counterparts interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
Of course, we are interested, but, as I have already said, we are not involved in this conflict on the one hand, and we would not want to arm ourselves against one another.
We would like everyone to be in the same position.
With regard to the arms embargo, the Libyans have always heard calls for Russia to make some use of its withdrawal.
The constitutional process is now being actively promoted in Libya.
We hope that the parties will make compromise decisions and have an internal consensus.
The elections should then be held as mentioned at the meeting of Saradja and Haftara.
If the elections are held and there will be a final election of a legitimate authority (and no one of the parties currently has such status), a question could be raised to the UN Security Council about the removal of the arms embargo.
Taking this issue seriously and dangerously now will only lead to an easing of conflict.
During the days in the media, information was received that Italy, facing the problem of African refugees from Libya, feels frustrated at the failure of EU union justice.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using its contacts with the Libyans?
For example, how realistic is it that the Haftara teams will establish border control and put an end to the business of smugglers moving immigrants to Europe?
I'll see you in time.
We're working on this.
The Italians need Russia's support because Moscow is engaged in dialogue with Haftar, Sarajevo, Misurat and the South.
In this respect, the tribe of southern Libya plays a major role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about cutting down the flow of migrants on further steps?
That's what I'm talking about. Is it really the bus back where Nigerian migrants go?
That's what we're doing.
But it's not just.
Some clans and groups are interested in continuing these flows.
We hope, however, to help unite the South in the negotiating process between Sarajevo, Haftar and the South tribes.
But for the first time, we would like to see the unity of opinion on this issue between Hafttar and Saragem.
The head of the Government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered a Muslim, party to the law of the country.
How many radical views does it hold?
Would that not be an obstacle to breaking up relations with Russia or the West?
I'll express my personal opinion about him.
In my view, he, on the other hand, is the opponent of radical Islam.
But Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country - a moderate Islamic, open-minded country.
He is also actively fighting terrorists.
How does he have such a reputation?
It was established by those countries that were not interested in bringing Russia into contact with Tripoli.
Tripoli is a capital where there is a legislative, executive and judicial authority.
National oil corporation, national bank and other public structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in not being there.
And we're all laughing at them, and we're starting to interact actively with Tripoli and Tobruc.
We are already aware of the results of this work: Rosneft concluded a cooperation agreement with the State Oil Company of Libya, NOC.
Director NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with which Rosnefty Igor Sechin concluded a deal, I am directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Lithuanian oil from Rosneft.
What will Russia do to her?
I think I'm gonna sell it.
What other economic interests do Russia have in Libya?
It is planned to sign contracts concluded at Muammar Kaddafi.
In particular, it concerns the past transport arrangements (railway construction), energy (electricification) and a number of others.
What about the Levites?
Well, they have oil.
Is that the same thing as with Iran about the oil exchange scheme?
I don't know what the scheme will be. I don't care about these issues directly.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not major.
We're actually doing peace work there.
For us, the main thing is to stop bloodshed, help the Libyans agree on one another so that they can establish order and Libya has ceased to be a favourable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task of helping the Libyan people and expel terrorists from there.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical combatants from Russia or other countries of the former SSR?
One of the objectives of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with the representative of the Libyan Security Committee, who said that there was no exit from Russia and other former SSR countries today.
He said he had some 50,000 phone calls from representatives of Islamic and radical groups (in Libya). "O" and the Russian word would not sound there.
What then are these states?
I don't want to get involved in these details.
Then we're making a different question.
How many of the Islamic fighters in Libya are the Levites themselves?
There are no Levites among them practically, not more than 5%.
The rest are coming.
Can Moscow conduct internal negotiations on the example of Paris?
There's such plans.
We are conducting active negotiations with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow and have expressed their willingness to come back to Moscow or to Grozny.
And when can such negotiations be held?
Now it's hard to say.
A number of visits are still to be made, and I hope there will be clarity about the time and place of negotiations.
At the Czech Museum, volunteers collected money on the street of a sick boy’s gift
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Macola, who has a CDD and a fully blind brain, will receive a gift on August 5th.
The Vice-President, Mr. Saše, was appointed by the Ministry of Culture of the Moscow Region of Oksana Kosareva and the Director of the Museum of Constantin Bobkov.
The trainer’s money was collected during the charity marathon “Do Not Give Up in Doing What Is Good”, which went to Melikho on July 15 on the Day of Jehovah’s Memorial.
The discovery of the marafon in the museum was obtained from Sashi, who lives in the village of Manuskino Chekhov, by writing: "I don't have any glasses, so I asked Mom to write this letter."
"I would really like to get into a gift of escape so my legs would be strong, and I'd feel like I'd learned to walk."
And here's Sashi's dream!
After the dedication of the curator's museum, there will be "Concert-PostScripttum" - a famous piano artist who, by the name of Russian artist Alexander Gindin, will perform performances from popular classical works.
At the time of the well-being march in Melikhov, the choir of the Woznesen David Forest, the famous Master Eli Droshin, the students of the Moscow Conservatory named P.I. Chiakkov and the Russian Academy of the Name of Gnessins, the artists of the Melikh Theater "Chehow Studies".
For visitors, auctions were held, bookstores were organized, and the sovery product was sold with a logo of maraphone.
The Mélikhovo Museum has taken the initiative to celebrate the Day of Chechov on 15 July, the only day of charity in all the museums in the South Pacific.
A 30-year-old resident of the Oliveska Jitomir area near the local football stadium has several times been shot at by the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was shocked by the noise, the Factsam reported in the Jitomir Police Department.
After that, the man went into a coffee shop right away.
In his building, there was a conflict during which a man used a device to shoot a reindeer, wounded one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old has been provided with the necessary medical assistance, and there is no risk of his life.
Police and early medical assistance were at the scene, but the shots were dropped.
The defenders established his identity and detained him on the same day, 2 August.
The man could not explain his actions.
It took the device to shoot the resinal pulses sent to the experiment.
According to this fact, criminal proceedings were initiated under section 296 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detained person is threatened with deprivation of liberty for three to seven years.
Remember, a shooting attack took place in Kiev, Lukayanovska, in the Tatarsk Street area on the night of July 28.
Trial by Michel Carter for reports of the suicide of Conrad Roya
Masachusets was sentenced to two and a half years in prison because she, through text messages and telephone calls, had motivated her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to commit suicide.
Michel Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to be 15 months of his term of office and another 5 years of trial.
In June, Carter was convicted of the attempted murder of Conrad Roy, who ended on 13 July 2014.
Father Roya said to the audience on Thursday: "My family was killed by a fire.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal.
She had been threatened with a maximum period of 20 years, but her lawyers said that she and Roy had suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in a red blouse and a clumsy shirt, heard the sentence stand, shake his hands, and tear his eyes.
"By her actions she killed Conrad Roya," said the prosecutor.
"She cut off his life to improve her own.
She didn't recognize responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any remorse."
But counsel Carter said it was "a tragic case she deeply regrets".
However, Judge Lawrence Monise said that her “age, age, or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions”.
The prosecutor read the statement made by Roy Linn Roy's mother, who says: "There has never been a day when I wouldn't cry for the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I am doing - I try to support his sister, despite all the pain that will last forever with us," he says.
Sister Roy Camdin Roy said she was constantly pursuing the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become the aunt of his children.
"To leave the man who has always been with me since my birth is the pain that will last with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case is likely to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that would provide for the Human Rights Council to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roya was in the car with the symptoms of gas poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The attention of the whole country was drawn when it became known that it was being subjected to the suicide of the letter of Carter.
"You can hang out, hang out, hang around with a knife, I don't know there's a lot of ways," she wrote in a few reports sent two weeks before his death when he retired with his family.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You just have to put on a fire, and you're gonna be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to take care of Roy's death and prevented her from talking to the press so that she could not get what she wanted.
The views of the jurists in this regard were divided.
One of the few who protected Carter was Amanda Nox, who was sentenced in 2007 to murder in Italy by his British neighborhood neighbor and was sentenced to two years later.
The 30th-year-old Nox published his special opinion in Los Angeles Times, which stated: "Michael Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Eugenia Bogachev: "I let Langford go as a high-fly bird."
One of the best basketballists of the single VTB League, 33-year-old Kit Langford, has left UNICEF.
The U.S. defence officer " Emissions " commented by the President of UNICEF Evgen Bogačev.
China has taken this decision under family circumstances, Eugenia Bogačev told her.
He's got a little boy, a woman who didn't want to go to Kazan.
Kit wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go meet him.
Of course, I could say "no" and extend his contract, but he deserved another relationship.
He played at UNIX for three seasons and demonstrated a high level in each match, at 100 per cent.
That's why I let him go like a high-fly bird.
We thanked him.
We want him to succeed in his family life and in his career.
Kit Langford played in the Danish club for three years, joined the same league in 2015/16.
In the 2016/17 season, he won a prize for the most successful game in the European season.
He got 21.75 glasses in the middle of the match.
This result has been the second since 2004 when this prize has been established.
Langford, also awarded the prize in 2014, became the second player in the history of Eurolia, which won this award once more.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with the Chinese "Schenchgen", informs Eurohops.
It is expected that an American will conclude a two-year contract of $5 million.
Langford will become the second star of Europe, which will be transferred to the Chinese championship.
Previously in China, CBA had moved to the "Pantiniacos" ex-Central Jannis Buruss.
A tourist's sunburn in the South Pacific evacuated a helicopter in Adige
The Athenians today evacuated from the mountainous region of the undersea tourist’s most powerful sunglasses.
The man went to the farm "Fisht", located at a height of 1.6 thousand feet.
The 27-year-old tourist has increased pressure as well as difficulty breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescuers were approached by a tour team leader who told them that the man's injuries had begun.
Audi should be modified to 850 000 diesel cars
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW stated that it would propose updating software for more than 350 000 cars.
The President of BMW stated that the company considered that “there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions”, including European cities – including Munich, where BMW is available – which considered the possibility of preventing or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Dimler stated on Thursday that it is modifying three million Merdès cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
Not one of the companies called her step-by-step.
European car manufacturers actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with carbon emissions rules.
But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered cancerous and can cause asthma.
The value for car manufacturers of the installation of equipment that neutralises diesel exhaust gases is also increased and the competitive price on the vehicle is difficult to maintain.
While Germany's car manufacturers are under close control, the Government of Angel Merkel's Chancellor has also charged that it is affecting the car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
The companies are trying not to repeat the “Folkswagen” errors that have destroyed the use of what is called “impairment devices” which could manage the amount of greenhouse gases emitted during testing to comply with the rules and are excluded under normal driving conditions.
Several Folkswagen leaders were convicted in the United States, and the rest were followed by both sides of the Atlantic.
In the past month, Germany arrested an former head of the thermodynamics department in the Audi engine development team.
Former manager, Zackeo Jovanni Pamio, Italian, and therefore not protected from extradition and may appear before a court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was under German criminal investigation with the participation of Folkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of establishing a system for the treatment of European emission rules and expanded the investigation that had previously been focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may create serious problems for Folkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is a relatively large proportion of the Folkswagen revenue.
A coffee visitor in Asrahana paid for false money
The police received a report from the bank's office staff on the money transfer from the public through a suspicious buyer of 5,000 rubles.
A study carried out at the Centre for the Experimental Crimes showed that it was false.
As reported by the UMVD of Russia on the Astrahanic Area, one of the visitors to the coffee shop was paid.
It is noted that the case was not equipped to determine the true nature of the purchase.
The police are currently establishing persons who are involved in the production and delivery of a separate CB RF ticket.
Such crimes are punishable by the deprivation of liberty for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the TIR calls on the people of the Astrian region to be careful when financial operations are undertaken; it is recommended that trade facilities be set up to verify the trueness of the funds received.
The astronomers found a "dark" planet on which even iron can flow
In the first study of the properties of the giant planet's stratospheres called WASP-121b, astrophysics were not surprised by its temperature, which was able to melt iron and other metals.
Experts have noted that water molecules are so exposed to the light of the stars that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope has sealed the water molecule on this gas giant: this high temperature forces water into the atmosphere of the planet to shine in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "burning Jupiters" gas giants, sizes and mass compared to the largest planet of the solar system but located ten times closer to the parent star.
As a result of this year, only 1.3 "earth" days are spent on the planet, and its gas surface is nearly 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit [- 2,500 ° C].
Climate change threatens the well-being of Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but it is now threatened by climate change.
Lawanda has grown worse because of droughts and infectious diseases; this has been the cause of the constant head injury of scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, says: "Lavanda in Provence is in real danger because in recent years this growth has been affected by climate change: heavy rain has been much less severe.
It affects the life expectancy of lions.
And there are still small ticks that come along the leaves that carry micro-bacterials; in very dry weather they become very much."
There's a lot left on the map.
The lavender is not only attractive to vacationers; the lavender oil is very popular in perfumery and cosmetics.
Eric Six says: "In place of very long hills with a large number of large flowers, we have small, undeveloped, weakened or missing.
So we have fewer parts containing efficiencies."
The decisions currently under consideration include improving the distribution of water and slowing down of soil, as well as the freezing of crops of the protected mixture of soil and water and the removal of more sustainable species of dry land.
Ambassador of the University of Winter - 2019 met with schoolchildren
Two times the World Championship on hockey, the Ambassador of the Winter University of 2019 Alexander Semin met with shock at the beginnings of hockeyists and gave up autographs for patients.
The meeting took place in the autumn of 2019 in the context of the theme week of the series on hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could walk on the horses on the floor with an artificial needle.
In addition, estaphets, victors and games were organized with the playing of the so-called study games, a break from the Aerobic Federation.
A total of 50 students attended the event.
Alexander Semin advised children as much as possible on sports fields and stressed that the most important at the early stage of education was hard work and a desire to be involved in hockey.
"Well, in Krasnoyarsk there is an area like the Black University of 2019, where beginners can ask questions directly to team trainers," the champion said.
It is noted that promoting student sports and healthy lifestyle among lighthousers helps Ambassadors of the Winter University of 2019.
Shutter of the University will work for the entire summer season until 25 September, reports the Press Service of the South University Directorate for 2019.
Medvedeva’s comments were made in the House of Lords
The official representative of the U.S. Department of Health Hizer Nawart, commenting on the briefing by Prime Minister RF Dmitria Medvedeva, said that there was a need to find "power for interaction" with Russia.
In her view, such areas should be found to “increase bilateral interaction”.
For example, the successful cooperation of Nawart called for a peace agreement on Syria.
We're two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia must be able to work with each other," the diplomat said.
Nawart therefore refused to comment on Medvedev ' s approval for a fully-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has spoken like this, she will, of course, have the right to speak, but I can't say anything more on this subject," said the representative of the Gosdepa.
Former President of the United States, Donald Trump, signed a bill on the enforcement of sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new sanctions package, the head of the RF Medvedev Government stated that Washington had declared a complete trade war in Moscow and had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvej also stated that the United States sanctions would be in force for decades.
In addition, he considers the Prime Minister to be the American "clean player" of Trapa.
The missing one in the Sub-Moscow Bibilder found lost memory on the outside floor
Bodibil Shamil Hanmetov was on the way to Noginsk on 25 July under very picky conditions: he got out of the car room to go to a toilet.
Seven days he was unsuccessfully sought by prominent and local residents.
And there was Shamil on the other side of Ramensk.
He found himself completely big in his toilet shop.
The Georgian sportsman couldn't explain what happened here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember what his name was and the passport was missing.
Establishing a identity has helped announce his propaganda.
The medical authorities who came to Hanmett's hospital for partial memory loss and brain trauma, reported the Republic of Mash.
Probably sportsmen are waiting for other surprises.
The criminals who attacked Shamila were likely already in his apartment, where he was also robbed of his keys.
The oil revenue in July exceeded the forecast of 7.4 billion rubles
The actual gains from oil revenues as a result of July 2017 were overestimated at 7.4 billion rubs, reported the Ministry of Finance of the IMF.
The overrun, as the public explains, had occurred at a higher exchange rate of US$ than the average value of June used for assessment, as well as in excess of the actual amount of gas yield and exports of forecasted-level petroleum products.
"The withdrawal of the federal budget from the monthly assessment of the federal budget corresponding to the Federal Budget Act 2017-2019 is estimated at +40.2 billion in August 2017," stated Minfina.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated for the purchase of foreign currency on the internal currency market from 7 August to 6 September 2017 is EUR 47.6 billion.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign currency is equivalent to $2.07 billion.
The Bank of Russia will be attracted to the acquisition of foreign currency by Minfin Russia.
Each working day during that period, the CB will conclude the purchase of foreign currency on organised markets in Moscow's market in the same manner as during the trading day.
The foreign currency acquired will be included in the Federal Value Account in the Central Bank.
The killing of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Officials of the Riodos newspaper usually meet in the middle to discuss plans to expose the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa related to organized crime, corrupt officials or continuing war drug dealers.
But today, victims of their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told that they should change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed to be safer: to take the children with them to an office where they had already broken the grenade in 2009 or leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the desk in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name each column - evidence not needed, suspicions and internal feelings would be sufficient.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who suspect that they are in possession of government or cartels, a whole list of street vendors whose work in Mexico has become dangerous.
Violence does not prejudge, and among the bodies that are growing in the country, there are more and more journalists: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 times as President Enrico Pena Nito took his post in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection following attacks and threats; and at least seven people have died in seven countries this year.
Among the last ones are their publisher and inspiration, the inventor of "Riodos" Havier Waldes Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdes wrote in one of his many books on violent drug crimes.
His absence is very strong, although his presence everywhere is a large picture of Waldes, showing the middle finger, with the title “Justice” on the Riodose building stage; two reporters in the 30th year, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear shoes on which he is painted, face-to-face or his business pan.
The seminar lasts less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, their absence, their panic.
Although the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Journalist Investigation was organized in 2010, only two cases were investigated, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As in the case of most of the thousands of drug and organized crime murders each year, journalists rarely appear before the court.
Journalists of Riodos insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they have been killed in a forest, although around now is much more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice from security talks at meetings, Ibarra says.
"It's stupid to spend time at this seminar," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we're all suspicious."
On the morning of May 15th, Waldes left the Riodos office in the capital city of Kuliacana.
He was able to pass only a few quarters before his beautiful Toyoto Royal was stopped by two men; he was thrown out of the car and shot 12 times in it, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which means "Twelfth River".
The gunman went into his car and broke it away.
Waldes was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two grown children.
Listeners usually go to Kuliacana fast.
But about Waldes, it's almost all quiet.
Since Guzman was arrested and released in the United States in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody fields of war in the country, as opposition factions are fighting to fill the growing vacuum.
We will not talk about killing one or more people every day on the streets of Sinaloa or that the camp is filled with two - story drug nightmares, which are more than the homes of many living people.
Let us remember for a moment that the state of "peace" is simply when one of the cartels takes control of the marine state with the important ports and routes of drugs leading in the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Waldes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, 60-year-old inventor and director of Riodos, felt guilty that he could not protect another.
He thinks murder helped two errors.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso Lopes, the leader of one of the rival cartel factions fighting the sons of Guzman.
The publication could upset the children; people who were supposed to be members of gangs gathered all copies as soon as they were delivered in the kiosks.
The second error was that he did not force Valdes to leave the country for his own safety after the arrest of another newspaper, which reported the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was estimated to be a regular wave in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been away from danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter in Norway and in 2003 he, together with five colleagues, had sold his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without affecting the subject of drugs," Bohorques said.
In time, the newspaper earned the reputation of strong and honest publications, sales and advertising of growth.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports, not censorship, but that readers were attracted by what they could read in this issue about what no one had ever been able to write.
Eight years after his foundation, Riodos received Maria Murs Cabo's prestigious prize for her work as a reporter in Latin America.
In the same year, Waldes won the International Press Freedom Prize for the Courage of Mexico ' s Drug Investigation, wherever it may be.
He openly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to live further," he said to the CPJ prize.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "the picture of life," he said last October in a Rompevento TV interview.
"You have to take the tasks that are on you as a journalist - or you're just going to throw a hole."
I don't want you to ask me, "What did you do when there were so many dead around... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Ríodosse staff are shooting at Waldess, a liar who moves like a freighter at the port, another, generous at the invitation and advice, a teacher who knew how to make a living.
They relied on the order they had taken.
He should've always been wearing his shoe.
He had to go to El Guayabo, a bar against the office, and always sit there behind the same chair.
Now they ask: Has he lost his love for the order?
His death also caused them to doubt in their calculations how to better do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you understand their wives, their children, their legal business and their secondary drug transport facilities.
"These things were too bad," said Bohorkes.
As a result, even in the best of times, there was a high level of self-sustainment and self-sustainment.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from the bad smell.
The problem is, editor Ríodosse Andres Villareal says that "the argument can be false... and then what happened to Javier is happening."
Old rules, he says, and others no longer work in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where there is a burning mix of profit-based contraband routes, weak public institutions and corrupt officials.
Landshawf is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodos ' staff met for security training, hundreds of telephones had been banned: a few days before, it became known that Spanish programmes, which were sold exclusively to Governments, were used in Mexico for follow-up to journalists and public activists.
Two police units are covered in the shade of the tree of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius).
They were commissioned by the Government to protect the Riodos office, which is located in a four-story building in the Kuliacan district.
Some journalists asked whether these police officers included 50 per cent of the officers who were told by the governor themselves that they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists were sent to a densely populated place where they were actually under the control of a gang of drug dealers.
In the next issue of Riodos, three main topics were addressed.
It's a murder in Sinaloa's brother's former champion, under the box of Julio Caesar Chavez.
They still had government expenditure focused on the home city of Governor.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of Kuliakan's most expensive restaurants, in the district of the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who had been robbed or how this had happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it came to writing that everyone in town knew that it was a favorite restaurant for drug dealers and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from the open database that the restaurant was registered on the name of the policy of the ruling institutional revolutionary party (PRI), which dominated at all levels of authority over the past century.
A number of PRI governors have recently been charged with corruption.
Vilieral asked journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo was used by Guzman as a weapon of war.
A few months ago, readers would like the Waldes column with the most reliable information on theft.
"We'd already know what happened before," says 46-year-old William, for his artistic composition called El Flaco.
"Today all channels of contact with our sources are broken."
The Waldes office is now used as a warehouse for posters and posters with protestors against the killing of journalists, as staff have become what they never thought would happen: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went to the local prosecutor's office the next morning.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michocán to the west of the country three days after the murder of Waldes.
They found a frozen body, and the authorities said it was based on DNA tests.
All over the country, journalists have been publicized, organized protests, and written "SOS Press" on tracts and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., seeking international support in the demand for justice in Waldes.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the following day after the murder of Waldes Ramires, the authorities accused them of spying on journalists and ordering them to kill for telling the truth.
She then asked her not to give her more attention to the Government ' s activities, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Waldes has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "circulated" by organized crime, by its government participants and by a variety of societies.
In his last book "Drug Journalist " he wrote that reporters are not just killing drug dealer gangs; they are doing so by ordering policies and security services that are in agreement with organized crime.
The Committee on the Protection of Press " Article 19 " considers that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by police and government officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you down," says Ramires.
Of course, killings scare people.
They all remember the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Massias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body, she found a note, supposedly written by Zetas, "I'm here because of my articles".
The computer keyboard and keyboard were tied to her head.
Some publications preferred to close as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent Miroslav Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to be like El Manjana from Nuevo Laredo after her leader was killed in 2004.
In 2010, Díario de Suudad Hueres spoke to drug dealers using an editorial article on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their homeland or their country at all.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work out, and they're still looking at the danger on the streets.
And sometimes they're killed, as it seems, with a photo by Ruben Espinez, who was killed in 2015, along with four women in the neighborhood in Mexico three months after the flight from Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work are balanced daily between risk-related decisions.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a spy, admits that he was afraid to write about drugs.
"Mexico's falling into a coma, and that's why I've become a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, when the last issue was ready to be printed, the Riodose publishers sat on the counter with the office and drank beer when their cell phones were called at the same time.
A series of shootings between opposing gangs and security forces soon left behind the Kurdish city of Masatlan, according to confirmed data, 19 bodies.
The war continued to spread, as promised in the series of shipments from cartels discovered in this area.
Sitting on the counter, they posted news via the mobile phone on the radio.
The next day, we had to move the first page.
There's another shot in the neighborhood.
Bohorques saw if they were ready to defend their police.
If they were scared, they wouldn't show it.
Sitting under the huge portrait of the dead founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the whole Sinaloa, the Riodos staff continued their work.
"How can you think of closing up," said Bohorkes, "if the same day that Javier was killed, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street to report?"
The dinosaur used a compass to avoid enemies
At first glance, it seems to be a status, although it is a fear.
The researchers said that the first remains of an incredible substance were found in the noose size discovered by the Canadian chess team so well that experts called it "Money Liza among the dinosaurs".
It kept so well that they could even determine that the color of its skin was bright - and to say that it had, in some way, "the dark past".
The report published in the magazine Modern Biology described it as “the best preserved from Tireophor for the entire history of inventions and one of the best examples of dinosaurs in the world”.
This is the recently discovered nodozavre model of the mid-morrow period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredible good condition has led to researchers who call it “very remarkable”.
This trajectory is the most well preserved of this kind for the entire history of discovery, according to articles in the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Funk when he worked at the Millenium of Sancor near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He focused on something that seemed to be different from the environment, and he decided to look more closely.
Their excavated copy was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tirrell.
Over the next six years, there has been a work on finding an animal inside the soil mass of 2500 ft (1100 kg).
Now that all this hard work is done, the final result can be demonstrated.
“It is only easy to get excited, and it is practically possible to believe that it is asleep,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tirrell Palace Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
“He will come into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well preserved examples of dinosaurs – Mona Lisa among dinosaurs.”
A study of his skin revealed that this was harmful, although it was covered with a pancake and reminded the walking tank that it was likely a significant threat to the fleet of dinosaurs.
This heavily covered dinosaur pantograph used a white camouflage to get rid of insects and used a protective technique known as a protective shell, which is also used by many animals of our day.
This would allow him to get closer to the environment and avoid meeting enemies, experts say, assuming he was attracted by larger dinosaurs.
This presence of 110 million years of age related to the nodozavre family was widely recognized in May, and is now at the exhibition at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
The students had already studied the animal and gave him the name Boraelopelta markmitchelli in honor of the museum lab of Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours behind his scoundrel.
The outstanding preservation of the sample allowed Dr. Mitchell and the international team of students to document drawings and shapes of glass and paints on his body.
They discovered a protected circle, a wide range of protection in the kingdom of animals, which means that the top of the substance was darker than its lower side.
Although the protected area and well-equipped, the opening has become unexpected because the size of the Borelopelta dinosaur is significantly higher than the size of the now-living animals from the protected area.
It can be assumed that the dinosaur has been so moved by the fleet dinosaurs that evolution has preferred to mask the conflict as a way of survival.
However, most modern animals from protected areas — such as elephants, elephants or bronchos — are much smaller and are more accessible, as evidenced by the fact that nodozobor had come to fight seriously for survival.
“The serious threat by engineers to the massive, heavily covered denousur pancreas shows how dangerous it was for the melodic dinosaurs,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in carbon dioxide also shows that its skin should have been refined.
The students continue to study the animal, looking for information about its life, including the contents of its food tract, in order to find out that it was eaten during its last visit.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was thrown into the sea, where he sank and lay down on the bottom of the ocean.
At that time there was as hot as now in southern Florida, and the rivers and oceans, almost all of them, were spreading far beyond the dry.
“It is indeed remarkable that this nodose will cover the whole preserved skin and at the same time it will remain in three dimensions, maintaining a significant form of animal,” said Brown.
“As a result, the animal is now almost the same as it was then in the morning period.
It is not necessary to think in particular to raise it, it is only easy to get excited, and it is practically possible to believe that it is asleep.”
It was a period of time when giant terrorists, armed with dinosaurs standing on two legs, sailed on the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, Tiranoseur Rex lived for millions of years later than Boraleopelta, one of his terrible ancestors could have been killed on the theater.
These include acrocantosazer, a monster of 38 feet (11.5 m) weight in six tons.
Students whose recent discoveries are published in the magazine Modern biology believe that Boreelopelta was taken to the sea after death and ammified in hell.
The existence was found by Sean Fank, when he worked on the millenium near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to the museum staff, this is the world's best preserved tereophorus, along with skin and pancium, and its goal, from mortuary to poor bones.
On average, these substances reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
They were characterized by two twelve-year-old scarfs from the shoulders.
Researchers believe that this trajectory has been difficult because it is now Canada until a different river has brought it into the open sea.
However, the underwater destruction of the dinosaur kept its penicillin straight to the softer details.
The remains of this particular specimen have been preserved so well that the remains of the skin are still covered by the bungalow pans around the dynascal.
As Michael Greschko wrote in an article for the National Geographic magazine, the level of survival is “very rare as winning in lottery”.
The more I look at him, the more empty he seems.
The remains of the skin are still covered by bungalow pancakes covering the animal’s skin.
His right front leg is pulled down to the side, five fingers on it back up.
I can count the chips on his face."
Mikhail Saakashvili survived in Poland without documents
Michael Saakashvili, former head of Georgia, and then the Ukraine Odex area, a flight to Poland.
He did so without documents confirming his identity and nationality.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish version of Telewizja Republica, which posted a video on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili took part in the annual meeting of the Warsaw revolt against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since he did not know Polish, he had to speak English by means of a Polish translator.
In his speech, the policy was focused on Georgia's cooperation with Poland, as well as on Ukraine.
Ukraine ' s migration service has lost its citizenship, and the general policy has been recognized in the United States.
As he was able to complete a transatlantic journey without documents until he was unknown.
Former U.S. Governor Michael Saakashvili stated that his signature of an interview for Ukraine ' s citizenship had been issued.
The politician emphasized that he had not filled any polls.
Date of investigation in the case of Winziher and Olhovika extended until January
The period of preliminary investigation by the owner of the Renova Group of Eugenia Olhovic and the head of the energy pipeline "T Plus" Boris Weinzihere was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basman Court considered the extension of the alleged domestic arrest.
The representative of the COP at the meeting reported on the decision to extend the provisional investigation for the last time.
“The particular complexity and duration of the investigation are due to the need to exclude and conduct a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigations in the territory of several RFs”, the researcher stated.
He added that the suspects regularly provided the Commission's guidelines.
Their overall size is estimated at least one billion rubles.
According to the survey, Winziher, Olhovik, and former ZAO Head of Integrated Energy Systems, Mikhail Slobodin, who led the company Vimpelko by 5 September, handed over to the senior officials of the Commission for the establishment of maximum cost-effective tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for the creation of favourable business conditions.
Winziher and Olhovic were arrested, staged in Stydivkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin disappeared from the investigation and was declared a federal investigation.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question, "What are the streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was dragged to the very depths of the soul.
Just the day after arriving in New York during a tourist trip, St. Louis was sitting in the living room rented by Airbnb, looking at the Facebook page on the phone.
She moved to a post of someone from high school.
It was said, "The police have only killed an 18-year-old boy and he is still in the middle of the street."
I noticed that no more of her tapes had posted this information, she closed her Facebook and opened a Twitter.
There was a lot of user feedback in her tape with no @TheePharoah.
Reper of the Great St. Louis, in real-time mode, revealed in his tweet the death of Michael Brown, a non-armed blackout teenager killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's lifeless body, scattered across the street, where it will be four hours.
"It's thickness," thought Ferrel.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She stopped the phone, and later at night she came back to tweets about people being gathered on the Canfield Drive.
There were photographs of the signalling tape and screaming people and people who claimed that he was the father of Brown, who cried out: "The police from Ferguson just killed my gun-free son!"
She saw the direct transfer as the police officer stood before a group of protesters with a dog.
In another video, she said, "I'll kill you all... the animals."
"This is an unusual situation," Ferrel said in his own words.
“This is not a murder like the one we used to commit and what we can call typicals.
At the time, I felt angry.
I was angry and cried."
She took a ticket on her way back home the next day.
When she landed at 11 o'clock, she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided they were both going to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened with Ferrelle and Ferguson over the next three years became the theme of a new documentary film entitled "Who Streets?" that will appear on screen on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and loss, strength and endurance from the perspective of people living in the community and in the crowded streets, requiring answers.
While Ferrelle was riding in Ferguson with a daughter dressed in flowers and flowers under the flower, they mentioned a talk that had been said earlier this morning countless times, “on the experience of black people and their situation”.
She said, "Do you remember how I told you about the people of the black people who had come to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
"I couldn't take her," said Ferrelle later.
"What's going on today is a culmination of what happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it and think about it.
It should not only be understood well in the activism and organization but also understand the different levels of experience and their situation and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I can provide her with an environment where she doesn't personally face apparent racism, she's nothing different than any other black girl.
I feel that I would give her an evil gift if I were to take her away from it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made their first stop at South Florisant Road, on the area along the way from the police station, which was kind of a palace camp, while activists were waiting for reports of the result of the innocence of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrelle and her daughter joined the local businesswoman who made the package.
They collected packages and helped distribute them to their protesters.
At least in the knowledge of Ferrel has changed the form of a new type of activism.
“My activity changed completely after 9 August”, she said, noting that as a student of the University of Missouri St. Louis, she was the president of the Association of Sanitary Students, National Minorities, and dealt with food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
"I didn't have an organizer's experience.
It's just come."
After a few weeks at the evening show, Ferrell met Saba Folayan, one of his organizers.
Folajan said that she and her main operator, Lucas Alvarado Ferrer, "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrell asked: "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can play?"
This scepticism was spread by many people, often white people who came into the community to benefit from its pain and endurance.
As Folajan explained in a recent interview, “We have heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson do not fall into focus, and they wanted to do otherwise.”
Folajan has already joined his organizer Damon Davis, a local artist known to his activists on death row.
His participation raised sympathy for the project in Ferrell and six other local residents, with whom the project ' What Streets ' team had maintained contact over the years following Brown's murder.
“There is no one talking about us or about us in this documentary, we are talking about it ourselves,” said Davis.
“This was the most important thing for me, how these people will be presented, because this is how I will be presented.”
And although the project was not focused on Ferrell's experience, in an effort to show that the movement “is not about a rescuer, but about how the community is united”, as Folayan said, it proved to be the most open of the film participants.
As a result, the “Who Streets” showed unexpected personal aspects of Ferrel’s life, for example, how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrelle, laughing at how she saw the product for the first time.
“But I realized that when you do this work and you focus on black people, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell's story re-examines and accentuates the role of black homosexual women in a broader context of the movement “The Life of Blacks is important”.
Two of the three drivers of the movement – those who created the #BlackLivesMatter in social networks after the murder of Black Young Trevon Martin in 2012 – are gay.
“Black homosexual women in leadership positions support all this movement,” says Ferrelle. “And all because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexuals have to bear all this burden.”
Folajan agreed with this claim, noting that “the movement, in fact, is supported by black women and by many homosexuals”.
However, she insists that “it is not a case of positive discrimination”, and that Ferrell was not elected by the film's central staff because of its different characteristics.
"She was the man who woke up this energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that it happened first because when"
You can feel her energy through the screen."
At the time, there were no cinemas in Ferguson, but there were complex racial links between the community and the police.
Ferrel will be two and a half years away at the test time for the cover of the six during the demonstration.
It describes the social and political atmosphere of the place, which is called the home, simply “Bardak”.
She's still holding on to a sentence she learned when she went to Ferguson's street three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support one another.
We have nothing to lose except our bones."
Two Salvadoran footballers qualified for US games
The football team of Salvadoran Henry Romero and Darwin Seren received long-term disability for sport behavior.
At the time of the fourth final match, the gold cube of the North American and Central American football confederations and the Caribbean countries (CONCACAF) attracted the American players.
The first was the protector Henry Romero.
The Salvadoran tried the attacker, Josie Altidor, and then he kicked him out of his chest.
Then, in the case of a criminal offence in his area, Lieutenant Siren tried US defender Omar Gonzalez.
As a result, Romero was disabled for three matches and Seren for six.
The meeting itself ended with an American win with a 2.0 count, delivered by Goal.com.
Similarity: The artist creates portraits using DNA Chelsea Manning
In the center of the gallery of Fridman in New York, people from all over the world are attracted by white, black and useful people, all of which look like each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Hiser Dui Harborg from the pockets of the silks and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Menning sent copies from Fort Levenworth Prison, where an ex-exploration analyst is 35 years old for the so-called transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, covering 2 August, is called "Relatation of Conformity".
This is the result of a two-year record between Dui Harborg, whose art combines technology, information and art, and Menning, a woman transsexual and prominent dissident, which Barak Obama tried everything for three days until the end of his presidency.
By analysing and using the computer DNA program from Manning and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of people with this gene, Dui Harburg has created a deep, although difficult to detect a manifesto that concerns not only the plasticity of DNA data - different ways of their interpretation and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, but also the perception of identity.
Menning, who was born named Bradley Edward, but since she was a teenager, has openly said that she was considered a woman, 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Act on spying, computer fraud and fraud.
Her photos in prison were not available, so only one of her photos was known: her black and white selfie, on which Menning felt clearly naked, sitting behind the wheel of the car; she became associated with it.
In 2015, Dui Harborg successfully completed its 2012 project "Vidence of unknowns".
The artist created portraits of unknown people using the judicial role of the type of whores and the fungus, drawing from this mustache of DNA and creating images of how these people might look.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to depict the article," Dui Haggburg explained in a preliminary presentation of a new press exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea was unable to visit and photograph, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a photo from her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her inmate in the museum became friends on record and exchanged letters for two years.
They even wrote a comic book entitled "Founded Images", illustrated by Shoil Canunga, who described how the President would in the future alleviate Chelsea's punishment and be able to visit the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning all within a few days of the release of the book into the world proved to be a pleasant surprise after seven years of hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and powerful and that the exhibition is being opened right now when Donald Trump announces war on people who disclose secret information to the Government and develops new ways to survive on Twitter the enemy he is calling for to soften.
When Dui Harborg asked about this all over the time, she said that "there's nothing at all."
In an artist's statement on the gallery wall, the great Menning signature (with heart rather than "i" in her family) calls for the end of "automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the other hand, it is its methondrial DNA, a long tissue from C, G and A.
In addition to 200 letters (or nucleotide, as the artist has been researched in science), Dui Harburg hoped to show how we all look amazingly, in any case according to its biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our gene does not determine how we are, how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey Harborg; her 2007 video work "Low memories" is also presented here.
"The DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of the exhibition held in one room is the above-mentioned novel in comic books.
It has Menning in the King-Kong style on the building of the U.S. Correctional Caesars with a speaker in hand.
"If they kill your word, they'll win," it says.
"That's why you never shut up."
"This is the direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says an artist who welcomed us from Philadelphia.
"I still have a scar on my skin when I'm talking about it."
Menning hasn't seen the exhibition personally, as it was seen in the comic books, but when she comes, she'll welcome the masks in the center of the room, her own gene symbols collected, literally from the protesters.
This is also intended to be done, as is the case with the 5-2, Menning growth, on which genetic groups have been formed.
"I'd have let them out on the walls before, but now I wanted them to look like a bunch of people," says Dewey Harborg about the portraits.
"I want them to be like a mass movement formed around Chelsea as a movement that stood for her release."
Professor North-West University and Officer of Oxford University are investigating the murder police
According to the police, there will be a national board of professors of the North-West University and staff of the Oxford University, who are investigating as suspects of the fact that the population in Chicago has been killed.
According to the Cook District Court's protocols, orders were issued on Monday for the detention of alleged murder without the right to release under the custody of the 40-year-old Windem Latama and the 50-year-old Andrew Warren for their alleged participation in the death of Trenton, Mr. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, 20-year-old Cornell Duranlo died after having suffered numerous injuries.
The warning issued by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was found on 27 July.
The police called, they came to the Grand Plaza apartment complex and discovered the victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell Duranlo had been declared dead at the crime scene, and now the detectives were investigating death from knife wounds, considering her murder, while the police were looking for two suspects.
Latam has been in the position of Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of the North-West since 2007.
Alan K. Cabbage, Vice-President of the University of Communications, reported in an e-mail statement that Latam is in administrative leave and that he was prohibited from attending the campus of the North-West University.
“It is now a criminal case investigated by authorized persons, and the North-West University is cooperating with consequence,” said Kabage.
Warren works as the senior financial officer of the Oxford University financial institutions.
The representative of the University and Somerville College reported on an e-mailed statement: “We have met with the United Kingdom police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the United States research bodies”.
The statement also stated that colleagues of Warren were shocked and wanted him to leave.
The head of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guelmi, said that he was very advised by the suspected authorities.
“The police have assumptions about their location, but our efforts are being made to find them,” Güllmi reported.
According to Gullemi, local, regional and federal authorities are assisting in the search for suspects.
According to Gullemi, the police called the Grand Plaza building administrator, who had just received a secret report on what happened in 1008.
The police called the crime scene a terrible place.
Güllmi reported that it was not clear whether the incident occurred on July 27th.
According to him, video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latama and the victim are related to the relationship,” said Gulemmy.
The Grand Plaza Guide issued a call for staff who reported: “The police are currently working on the history of the incident, collecting information on the victim and considering several reasons, including possible domestic events”.
Russian Vice-President Mutko: "We meet the requirements of the road map of VADA in the near future"
The Russian Vice-President Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Dumping Agency (WADA) to resume the work of the Russian Anti-Dumping Agency (RUSADA) would be met in the near future.
"A certain phase in the implementation of the requirements has been passed, and RUSSAD has the right to plan and carry out tests in conjunction with UKAD (the anti-doping agency of Great Britain).
The VADA road map was updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the road map of ADA on the restoration of the status of compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the renewal of the work of RUSSAD and has recently been published on the organization ' s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that might present difficulties for Russia.
"All has been announced, everything will be done.
The results will also be presented to the International Olympic Committee (ILO) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian Andydoping structures should publicly acknowledge the results of the investigation by Canada's Canadian lawyer Richard McCarren, who claimed that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the State.
With regard to this issue, Mutko said: "We know the investigation because our anti-doping system has allowed itself.
All measures were taken.
But there was no host program, and we won't recognize what wasn't."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitalia Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Social Anti-Dumping Commission.
The same morning, in the Russian edition of Rsport, Simirov recognized the earlier situation in the Russian anti-doping structures, but he added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain positions and conditions.
No one will ever accept this report," adds Simirov.
WADA removed RUSADA from the control of doping in November 2015 after the doping scandal.
However, in June of this year it was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Duty Agency (UKAD).
After the visit of the Moscow office of the organization in July, the Director General of WADA, Olive Niggly, said that RUSSADA "was moving in the right direction" to resume its work.
Fire extinguished in the 79th floor window in Dubai
A large fire that occurred in one of the highest residential buildings of the world, The Torch, a quiet one, is being sent to Reuters.
It is noted that fires have been managed with all fires up to 4.00 per local time (3.00 ms).
The local authorities reported that no one suffered as a result of the incident.
At the time of fire coming from the sky, the street was covered.
The causes of what happened are still unknown.
It was previously reported that The Torch, one of the highest buildings in the world, is the 79th - floored building in Dubai.
All the houses were temporarily evacuated.
Inadmissible addition to the Buz-Buzon-dreaming: non-cash-covered bridges
The scandalous driving reality show "Dom-2" by Olga Buzova defeated the audience of the European Plus Live festival with dances in the desert.
In the eyes of thousands of worshipers, a new song with Nastaya Kudri performed the song "It Will Be Hot".
Both girls went to the stage in the provocational "brokes" that were cut off so that a lower white song appeared.
Buzova and Kudry were written on paper.
It was previously reported that a specialist in Moscow’s plastic surgery was commenting on changes outside Buzov.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
On Friday, 4 August, the Radio 4 News Service reported on the reference to foreign media.
He said that the Russian authorities were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO gender also criticised Russia for the situation with Crimea and for the destabilization of eastern Ukraine.
At the same time, Stoltenberg believed that dialogue with Russia, however, was possible, and the further deterioration of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump stated that the relationship between the United States and Russia was at a very low level and accused the United States Congress.
Metro Ekaterinburg wins a new way of paying
In October the flight to Ekaterinburg Metropolitan would be possible to pay for a bank card, OAO Director I-Net Paul Vedernik said in an interview with the District newspaper.
Our goal is to introduce the 2018 World Football Championship to the same system of travel in metro as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, New York and Novosibirsk.
"We want patients from other countries, mondialle guests, to be able to use metropolitone using their bank cards, not acquired concretes and not standing in the middle," he said.
Starters that will help your company not become regular Ober
Emmy Eritrea wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among its e-commerce staff, but the surveys were not working.
The answers were often frustrated, useless, or even more inexplicable.
Even though she had promised anonymity, some staff members did not believe in this process.
“He was never consistent and objective,” said Eritrean, manager of the San Francisco company of 75 Madison Reed, dealing with electronic hair care trade.
So she turned to third parties for help.
A new type of start-up in the field of working with staff is now emerging, which helps companies to understand how their staff feel.
By developing and licensing software for staff involvement, they allow companies to express their requests to certain teams and demographic groups, to provide anonymous and fuelling lines for complaints and, in some cases, to allow informers to pass the group and address directly.
“We now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, founder and president of Redwood City, whose analytical programmes are used by companies to measure staff involvement.
Errett told me that she had gained a greater understanding of what her employees thought and felt within three years of using Glint.
In addition to the requests and questionnaires of certain team members, the product offers a warm map of the company and shows in a monitoring format which units have more complaints and which managers have a low rating of approval, which enables it to understand why.
At least the companies realize that they need to control the situation at work, otherwise they will become regular “Uber”, which appeared to be in the scandal when an former staff member posted a post in a blog that described the aggressive situation in which those who had expressed a lack of satisfaction were punished.
For starters like Glint, this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for profitable business.
The Internet portal estimates that over $118.7 billion could be spent on financial technologies, global management, regulation and compliance by 2020.
The Convercent in Denmark, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a small increase in interest and activity earlier this year on the basis of Ubera's reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber appeared among clients.
Like Glint, Convercent, allows companies to send individual staff questionnaires, collect confidential responses in real-time mode, and watch hot maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hot line for anonymous text messages that allows staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints will come directly to the address.
"The Court of Public Opinion has seized the authority of inspectors," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it is found that the company is dealing badly with employees or is acting in an ethical manner, even if the inspector is not involved, the company may be affected by the costly consequences of the client-side boycotts, the source of staff and judicial claims, Quinlan reported.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants where over 25,000 staff work in 500 institutions, has used Convercent over a year to ensure that staff are in the course of rules and procedures and to propose a simple approach to the company's headquarters.
Earlier, if a staff member wanted to report on the problem, he or she had to ask for a telephone number or an e-mail from the head office to file an official complaint and hope that it would be treated seriously.
This was often a frightening and awkward experience reported by James Vitrano, the head of the Ruby Tuesday legal administration, who said it was not a normal way to track down staff complaints.
At the same time, when the Convercent service is used, problems that have previously been tackled by managers who have been sitting in offices in other cities or states such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay can be detected and dealt with as quickly as possible.
"I can approach the full, comprehensive understanding of the situation of staff," said Vitrano, who is headed by the Ruby Tuesday Network Risk Management Group.
“And we protect our shareholders from court proceedings with staff.”
According to Queensland, companies began to deal more seriously with the ethics, values and involvement of staff in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting company suffered from ethical violations as a result of Della Enron.
But only when “social networks got mass distribution”, companies realized that they could not keep their green protein from viral distribution on the network.
“Before we started using technology to control ethical people, we used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking from companies regular payments for their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity to gain the approval of venture investors who supported both start-ups.
In February, Convercent received funding of $10 million from such companies as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, resulting in a total company's capital of $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, resulting in a total company capital of $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising if they take into account the interrelated nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
A growing number of studies show that today's staff expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In markets with intense competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, this is only a minimum.
Staff members want to know that they are receiving and appreciated and that they are spending their time with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in a company, they feel that they are listening and that the work they are doing brings results, they are more likely to make such a company a success,” says Nina McKwine, Vice-President for Global Benefits and Satisfaction in LinkedIn, where Convert and Glint are used.
Investors get income when business in their portfolio is good; business in companies is good when employees are transferred and involved.
If third-party analytical instruments promise to increase the performance and involvement of staff, it is no wonder that they are supported.
It is important to have data on the involvement of staff, as noted by cultural experts in the workplace.
But the data are useless until the insurance companies take action.
In fact, if the company asks for feedback from staff, it can create an impression that changes are needed.
And if changes do not occur sufficiently quickly or do not occur at all, disappointment can develop, and staff will lose interest.
“If you are going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you must be ready to make 4,000 bees,” says Russell Ratt, president of the Kotter International Management Company, who had to see how companies made a mistake by relying too heavily on data collection.
If you do not come to the end, the people will say, "Did you listen to me?
Aren't you all right?
And if you're the same, why shouldn't I be the same?"
According to Eritrean, Madison Reed, who is currently conducting monthly staff surveys, is able to take action on the same day when someone is reporting the problem with Glint.
And after receiving feedback from staff members, insufficient speed of decision-making and quality of communication, she was able to reorganise several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday received new knowledge about its staff and hoped that in the long term these knowledge would help it to keep its staff in an industry that was well-known.
"If you do not try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
A new asphalt on the Krasnoarmei prospectus in Barnaule
In Barnaule, cardiac measures have been taken to address the causes of asphalt damages on the Krasnoarmei.
The place where they emerged twice on a recently-fledged passage (the cut off from the Youth Street) was decided to "get up".
Remember, the destruction of a small part of the road near the tramway was due to land degradation in the area of an unexploded network.
According to the Vice-Chairperson of the City Committee on Road Economics, Goods, Transport and Communications, Ivan Garmatt will conduct a detailed survey to investigate and eliminate prejudices.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that non-hospitable communications will need to be restored and their bettonization will be restored.
This is reported on the official website of the local capital.
Commander Bruns has to work longer because the National Student Sports Association has canceled twice a day's training.
The time is close to eleven o'clock; a group of footballists from the University of California in Los Angeles is being held to pay for the new training fields of the camp.
Some of them took off their shoes and beat their backs after the heavy first day of the sports camp.
For many players, these minutes of play are a break in the middle of the day.
The games recorded for summer work, after three-hour training, will go back to the community to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning they will return to the Vashserman football centre at 6:30.
Not long before Monday turned Tuesday, the trainer, Brines Jim Mora, said: “In the next three days these kids are waiting for mesorub. ”
The fact that the National Student Sports Association has abolished training twice a day, which was intended to reduce the burden on toys, actually has reduced their working day – at least until the end of Friday’s exams.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of the California University of Los Angeles team were scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to take place in and out of the round schedule of games.
The absence of two trainings per day increased the number of days with one training, and Bruns started camp almost a week earlier than last year and held training during the summer school for the first six months of Mori season in Vestuda.
They are scheduled to carry out 18 trainings by 20 August, including prior to starting formal training for the first game in the season against the command of the Texas University A&M in September.
It had to say that it supported the amendment of the rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that another item had appeared in the game schedule.
“In three or four days we will give them this huge load, this is a serious test,” said Mora.
"And they have passed it over, and they are working, and they are the children of wonder.
I think when we live by Saturday and have more time, it'll be really healthy."
When the camp is completed, the California University of Los Angeles is training closed; this is not an easy task, as its field is directly visible from the adjacent park and from the Laskin Center, a street hotel that has already been bombed by football bullets crossing the gate.
Games from Brunss should start at the hotel from these exits, but Mora admits that when rooms are free during the season, a problem may arise.
"We'll be safe," Mora said.
“This is a serious problem, and I am not overhauling the danger, assuming that someone can remove the room, sit there and record the training on the video.
If you have video-protected training, it's very serious.
But we'll be safe there and safe in park number 8.
We're doing everything we can with what we have.
I'm not going to survive too much.
We have a plan."
All those who suffered from the treatment in Petersburg were taken out of the hospital
All those who suffered during the strike at the St. Petersburg Metro in April were taken out of the hospital.
This was reported in the press by Deputy Governor Anna Mitjani.
According to data at the end of July, there were three people left at the stations.
Remember, the explosion of Saint Petersburg on 3 April of the current year.
The bomb hit a terrorist death bomber Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result, 15 people were killed, as well as the executioner himself.
According to the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer of Abro Azimov, were arrested.
It is recalled that Rosporebnadsor recommended that the Petroburg Metropolitan review of the transport security plan, in particular by increasing the number of metallicators.
Facebook strengthens the fact-checking in the fight against Facebook News · Global Voices
Facebook will often send texts that are suspicious of the ambiguity of independent experts and show their findings under original posts, the fourth largest social network of the world, which is trying to combat so-called fictional news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was starting to use improved machine training algorithms to identify possible ambiguities, send them to check and possibly show the results of the fact-chaking under the original post.
Facebook has been criticised as one of the main ways of spreading so-called fictional news that many believe has influenced the presidential elections in the United States in 2016.
This issue is also being discussed actively in Europe after the French voters have been misled by false reports before the presidential elections in May and in Germany before the September elections, they have declared support for the plan to punish social networks if they do not immediately remove hate-free posts.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook reported testing of a new fact-chaking algorithm, which was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing what communications are contradicted by independent verifiers, people want to have a broader context in order to give reasoned judgements about what they are reading and what they are doing," wrote Sarah Seu, the Facebook news tape manager in her blog.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of "related articles" and work on other changes in the news chain to address the issue of fictional news.
Creating a Roman-Committee: One Lock in English History
In the recent short prison in Scotland, Skeeze was taken out of the music video and served as a port for Margaret Tetcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But 700 years from his quiet place in the Bay Valley in the county of Kent, he saw a turbulent history around him, and now he inspired Jamie Rods, a Yorkshire hairdresser and a keener in historical documents, to the novel comex.
"I think it's so beautiful - to look at the human face that died 300 years ago," he says excitedly.
"You feel it so personal when you keep this letter in your hand."
"The castle in England" covers a period from the Middle Ages to the Evardian era and tells of families living in Scotland; each story is illustrated by one of British young artists - Isaac Lankevic, Brian May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhodes, based on archive data: in 2014, he wrote "Dubbes of the Dead and Other History" as a collection of British Library documents; this project unexpectedly extended it to the depths of the soul.
"I could just print my finger at the end of a letter written in the 1700s by a two-year-old Jacobite agent," he said.
"It's a print of his finger."
And the letters always smell like smoke, because at that time they burned fire for lighting.
And in 300 years, in the future, you'll be told that you're there too.
Oh, how I love the archives!"
It seems too good to be true for a person who has been so passionate about the old books to receive support from the National Fund and the English Art Council and to live in prison for four months ( "Truely speaking, I've just been there for a while").
Rhodes studied the "new" Victorian castle all day, went to the archives, and looked at numerous treasures and old things - for example, the cave's head on the walls or bottles, which have been in the hole for centuries.
He went to the park and to the ruins of an old castle, talked to foresters, farmers, and sometimes artists who worked on illustrations in his book.
Then at night he "drinked whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of Scottni castle has not been studied very much because the National Fund had access to it only in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassi, died.
When Rods arrived ten years later, his staff only began to understand the archive he described as "that aristocracys had fallen to the heart for centuries".
Journals, letters of time from the British Empire, maps showing who owned them: "You think the land disputes are boring," says Rods, but there were two families behind this wall.
That's right, boys!"
In some history, the castle collection has become a starting point for more extensive research in English history: for example, in the "Robtornike", the hero is from only a castle built to join the Christian Revolution of 1381.
"There is information about the rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380 in the book "Kenta's family and Saxexa "," says Rods.
"The Christian resurrection began in these places, and I thought that rebellion was an appropriate beginning.
Maybe they've been tied up?"
Other alliances are closely related to the history of the castle, for example, the "Sacrifice", which tells of the priest-Iezuite whose family had been living in Darrelov for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Contrabandist" about 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who reportedly recorded his own funerals, bought a grave with stones (it was discovered several years after the tomb was buried).
Darrell is a beloved family of Rods of all who have lived in Scotland: "The gentlemen seem to have been perfect July, they've been in debt forever and spent money on what they couldn't afford.
In various generations of Darrell men have solved their debt problems, getting married to wealthy older women - I represent them as a sympathetic company of guys who are capable of caring for large-scale heirs."
After the end of the work in the Rods castle, there will be other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He lived two weeks in a Finnish audience, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elamymaki -- a place where the sun began in the early 20th century, and then it was again ruined by forest.
But Scotney remains a special place for him.
"I was so rude to go," he says.
"I felt like I'd have to get back to real life."
Fifteen largest banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Russian Banks Association (ARB) develops: after Sberbank, WTB, WTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gaspromban, Rosselhosbank, Binbank and FC, seven other credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
As a result, at least 80 per cent of the market will be available to the ARB organizations.
But this is not just an exit - all banks that have declared a break with the ARB are negotiating with another public institution that combines credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks of Russia, which is headed by a well-known policy of Anatoly Axak, the President of the Committee of the Gosdus on the Financial Market, recognized to be, at the end of the last session and the most effective head of the thought committee and MP on the number of draft laws.
The beginning of the internal conflict within the ARB was at the time of the discussion in the Federal Council when new legislation had been reviewed by the Interregional Banking Council, in particular by a new classification of banks depending on the size of the capital.
Mr. Garegin Tosunyan, President of the ARB, then said that, in the view of the association, this bill was adopted in the interest of larger banks, which were thus attempting to limit the possibility of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by overcrowding their customers.
Among other claims was the criticism of the Central Bank, which, in the opinion of Tosunya, was not always justified by the withdrawal of licenses from some banks, which, in fact, resulted in an objection by the representative of the CB: many of the leaders of the banks who had disappeared, in particular the Bank of Exprompts, were members of the ARB's governing bodies.
It appears that this exchange of views is mutually exclusive in relation to the main bank environment regulator and has become a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks to be inconsistencies with the ARB policy and to prepare themselves to join the Association of Russia, noting that "the effectiveness of ARB's work is at a low level and that the constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually taking place".
I'll make it better for the players.
What's going to happen?
We are quick to answer the main issue that arises in or around the banking sector when a minor dispute or conflict arises: nothing will threaten, rather, the bank system's confidence will increase.
“Rossia” Anatoly Axakov, known for its excellence in the interests of banks and their clients, is a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Centre: virtually all CB leadership is involved in the annual activities of the association, and all significant regulatory legislative initiatives are carried out through the expert evaluations of the “regions”.
It is clear that there are no special concerns in the staffing plan.
Indisputably, the ARB falls into an uncomplicated financial and administrative situation after such powerful and influential participants lose their contribution and lobbying opportunities.
However, in 1991 an organization that is of interest to the banking community had little capacity to continue to improve banking legislation and the scope of money-laundering as a whole.
It cannot be said that, even in the Russian Association with widespread objections, the judge of its leader, Anatolia Aksakov (“maybe too much”), who, on 21 July at the press centre of the Parliamentary newspaper, stated that “the next day, the representatives of the ARB banks asked me to consider the potential of our Russian Association”.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council and to give more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiating process is now under way, and the proposals of both parties are under way, and an extraordinary meeting of the association will take place in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of the International Bank Forum.
That's where we'll figure it out.
Anatoly Axakov also stressed that "the cross does not hold its hold", calling on the possible new director of the updated association "Rossia" Georgia Luntowski, who left in September the post of Vice-President of the Centre bank, highly characterizing its business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Axakov, who is now staying in Crimea, plans to suspend his leave and arrive in Moscow for one day at an extraordinary meeting of the Association Council of Russia, which is intended to consider the agenda of the emergency meeting of Russia.
The entry of a gas engine into the major cities of Russia will not be limited
Deputy Chief of Mintrans Nicolai Ass Saul stated that, despite media reports, cars with petrol engines in large Russian cities would not be restricted.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept must gradually increase the environmental class.
And that's where the concept of going to zero.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is, which year?
That's the same thing as the laser phrase -- let's stop it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
The whole city is closed?
"In 20 years, I don't know, maybe that's gonna happen," said the Minister.
The previous issue reported that, by 17 August, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovic was commissioned to study proposals on possible options for support for electricity transport submitted to the Government by PAO Kamaz Director Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, on paper information, was the use of DVS cars in major cities and on corridors.
Washington is changing the rules for receiving a credit card.
According to the media, President Donald Tramp said that a new U.S. immigration plan would be adopted, which would change the rules for receiving a credit card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants up to 50,000 per year, more stringent rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in two Congress Chambers.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and will do so in the light of changes in the distribution of U.S. pensions to nationals of other countries.
The law will reduce massive migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new process of reporting statements will benefit English-owned candidates with financial resources that enable them to keep themselves and have skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump, according to the American media.
The appearance of the sex robots is real, and that should bother us.
We failed to think that 2017 could no longer be worse, a new report on technological success in the production of sex robots.
Mm-hmm.
Sex jobs are now at the center of attention.
The FRR has recently issued a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
In the view of Noel Sharki, a professor of engineering and artistic intelligence at the University of Sheffield and the FRR, we should refer to their appearance.
Users will be able to choose the color of the work eye, the shape of the fruit and the type of leg.
"People are smiling about this, but companies are already sending their consumers a great deal, and we will soon see them much more," Sharki said in his presentation to the new report.
Modern sex-cookers have evolved from their enthusiasts in works of silicone skin, warm to breath, and almost human responses to artificial intelligence.
Users can also "smooth" their work by their taste by selecting all of the color of the eye and the shape of the fruit of the work to the shape and color of the leg.
But the fact that many work has a “number” compared to which Stepford's woman would be very progressive, is even more concerned.
Modern sex-cookers have turned into Silicon leather.
For example, the RealBotix robot company allows users to find the quality robots they find attractive, for example, worthy.
There are other sex-workes of Roxxxy Gold, developed by True Company, which are already programmed in individuality - for example "The Cold Fair" produces impressive impressions and "Dikya Wendy" has a "brain" character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that suits you well," reports the website True Company.
That's why she loves what you love, doesn't love what you don't love, and so on.
She's changed her mood during the day like this man!
She may want to sleep or cry, or she may "be in the mood"!"
There are many concerns about the phenomenon of sex robots - not recently because they replace real human relations, but most of all, women's under-responsive form, association with rape, which is causing the possession of the Cold (read: against) Fari.
The "True Company" Roxxxy website compares to the electoral system, for men only.
"If women (sic!) can have a choice, why can't men have Roxxxy?" says the site.
But these sex jobs are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity indicate something more darker and deeper in our culture, a deviation from the idea of gender equality in the area of sex with an optional addition.
Most men will not, of course, buy sex robots, and although the FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain in the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the profile may be very scientific about the meaning of the era in which we live.
And many people are not stupid and aggressive until the free market has given them the opportunity to do so.
That is not to say that these complex sex acts appeared when women's rights throughout the world were threatened when there was a president in the White House who praised what was going on with women.
The most horrendous in the series "Serving of Servants" is not graphic images, bodies and eyes painted, i.e. how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is an overcrowding, but it does not seem to be this big anymore.
The aim of the sex robot industry is to achieve this physical image for real women (with only the proportion of porn stars), which allows technology.
Their creators want them to tell people how to copy the movement of the human body.
But it's not like these women.
They can't communicate with their partners or leave them.
They have no life or biography -- nothing that could indicate independence or something else that could destroy the illusion of complete independence.
In other words, it's beautiful.
Or, as they say in 2017, servants.
The Los Angeles Jujin (Puch) Geter, who has been speaking for Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European basketball team, which will start on 31 August.
In this connection, BeBasket, at the Portal, reported to General Manager "Sine-Ze" Andrey Lebedev.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately he will not come under family circumstances.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized game because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will allow for the development of our young games," he said.
Remember: With the direct participation of Jetera, Ukraine's Assembly took the sixth place in Eurobosket 2013 and the first fires at the world's basketball champion, where "jelto-sin" could not go beyond the group stage, while the US bully picked up 15.4 glasses in the middle of the game, made 3 sets and delivered 5 transfers.
Jeter stopped speaking about Ukraine's collection from the position of Chief Trainer of our national American team, Mike Fratello, who left the post in 2015.
The 2017 Eurobasket will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will conduct its team tournament matches on the Promised Land.
The following five items will be included in the Group B: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our men's assembly conducted two control units with Dutch and Belarusians.
A great wave of trampa?
I think it's very reasonable to imagine Mita Romni.
In the Trampa era, the fact was that political disputes that polarized the U.S. power plant broke up into micro-familys.
Between the Day of Thanksgiving and the Birth of the United States, U.S. newspapers shot at the columns about how to deal with terrible family members voting for Trapa.
Looks like we're all so stressed out that we're gonna get hit.
They're less talking about the ability of Trapa to unite families.
I'm writing about this because my cousin, left-wing poetry from Chicago, who had long been with the Republicans in his family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity in the fight against the general enemy could have a powerful effect.
At Trampe in the White House, everyone she knew, including her brother-in-law, with whom she had argued over politics for decades, appeared suddenly and strangely on one side.
In fact, this is certainly good; but I can't think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Tramp inspired forces in the left wing, but the deformed effect of his rule can all of us move right.
When we talk about Trape and "normalization", we have a small chance that we will sometimes stop defeating its exits.
There is, however, a more questionable scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the most right-wing Republicans, which, on the basis of its standards, is an unexpected example of a healthy sense.
I realized that I am very sorry today for the old stupidity of Mitt Romni - with dogs on the back of the car and 14 per cent tax (but at least we knew what his tax declaration looked like) - compared to Trump and that, and the other seems to be very small.
When Tripp goes away, the next Republican candidate will simply be able to see a great step forward.
When my kitchen went to the center, we went with the children on a wheelchair in the Central Park -- the largest in the economy of the Department of Parks in New York and the best way in the city to spend three dollars if you don't need coffee.
The evils are huge and huge, glass paintings on the central drums - the criminal clowns and animals, who, in horror, look at themselves on the back, - are extremely violent, and the loud music, like no wonder, brings them into the back.
So many well - known objects in this city are disappointed: the species of skyscrapers are getting old, the buildings are too hard to challenge, and the reality of the city does not work out.
Thirty-five years ago, and I'm still alive on the day I learned that the Swiss-Cotted area is actually not Switzerland's cupboard (thematic pope Ye Old Swiss Cottage is not in account), but a large circuit crossing in North London.
And the carousel in the Central Park is still an unusual, wild place where two-year-olds, eleven-year-olds and two-year-olds can spend a great deal of time.
If I could put a chair down, I'd put a five, but, unfortunately, no one asked me about it.
And in the universe this week, I was asked to assess my "experiment" purchases on a scale from one to five stars.
In the coffee shop on my street, it's the same plus the option to follow a 15-per cent tea rating -- that's the order at the stop.
As a result, it is not only a slow process of neutral interaction, but it is still necessary to bring about a personal relationship in a situation that is not expected.
A poor salesman in the universe was baffled while I realized how much I had been able to give her a credit card in five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to the hospital for pain in the chest
Pistorius is leaving prison for a visit to the doctor's office the second time.
Last year he was transferred to a hospital for treatment of seizures that, according to the prison administration, resulted in a fall in the chamber.
Pistorius was convicted of an attempted murder after the prosecution appealed to the original sentence for an unintended murder.
He killed Steinkamp early on the morning of St. Valentine's Day in 2013, several times through the bathroom door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorios said he had taken his friend for the night door that he had locked in his toilet.
The prosecutor stated that he intended to give another protest, this time against the six-year term of Pretourius, which, she said, was too soft.
The General Prosecutor stated that the appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be considered this year.
Pretourius may be increased by 15 years if the procurator is successful.
South Africa has no death penalty.
A non-exit signature was selected for the TTV logger suspected of breaking up.
The Chief Lawyers chose a cut-off measure in the form of a men's visa for the attack on the NTV TV journalist Nikita Discharged during a direct ephemeral from the park of Gorky on 2 August.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the MDR RF Irina Volk.
“In the context of a criminal investigation carried out under section 116 of the U.S. R.F.R. (Poboi) concerning a 32-year-old man who was attacked by a television correspondent in the Central Culture Park and the rest of the name of Gorki who was suspected of having a restraining measure in the form of a non-exit and appropriate behaviour,” Volk explained.
The representative of the MDG added that an administrative protocol on police non-compliance had been drawn up with the suspect.
On Wednesday, 2 August, at the time of the direct EfHD Day, an emergency man came to the correspondent and hit the face.
As it turned out later, the Hulligan had nothing to do with VDV.
In fact, according to Dr. Dawzaeva, the dissidents, on the contrary, tried to keep the mosquish.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal court stand
As the Bi-Ti-Vi television was transmitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal court stand.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people were detained in a stateless place, including two Bulgarian citizens.
On that day they were let loose, while they were yet guided.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on the Bi-Ti-Vi TV, which was then released by Bulgarian citizens.
The Greek authorities have intensified control over the free campaign and have already imposed serious penalties on all those who are arrested while in a position not intended for this place.
Checks will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose fines.
Russia's MID accused U.S. Vice-President of the Cold War of rhetoric
Statements made during the US Vice-President Michael Pens' European tour have been criticised by the Russian IDA.
“It is sad to note that Washington is deeply concerned at the primitive ideologicalized prints of the Cold War, which are completely out of reality,” said the Russian Foreign Office.
So in the media, they responded to the words of Pensa on "the Russian threat" and attempts to cross the border they had been told in Podgorica.
The Russian MID pointed out the destabilization of the choice "with the West or with Russia" and the invisibility of any non-alternative entry of all South-East Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that the United States had violated international law by using force to expel Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another face of tension.
“We urge American colleagues to end Russia’s silhouette and its foreign policy line, which is constantly based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual interest,” says the Russian IDA.
Feldcher suffered in DTP with "fast" in the South Pacific.
The TTP occurred in the underground Stopino, resulting in a collision with the fast-paced help belt.
Today about 08:10 msk has been hit by a Mitsubishi car with a car emergency in the city of Stopino Moscow.
"As a result of the collision of the "fast" machine, TASS said in the Moscow-based GU MVD press service.
On the site of the TIR, law enforcement officers worked, and the circumstances of the case were clarified.
In the Odes area, a woman threw her newborn son into a cellophone package.
On the evening of 3 August, a report was received from the local police department that he had found a package in an unaccompanied private home with a youth.
"In place of the event, lawyers and doctors who had promptly delivered the child to a medical institution," they reported to the Head of the National Police.
The doctors determined that the boy had been born within hours of his discovery, as evidenced by the existence of a doll.
A 36-year-old local population has been established during primary operational and research activities.
It was also established that the woman had three other minor children.
As noted in the chapter, the family has not previously fallen into the field of law enforcement.
The circumstances and causes of this procedure have now been established by the police, which have led to a procedural decision.
A young man is now under the supervision of a doctor.
As reported earlier, a 21-year-old woman in Nicaragua threw her unborn child into a museum.
Grigory Leps: "I'm fighting, though 55-not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian era, Gregory Lemps, in the near future, has celebrated his 55th year.
Before the show, the singer was contacted by the news examiner.
I remember how your "pilent" was noticed.
The special chassis in the Slavonics, Gloria Genor was dressed for a name, a powerful sailor over the Moscow River.
You'd be surprised if you'd like to spend your next five years.
Did the idea come true?
It was a successful period when it was about the profession.
I worked very hard, three times going through all over the country, giving 120-130 concerts a year.
He released two bad albums.
Of course, I'm not what I said 20 years ago.
Biotimes don't lie.
The fifth time I've been drinking in my 30s, it's getting harder.
Still, I'm fighting, I don't want to stay.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going out on another level.
You're writing a new album with them for the first three years.
Yeah, it's working on him now.
Of course, we've already written everything in my study and now we're going to send it to Los Angeles.
It's called "What's so serious?" in a single song written with Timothy.
She's not ready yet, so we never showed her up.
We'll do it later when we take a picture of her.
And the album will be presented in November to the series of my jubilee concerts in Moscow's Cross City Hall.
Your new plastic has been hand-made by the classic American drummer Chris Coleman.
You think you wanted him and his personality to get involved?
In my view, the Colman is one of the world's most devoted drummers today.
He came to my studio, wrote his parties.
I invited him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects. "Esquisition ") proposed.
But to continue their work in Russia, they raised, in a mild manner, excessive conditions.
It's about donors from €35 000 to €45 000 per month.
Then I thought that I'd go to the post-Soviet area for worthy musicians.
And he found Max Malisheva's great drummer.
It's better to feed your own.
Sometimes I want to join any of them, not for anything.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly quoted at the international level.
He's written in Western music magazines and invited him to various guitar festivals.
Steve Way, listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists came with another executive technique."
Your album is in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you can't come to the United States yourself?
Are you trying to remove this ban?
Now, I'm honest, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers involved in this matter.
As a musician, I'm really sorry I can't go to America.
I didn't say I'd be there.
The more you interact with these professionals, the more useful.
We don't fuck them, but we don't have that experience, schools.
Before our performers of popular music for 70 years, the tasks that American musicians have always faced have not been fully met.
They were trying to achieve a maximum quality sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now why did Great Britain give me ten years' leave?
But I'm going to put the visa documents in the British Embassy every year so that I can be allowed to eat there again, and the most important thing is to work there.
The rest of Europe is very kind to me.
And in August you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a lawn, but an affair, right?
Yeah, there's a good sports room in Monte Carlo. I've been there once.
Now they're invited again, and as far as I know, all tickets to the concert are already sold.
Are you going to Randew Lyme Wykule, which starts on July 20th in Urmala?
She invited me, and I finally turned down.
Lyma is a remarkable song and a great woman who is able to give herself and a beautiful ear, and even a hat.
After the parties and the jubilee concerts, I know how much you want to talk to Vladimir the High.
You already have two albums with his songs on the discography.
When's the third time?
Probably next year.
But he'll be made a completely different one.
I want to write 80-90 high-level songs in the same data as he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
No other arrangement.
My company will be our famous musician, Timur Vedernik.
I'm trying to get involved in the album and Alexander Yakovlevic Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about it, we had a good relationship, but he's busy, so let's see how it works.
You and Bourissa Grebenchikov were gradually brought into your repertoire.
Maybe then you'll write his album?
Boris Boris Borisovic is a great man and a great musician.
Several times I would break up with him and ask him: ‘ Can I repeat some of his songs?
He said, "Grigory, I am writing songs so they can be fulfilled."
Please, try it, come on.
I'm sure it's interesting to record that album.
I still have no such task, but in the future, in two years, if Boris Boris Borisovic will not be able to oppose me, I may be making such a project.
If you don't have a full focus on your shopping center.
I guess until you realized his potential, didn't you sign contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of executives I'd like to have under my wing, but they're people of their own.
You mean Sergey Lazarev?
Serja is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I can't agree to anything with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he has his development strategy.
And now there's Alexander Panayots at my center, which I know in the "Volose".
We made a deal with him and we work with him.
In our pop music, such songs are rare.
If he does not reach the heights he is worthy of.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire. I'm taking the clips.
I'm hoping for a good outcome.
And I'm also trying to move the other artists of my center: I buy them songs, I'm crying poets, sometimes their tracks fall into the rotation of the bodies and the radicals.
If they don't get bigger, I'll still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
They'll get a record album on the way out, a couple of clicks.
And if they want, they can go their way, and I will not force them to return the money they have invested in them.
Although I would be pleased if one of them had a business success and paid me the interest we had agreed on in the contract.
But if this doesn't happen, I'm not going to get anyone to cover the oxygen.
Let them all work, they break, they prove how I ever proved.
If tomorrow you're offered a restaurant tour across Ukraine and you're guaranteed entry into the country, will you?
I'm still invited there.
It is primarily about closed activities.
What about the big hole...
I was a man of my country, a Russian, on my own conviction that I flew into Syria on the same plane that then broke up.
If they say tomorrow that they need to fly at some other point in the interests of the State, it's OK.
And I'm afraid that bloggers and other critics think about me.
I am very sorry that we had this situation with Ukraine.
Because I think we're one people and we're supposed to be together.
I'm sorry if that happens, at least in the near future.
And I used to spend 40 or 50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
They met like nowhere.
I'm very grateful to the public.
And with a number of Ukrainian artists, Ani Lorak, Saint Lobodo, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, there are many people who have been betrayed, and it is a true regret that they cannot now fully pay their talents to a large Russian audience.
Music has to unite and divide people.
I would be pleased to invite a certain class Ukrainian executive in Russia, such as Slav Vacarchuka, and to have a concert with him.
But I think at this point it's unlikely...
Andrey Ohlopkova was excavated with space
As was known as "E", East Andrey Ohlopkov, Technical Director of Space Space, began work at the State Space Research and Production Centre (GCNCP) named Hruniceva.
He had previously worked on the construction of the East Space, but because of differences with the management of the Centre for Land and Space Infrastructure (CENKI), he had been transferred to the Moscow Films, where the production coordination took place.
Mr. Okhlopkova will not be replaced by the technical director's post, which will soon be emptied and the staff will be broken down by CNCI units.
The fact that the Technical Director of the East and the Deputy Director of the CNCI on Technology Development, Andrey Ohlopkov, moved to the GCNPC on the name of Hruniceva, “O” told the top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as the staff of the Government’s staff.
"He's been working on a new post for several weeks," the partners explained in the industry.
It was not possible to get the CENCI's operational comment on Thursday, but Mr. Ohlopkov himself was not available for the comments.
However, the information "E" was officially confirmed in the CPC.
He decided to move to the Executive Director's Coordination post, - stated to the company. - Andrey Okhlopkov, assigned to him to ensure a minimum leave for the first launch in the Eastern Space.
Mr. Ohlopkov moved to work at CENKI in 2013, with a view to serving in space forces, in particular in Baykonur, and in Plesecke - in the "north" space space, he was the first deputy commander to serve as Colonel.
In 2009, Andrey Ohlopkov became a criminal figure.
He was charged with taking into account the fact that the regional traders had received orders from him but had not fulfilled their obligations to set up separate parts of the air carriers in the Algerian area and the Republic of the Commission.
In 2012, the court recognized him as innocent.
Its responsibilities for technological development were extended to various projects, but most of them became a space strike in the Middle East.
At that time, the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenco, directly stated that the situation in the East “was already critical in October 2013.
The case was that a strategic error was allowed in planning: the end of the strike and the launch of the first launch of the Soviet-2.1 carrier rocket was planned at the same time as the end of 2015.
In order to implement the strike by the end of the year, the end of the strike had been decided in advance and the deadline had been set from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, it was necessary to arrive at a speedy pace: CENCI specialists started carrying parallel installation of technology equipment on non-equipped facilities.
Andrey Ohlopkov was the main party to this idea.
Despite the existing risks and such transfers (instead of December 2015 the Alliance only flew on 28 April 2016), this idea justified itself, says the source of "E" in space: " Otherwise we would still not have carried out any East-Weapon but would have taken care of it."
Vice-President Dmitry Rogozin, who was curating spacecraft, called Andrew Ohlopkov his " spacecraft", but he almost always asked for information about the flow.
Mr. Ohlopkov recalled, for example, in his interview with Mr. E, he proposed that the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Specstroy) cancel the status of the sole executive on the East and work directly with subcontractors: "Why should we put all eggs in one corner of Specstro?"
This idea was supported by the Government.
Since 2017 CENCI has assumed the responsibility of the General contractor to complete construction work in the start-up and technical complex planned for the fourth quarter.
According to Mr. Ohlopkova ' s new place of work, there has been a disagreement with the CENCI leadership on how to complete the spacecraft and complexes and how to work with sub-regular organizations.
"It was decided that this would be best for all," said one of the top managers who participated in the East.
The staff member of the Government, in turn, calls for a strange solution: "He was one of the best specialists, finding him an equivalent replacement will not be easy."
According to the data "O", this is not required: the position of the Technical Director of Space will be eliminated and its functions will be broken down by the CNCI units.
There will be a two-special education programme in music schools
In the future, students of children’s music schools will be able to acquire two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Ministry of Science and Education of the Ministry of Science and Education of the Ministry of the University of Golubenko, it is possible to re-read the lessons learned over and over again, and the question of paying other special attention is to be resolved with the assistance of the special border, which is referred to as RIA News.
“The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue under control, and we are working with the expert community to develop a mechanism that will promote two specialities, but at the same time will not conflict with existing education legislation,” Golubenko said.
On the last Friday during the Nedetic Talk, Vladimira Putin, a student of the Children ' s Centre, Sirius, reported that it was necessary to pay for the second specialty in the SMS at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she was studying in the script and forpéopian class and had both courses.
The Head of State recognized her question very relevant and promised assistance.
In Mexico a 17-year-old Russian prisoner is detained on a wall on the roof
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russianman Kirill N., who is on the wall on the roof of the building, reports Portal El Universal.
The incident occurred in the capital of Mexico.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, moved through a three-metre camp in the territory of the Nestle office complex and took himself to one of his bosses.
However, he did not use any special care, insurance and trust.
They've already held a young man on the roof.
The Ministry of Public Security has landed him on the ground on a helicopter.
Thereafter he was sent to the National Institute for Migration.
It explains whether the youth is legally located in the territory of the country.
Meanwhile, a video with a young man coming up to the top became popular on the Web.
The users called the young man-to-law.
According to the media, such experiments are Hobbies for him.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate can help to ease the risk of HIV infection.
Red meat and chocolate are accepted as a cosmetic for your diet.
However, recent studies suggest that diet, rich in meat and milk products, can help alleviate the symptoms of those suffering from burnout.
This incurable disease, which affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in Britain, leads to life, chronic or blood loss, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually to alleviate symptoms, it is advisable to avoid meat and milk products, but researchers from the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid, the white triptophan, contributes to the production of immune cells that increase the fat tolerance.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells in the lung are monitored for not entering the immune cells.
Cells capable of starting the combustion process are equivalent to cells that increase tolerance, protect the body and do not harm sensitive tissues.
If the equation is too much in the direction of combustion, it can lead to inflammation of the lung.
Experiments have shown that mice with a specific bacteria in their hives have increased cell tolerance.
And this bacteria needs triptofan -- one of the building elements of the protein -- to start the development of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one kind of bacteria - Lactobacillus Reuters, which is part of the normal microbiotic fluid and the development of the population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more triptophans were fed into the meat, the more they had these immune cells."
He suggested that the same would be true of people: L. Reuters and rich tropical diets could contribute to a more tolerant and less sensitive environment in the kitchen.
Dr. Luisa Servantes-Barraganvas, after studying the diversity of immune tolerance cells, found that one group of mice had these cells and another group belonging to the same line but had not been identified separately.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the microbiotics of the mice - communities of bacteria, viruses and flu who normally live in the heat-circuit tract.
The DNA of the muscle cell was sequenced and six types of bacteria were detected in the muscle containing immune cells but not in the muscle.
Muscles grown in a sterile environment with no good microbromos and no such immune cells have L. reuters and immune cells have appeared.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers have developed L. reuters into the liquid environment and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells separated from the muscle.
Immune cells have become more tolerant cells.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it was the side product of triptophan processing known as Indul-3-moleic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptofans in meat, the number of cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the triptophan level was reduced twice, the number of cells fell twice.
Dr. Servantes-Barragan explains that people have the same increasing tolerance of cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their heat-cracking tract.
It is not known whether side products of triptophan from L. Reuters contribute to the development of cells in humans as well as in mice, but in people suffering from infectious lung diseases, there have been findings of genetic defects associated with tripitophan.
She says: "We may need to strengthen the development of these cells, as these cells depend on internal combustion processes.

According to Jose Maurinya, Manchester of the United States launched "genia" in the face of Nemani Matica
Manchester of the United States called "genia" in the face of Nemani Matica, says Jose Maurini after the semi-definition detachment against Sampdoria in the middle of the night.
The game acquired for 40 million pounds in Chelsea began with 2-1 in Dublin in the latest U.S. premier match before the WEFA match against Real Madrid on Thursday and was impressed by the role of the semi-defencer, while the games of Paul Pogbe and Andreas Pereira disappeared before they were defeated.
However, since Mattic did not participate in the Chelsea Presbyterian Tour in Asia, he did not receive training for the game, and he stayed for 45 minutes, which he said would require completion before the start of the premier season.
“He needs time, but his experience, mind, geniuses in how he thinks – he thinks football,” said Maureen.
"We'll help him get ready sooner than later."
Like Mattich, his new friends Victor Lindeloff and Romel Luka started the game at the Aviva stadium when Maurini began to form its main composition by the beginning of the following season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Maureen wanted to take three more games, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results and that three of the four games he wanted to take first.
"I am grateful to the club for having won three out of four," he added.
I am more eager if they reach me four, but they are too old for me."
Former leaders of the Lithuanian Social Democrats claim to remain in the ruling coalition
The former presidents of the Socialist-Democratic Party of Lithuania, former Prime Minister Algiridas Butkawičus and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former Speaker of the Social-Democratic Party Chesolas Jursanas, called on the parties to remain in the ruling coalition.
As the Parliamentary Journal reported, due to training with partners - the Christian Union and the Greens - a debate was launched in the Social Democratic Party on whether to remain in the right coalition.
There were also three senior experienced partners, with an open letter, saying: “The disappointment of the party's partner with the results of the elections, but the coalition with "Christians" has created for us a gap and not very easy, but the conditions for continuing to live for the purposes of social justice that are set out in the Government's programme and for maintaining the political domination of the left centre over the right parties”.
According to former party leaders, the discussion "has been based on emotion without specific arguments".
The authors fear that unexpected actions may lead to political, economic and social instability in Lithuania.
As told by Anton Momaev, a man with disabilities, was sentenced.
Mosgorsud has reduced the punishment of four- and-a-half years of imprisonment to 200 thousand rubs.
The former decision of the Timorese Court of Justice was released from SIZO.
By this time, Mosgorsud confirmed that the accused was a criminal because he had organized a car robbery and theft in an ex-expert fighter.
By his decision, Mosgorsud reduced Anton Mamaev's sentence to 200 thousand rubs.
"Mamaev is an organizer of a crime, which is also a form of crime, and, accordingly, such a person must be brought to criminal responsibility," explained "E" by Mosgorsud Secretary Ulyan Solopov.
In this case, the court had taken into account the state of Mamayev ' s health, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of urgent circumstances.
In addition, the court applied paragraph 64 of the CFR which provides for a lower limit of punishment.
With regard to Assistant Mamaeva Vasilia Serostanov, the court did not establish conditions that would serve as a basis for the change in the severity of the sentence and the change in the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that he remained dissatisfied with the Moscow decision.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legal solution would be justification aimed at further fighting for justice.
His lawyer, Andrey Orlov, did not exclude the appeal of the sentence in the Mosgorsud and the Supreme Court.
"We will make use of all the resources available to the European Court of Human Rights," he said "RIA News".
Remember, 28-year-old Anton Mamaev, who suffered from spinal muscle atrophy, became a criminal figure last year.
The disabled claims that he bought a motoraller in some 160 thousand rubs for sale.
However, motorists, among whom the former specialist combatants, claimed that disabled persons and their assistant Vasili Seroshanov had chosen their property and threatened to use violence.
On 30 June, the Regional Court of Moscow sentenced Vasilia Serostanov to three years ' colony, and Anton Mamayeva to four and a half years ' imprisonment in the general regime (see para. 2 p. 162 of the CFR).
After the forced disability was transferred to SIZO, the General Assembly, the Genocide, authorized by human rights, was convened by President Tatyana Moskalkov.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from SIZO by a decision of the same Timorese court.
Protection, in turn, appealed for the decision of the first instance in Moscow.
UNF will prepare a report on the environment to the President
The outcome of the "Forum of Action" of the People ' s Front (UNF) in 2017 will address the environmental issue, the "Explosives" source of UNF informed the UNF and confirmed the head of the mission of Alexei Anisimov ' s movement.
According to him, the Forum on Frontoviks plans to prepare a report of the President on the problems of rural environment and to propose a strategy for their resolution.
The UNIFEM Knowledge partners noted that the report of the Head of State would contain a “deep analysis” of the situation in all federal areas of the country.
According to the "Inquiry" data, the outcome forum of UNIFEM will be a drawback.
The exact date of its implementation has not yet been determined - usually under the timetable of the President, who is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present at the key activities of UNIFE.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one per two federal districts, in Rostov-na-Donu, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The outcome will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Burundi, Ulan-Udé.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be made for these activities, we and we are developing systematic proposals to address environmental problems, as described by the UNIFIL ' s “Effects” component.
The Co-Chairperson of the Centre for the Movement of Olga Timofeva, Head of the Committee on the Environment and Environmental Protection, reported that Frontovices would report to the Head of State on the work carried out within the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The outcome environmental forum and the UNFO will soon be reassessed.
Over the year, we have raised a strong team of environmental experts, seen gaps in legislation, and stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be included in the report that we prepare for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, Frontwicks are also reporting on the work on priority projects of UNF, as reported by Olga Timothy.
She said that the Forum would also be invited by the Special Representative of the Head of State on Environment, Environment and Transport of Sergei Ivanov.
He had previously participated in the UNF Mediaforum, which passed to St. Petersburg in April.
Within a few months, the Year of Ecology will go back to history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they can work for years.
In order to avoid such issues from the agenda, Olga Timothy added.
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Institute of Social Research (ESI) and Andrey Kolyadin noted that the environmental issue was being addressed by UNF as the presidential agenda.
Many things they as experts have offered to various forums, and these initiatives have received the support of the President, Andrey Kolyadin said.
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded today, which could give regions an additional impetus for development.
The UNF region will continue to be able to address not only its environmental problems but also the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The issue of environmental issues has demonstrated a "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President had asked questions about the oil spill in Balashachia (closed) and about the coal dust at the port of the city of Nahoka (the draft law on the prohibition of open coal spills in human settlements, one of the authors of Olig Timofeva).
Environmental experts believe that the legal basis for addressing environmental problems in Russia has been established in general, the issue is in further legal practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
A clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State is considered by Leonid Bochin, head of the Ecology Fund for All.
A member of the SPC, Head of the Non-Governmental Organization of the Russian Grympis, Sergey Casplerov, in his discussion with the Emissions, stressed that a responsible approach to environmental problems is needed for society and business, a few legislative efforts.
As society and businesses only realize that environmental problems are a much more useful step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, stated Sergei Casplenkov.
The expert stressed that it was necessary to break the trend that environmental legislation violation was an economical solution for business.
The British inventor used his microchip to fall into the house and machine by hand
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip so that he could open the door to his home, enter the office, and even install a car with a simple hand grabbing.
Thirteen-year-old Stephen Northam has been using a cross-sectional chip between large and pointed fingers and now, through his BioTek company, offers this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives by technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist from the Royal University of Winchester, in order to ensure that the treatment procedure is conducted in accordance with medical standards.
Technology is like a microchip that uses bones and dogs, and the procedure takes 30 seconds.
Nortami also replaces lockers in houses and cars with a pair of chips at 300 pounds for one lock.
The father of one child has already established technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which takes place when his hand is on the wheel.
The bill for the White House has been paid to taxpayers in thousands of dollars
According to the records of the armed forces provided by the TIME magazine, the decision of the White House last month to hold a seabed helicopter on the South Ouija board for an activity involving American industrial production amounted to $24,000.
The White-Green Sikersky VH-3D, known as Marine One, was the central element of the event held on 17 July in the White House, where American construction programmes were demonstrated.
President Donald Trapp, Vice-President Mike Pens and the senior officials of the White House were looking at technological products from all fifty states.
The helicopter in Connecticut was presented by a train from Man, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a busloader from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Maritime Corps helicopters (HMX-1), the Department responsible for the management of the helicopter, the White House Military Administration was scheduled to attend the helicopter in private order, or FRAGO, 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Pole in case of “unusual” activity.
“I just wanted you to make sure that you were in the course, because this is an unusual wide-ranging press event,” wrote Commander HMX-1 in an e-mail to his boss, the first Deputy Chief of the Marine Corps Air Force, who ordered the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Pole at about 7 o'clock on the morning of 17 July to participate in the 3 o'clock event and will remain there until the zone is released between 6 and 9 o'clock on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, second training will be required for the return area in accordance with the working time limits.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the operation and the unit security personnel remained in line with the aircraft while it was on the ground.
The records received by the TIME magazine left no clear indication as to whether it was needed as a result of the second crew.
The Hetcha Act prohibits federal officials from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 explained whether the activity of this provision would be contrary.
“In part, we asked whether this was a violation of Hetch's law, and we replied that it was not,” wrote the commander.
"It seems you're going nowhere," said the Deputy Chief.
The “America” event was announced in the White House as an official event, and the Hetcha law did not extend to it.
But even official activities have political notes.
In the course of the event, the President made efforts to promote the health reform that was then being developed in the Senate and commended efforts to regulate government decisions.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is almost new.
The Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But to ask them only for photo-opportunity is unusual.
Tramp was already the subject of discussions in February when the presidential plane was on the back during his first pre-election trip to Melbourne, Florida, and his account on Twitter was filed with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
“The White House in the Second “America” exhibition presented products from 50 countries made by American workers from American materials”, said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House of Lindsey Walters.
HMX-1 teams often perform training fields around the Washington Aglomery and the South Pole to ensure that the United States President is transported directly to the White House.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training assignments in the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight carried out for the “America” activity was calculated in the light of the required training courses per month.
The Unit ' s helicopters also took 11 additional hours on that day under the “non-presidential support tasks”.
According to the White House, the taxpayers were not paid for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
The representative of Sikorsky reported that the company did not participate in the show at the South Ouija board.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget in the presidential fields and it is difficult to determine the exact amount of the event.
However, according to the time-limit of the Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017, the rate of reimbursement of the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight.
The section records indicate that the flight time in the air was 30 minutes per side with its aircraft base base at the Kuantiko Marine Base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real value of using the laptop is much lower than that rate.
“The calculation of the value of taxpayers based on an exemplary rate of refund is entirely wrong,” says Walters.
“These rates include personal composition, service and many other non-recoverable costs included in annual allocations”.
According to a study carried out by the REND Corporation in 2015, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of the personal composition, but they actually take into account the cost of the fuel, services and costs set out in the contract.
At the time, the former press secretary of the White House, Sean Spaser, spoke for the protection of the use of a helicopter for activities.
“The idea of showing the things that have been done in America this week,” said Spiser.
“And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to national security, and that there are, I guess, hundreds of people, if not thousands of people, whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and another war technique that has been constantly working on so many Americans.
It is therefore absolutely appropriate to draw this attention.”
It was unclear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter, looking at the South Pole at the time of the event, but he owned the driver's seat in a fire car.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky's representatives with a press on the subject of its own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky well," said the President. "I have three of them."
Moscow will allocate funds for city hospitals' rehabilitation offices
Each year, the Life Savings Grants will be awarded to the head clinics' intensive treatment teams and clinics.
The means are to encourage doctors and medical sisters.

They are intended for relatively small operations.
The process of surgical intervention uses advanced medical equipment to significantly reduce patient recovery time.
After the operation at the station, they've been doing everything for a few hours.
Only in the first half of the year, at the clinic, the name of the patient was provided with stationed assistance to 36,000 patients.
Medical staff performed 15800 different complexities.

Electricity is also available for residents, and for Buryat goods producers
More than a decade of efforts by the Soviet and postal authorities of the Republic of Burundi (East Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
From 1 September 25 per cent of electricity is reduced to low pressure for industrial recipients.
The Federal Anti-Fraud Service of the State in accordance with the RF Government Regulation “To amend the Common Energy and Power Market Regulation and the combined forecasting balance of production and supply of electricity (power) within the framework of the Russian Energy System for the Russian Federation Subjects” (from 17.07.2017, No. 842) established an indicative price for electricity and power for industrial users of the Republic of Burundi.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Burit commodity producers is reduced to four times as much as it would make life easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and individual enterprises.
For many decades, the leaders of the Republic have been fighting against Moscow's cabinets in trying to balance the region's tariffs with the nearby Irkutsk area with the cascade hydroelectric power station in Angar, which runs from Baikal, the main waterfront territory for which Buryat is located.
And it was only this year that the movement began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population were reduced from 4.24 rubs/kWtch to 3.93 rub/kWtch, or 7.3%.
With the exception of the Government of the Federal Government in the List of Common Market Price Areas, which sets out the specific features of the functioning of the common and different markets among industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this was only the beginning because the Iraqi population paid $1.11 per hour.
However, no one is entitled to call even if the date of the new tariff movement is nearing the end of the decline in Burundi.

National Association of Unqualified, Municipal and Cotton Workers (GMB) Concerned about the capitalization of McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The trade union requires guarantees from the managers of McVitie's Bishket for its long-term obligation to manufacture factory in Glasgow.
The Scotland branch of GMB reports that the company has been hiding the issue of future investments on an interpretative facility.
There are more than 500 people working at Hobnobs and Rich Tea, among other products.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, reports that over the past few years it has invested more than 5 million pounds.
The company adds that in the event of any changes in the work of staff members and trade union representatives, they “know them first”.
In a letter to the manager of the company-owned facility, the Scotland branch of GMB needed McVitie's response to concern that funding would not be allowed to modernise production lines.
"The members of our trade union are deeply concerned that we cannot get information from the Director-General of the Business and Investment Plan on the future of Tolcross."
Families worked here for generations, and the concentration of large labour in local society and in the territory of the Great Lakes; this is the most important pillar of decent work in the field of high unemployment and social exclusion.
Thus, from the point of view of jobs, wages and promotions, and in the background of Bretzita, the growth of the livelihood and the chronic decline of production, East And Glazgo is suddenly needed in the production of McVitie's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “The head of the interpretation facility only received a letter from the Scotland GMB yesterday, and the company will respond immediately as we appreciate our continued cooperation with the staff and representatives of the trade union”.
Two months ago we held a regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tolcrosse, where we discussed a number of issues openly.
We talked to staff about that as all companies working under the conditions of the maximum competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions - and this is about all our facilities and activities - to remain competitive.
“In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our interpretative facility, especially in productive lines and improving functional indicators”.
We fully appreciate the value of Tolcrosa as a productive facility, and in the event of any changes in its work, staff and trade union representatives will know about it first.”
Putin stated that the authorities would not give guidance to Rosnefti and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of gas supplies to the East Petroleum Company (WNHC) should be linked to Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but no one would give the "Gaspromo" as well as "Rosnefti".
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igorya Secin's request to assist in resolving the opposition.
The Head of State drew attention to the fact that the relationship between "Rosefty" and "Gaspromo" should be resolved solely on the basis of market principles.
The former head of "Rosnefti" Igor Sechin at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Middle East Federal District said that there was no agreement with "Gaspromo" on gas for WNHC.
Secin noted that the dialogue with "Gaspromo" on this issue continued.
"Gasprom" offers to find gas resources from the Rosnefti perimeter, but we don't have such resources," Sechin added.
Recall that Rosneft asked her to allow her to use the gas from the Gasproma gas from the East Petroleum Company, located in the Sahalin Shelf.
In June, Gazprom stated that the negotiations on this issue were continuing and that there was “no sharp angles”.

The sensory offer was restored by a colder transfer window when League 1 was ready to win a world record of the value of the transition more than twice as much as the previous note of Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United States last season over 89 million pounds.
When the transition is over, Niger will become the most expensive game in the world, as well as the most highly paid professional sportsman in the world, as well as the PSC offers over 500,000 pounds a week of net pay.
It is known that Barcelona and the popularity of the proposal and how Nimar broke the contract, despite the fact that the source, who is close to the head of the Catholic club, has always done everything possible to play since its transition from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world a warning of this three years ago by the President of the PSD?
When Manchester Siti expressed interest in taking Blesa Matthewid in 2014, Nasser Al-Helyafi gave a severe warning to any club that would want to change one of the best games of the PSP.
"I am not concerned because they know that if they attack one of our games, we will attack them and we will make a suggestion to their games," said Al-Halifi.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our games, they will have consequences."
In general, Barcelona crossed this picture when the Spanish club earlier this year expressed its interest in the PSD semi-protectionist Mark Verarti.
The PSC understood that it would not allow the Italian game to be held under any circumstances, and now it is likely that Barcelona feels the consequences of its proposal for the loss of one of its most valuable games, Niamara.
