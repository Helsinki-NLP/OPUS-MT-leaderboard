Welsh AMs are concerned about 'Looking like Simplicity'
Some AMs suggest that their title should be changed to MWPs
This is the name of the Assembly due to plans to change the Welsh Parliament
Ams of the political spectrum are concerned that this may call the cause.
A lab AM said that their group is worried, it's "Twp and Pwp sings with Twp and Pwp
Out of range for external readers: twp in Welsh means dawt and pwp means poo.
An AM play said the entire group was "not happy" and suggested the change.
A Welsh Konzervetiv said their group was "open Mind" about the change in their name, but it noted that they had a little talk for MWP from Muppet.
In this context, Welsh letters dblüu are similar to the Uu of Yorkshire English
The Assembly Commission, which is preparing a draft law for a change of name in use, said: "The members of the Governing Body are called upon to make a final decision on the matter of their members."
The government's Welsh Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public opinion and the results of a public press conference, in which it received extensive support to call the World Health Organization.
In the case of the title of AMs, the Commission supported the Welsh Parliamentary Member or Double M.M.P.P.P.P., but the MWP development was the most supported in the country.
AMs are clearly recommending alternative options, but the conflict management officer may find it difficult to get agreement, Elin Jones, who expects the draft law to change within weeks.
The Law of Amendments will include other changes in the way Assembly work is carried out, including the design and rules of the AEM disabled and the committee management
When they pass the law, they will get this question and the final vote what they should be told.

Major statesman George Ivanov of Macedonia has told the opposition from birth that they will ignore the vote on the basis of a change of name.
Despite the fact that the birth certificate, along with Major General George Zeev, gives evidence that the change in name is worth all the effort to be included in the European and NATO

They said that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings where they were surrounded by people who did not help the rest of the neighbors

"We have changed our beauty vision and experience in order to increase access to our witnesses," said Paul Milz-Hakis, a salesman from Sansbury.
We've been particularly involved in the trained co-workers who will be ready to give advice.
The range of our brand is prepared to meet every need and the appropriate climate and self-sustainment facilities means that we are now in a beautiful beauty complex that gives us the old way of shopping.

Following comments from various parts of the U.S. government, the U.S.
In the meantime, China has presented its plan last year: this target will be number 1 in the A.I. innovation by 2030.

Macedonians vote in birth whether or not the country's name should be changed.
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a national assembly called "North Macedonia Statistics", which was a step towards resolving the old debate with Greece for decades, which prevented their membership speech for the European Union and Nato.
Greece has a bridge called Macedonia, the name of its northern neighboring country forms a bridge over its area and covers the gap between Nato and the European Union.
The two governments had agreed on the basis of a new name in June, but the anti-government opposition said that, in turn, there would be a lack of racial recognition of the moral prosperity of Macedonia.
President Gjever Ivanov says he has not won a vote among the people and Bicat has raised doubts as to whether this measure will meet at least 50 percent of the population.
The question of birth is, "Are you for NATO and the European Union's membership, in agreement with Greece?"
The Chief Minister Zoran Zvei, in addition to the fact that the name has been changed, gives convincing evidence that one of the countries that are from Yugoslavia's wife is required to be cautiously involved in such organizations as the U.S. and NATO for Macedonia.
Olivera Georgievska said, 79 years old, in Skopje: "I have come to vote for the future of the country today, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can freely remain under the European Union's borders, because this means safety for all of us."
Although not legally binding, many members of the community have said that they will obey the vote to make a decision

Gjos Tnivsky, 62 years old, said a poet in the Royal Skopje."I've come to get a vote for my children in Europe.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, his wife, Zorika, and their daughter, Doko, gave birth to their birth to change the name of the country in Macedonia, which will open the way for the entry into Macedonia on September 30, 2018, into the NATO and European Union.
In front of the university in Skopje, 54 - year - old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage, and he was attending the first - class Tamboo courses set up by birth control.
Kwadarkov said, "We are for Nato and U.S., but we want to get up and join our head, not through the door of the service.
"We are a poor country, but we have the right.
If they don't want us to be Macedonians, we can turn to other people like China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asian unity."
According to Professor Zeev, Nato’s membership will bring Macedonia to a very important conclusion, with an unprecedented rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think the majority will be on the side because our 80 percent of European citizens are on the side of the Union and Nato," Zev said after his marriage.
He said "yes" would be "the end of our future."
A survey published by the Macedonia Institute for Police Research on Friday said 30 and 43 percent of citizens will participate in the public – less than the required polling.
According to another survey conducted by Telema TV in Macedonia, 57% of the population are planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said, yes, they would.
A vote must be greater than 50 percent in order to be successful.
The birth failure represents the first serious face of the Western government's rule, since it was saved in May last year.

Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Liberian party should encourage the culture of tolerance.

In the last two years, I've been given a lot of advice that I should not talk anymore and then I'll be fine.
But I'm not what I'm here to do.
Since I had been associated with a school student 32 years ago, Theacher had been ostracized by the government, who had actually dropped my high school class down, I had asked the local councillor or government minister for the best social services they needed most.
I've never hidden my politics with the previous elections.
No one in Nottinghom in the East could have been talking about any kind of disagreement with my rule and the current leadership.
I would like to say to those who have given credit to me, that when the country is expanding to Bricht with which families, businesses and our services will be damaged, I don't want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Liber Party.
But I don't really have any message for the noting point, it's for me whether or not the library is a member of your service, and I promise that no threat of any kind of public or political interference will come from my work which I think is the best for all of you.

A.V.R. 38 - 17 Melros: Go to Nabad A.V.A.
Two-time attempts can be made to reduce the final results, but there is no doubt that A.V.A.R. should win the top priority game of this beautiful entertainment team.
They are now the teachers of the list, only one of the ten.
Finally, it was his best protection, as far as it was possible to get a better chance, which led the household team and gave him the full authority to continue to enjoy the rich Peter March.
"We've tried this game so far and we're still opposed, so I'll be happy," he said.
Robin Cristy of Melros said, "A.V.R. Credited, they took better chances than us."
The 14-minute effort of Grant Anderson was replaced by the Fresier Climo, A.V.A. Air was supported, although the Scotland Cap Rory Houses was released by the Yellow Card for play, Melros was allowed to give numbers, and Jason Baggot attempted an unexpected attempt.
Climo grew up with A.V.A.R. Lied, first, in half, he scored and then tried to make A.V.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.R. 17-5.
But Melros started out well in the second half and Patrick Anderson tried, changed by the bug, and Levi reduced to five.
Then, because of the serious deterioration of the nose, it was stopped for a long time, which was removed, and after re-starting, the A.V.A. Stafford McDowell's history was further advanced by the events that Climo had changed.
During the operation of the A.V.A. Captain Blair Macpson created a blue card, and again Melrose encouraged Bruce Colvin to try to replace him at the end of the heavy pressure.
Although the Homelu team came back and when the Stone Hachson was given the license card to pick up the money from the panel line, McFressen hid the letter from A.W.A.A.R.
Klimo changed, as he had begun again, after gathering David Armstrong's box box, and sent the flanger Gregor Henry for the fifth round of the house.

'The sea is ours': Bolivia is hoping to open the way for a fair haven of peace.
Malaha flew into a riverbed of La Paz.
Public buildings point to a huge blue wall.
From Titicaca to Amazon, the sea sites were described as matto: "We are officially the sea.
It's an act to get it back."
Bolivia, the perfect port, is still clear in a 19th-century civil conflict - as if it was about to resurface in the Pacific Ocean once more.
Perhaps they are the highest in the decades, such as whether Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of thought.
"In Bolivia there is a sense of love, unity and patience, and hopes for a cooperative solution," said a Bolivian politician, Roberto Klajidila.
A great deal of national concern and many Bolivian I.C.J. will see the decision, it is hoped that the court will be on the side of Bolivia's claims in the process because Chile is forced to talk to Bolivia in order to monitor the smooth sea.
Ivo Morels, the Christian statesman of Bolivia, who is enduring a civil war for the next year, is still very proud of the Saturday decision.
At the end of August, he swore, "We are very close to the sea of peace and return."
Some scholars believe, however, that it is unlikely that the Court would decide in favor of Bolivia’s rights, and if so, it will change.
The United Nations Organization in the Netherlands has no power to provide the Chilean field, and it has confirmed that it will not be determined as a result of the possible situation.
A Chinese lawyer at the International Law said Page Zarate said that the latest evidence indicated that the case "was not Jitil" was coming six months after the decision of the U.S.J.
And since further increase in Bolivia's causes, perhaps it has been resettled for the past four years.
Zarate said, "The use of Bolivian administration has raised the sea level of maritime contact."
Marlaus's best friend, Janjaru Benbazi, has separated himself from any of the innocent Chileans.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk for a while, but then it will be very difficult to think.
Since 1962, two countries have not changed.
Eduardo Rodríguez, former representative of Bolivia, in Hegh, commented that the court's decision was very urgent.
On Saturday, Bolivia will have a unique opportunity to open a new era of Chile's relations and "the end of a 139-year agreement with mutual benefit".
Caljadila also denied that Morales - Latin America is still one of the highest states -- which was using the sea issue as a political point.
He said, "Bolivia will never leave her right to reach the Pacific Ocean."
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to go out from time to time."
North Korea says that as long as it can trust U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Riyong says they will never destroy their country for the first time. If they can't trust Washington.
Riynywar was talking at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to comply with the commitments made by the opposing governments during an agreement in Singapore.

John Edward: The ability to speak languages is essential for the world’s citizens
There is a record of academic excellence in Scotland's self-reliance schools, and this remains with another set of test results, which is strengthened by personal and collective success in only games, art, music and other related events.
These schools, represented by the Scotland Council of Independent Schools (AsIAS), are trying to provide their students and parents with the best services available to over 30,000 students in Scotland.
The aim of self-restraint schools is to teach their students a degree and higher education, to choose a career and prepare them as a citizen of the world.
A field of learning that can design and apply the Bispok school text, we are seeing modern languages in schools as a popular and needed subject
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, he goes into his mind.
If you speak with him in his own language, he comes into his mind.
It's an impressive letter that when we want to contact and trust people from other countries, we can't trust English only.
We can see from the recent trial of this year that languages are at the top level of the log table in self-reliance schools.
The total of 68 percent of teachers had read foreign languages and obtained a high grade.
A combined data from 74 SCIS schools shows that 72 percent of the students obtained high grades in Mederin, while 72 percent of the graduates are also reading German, 69 percent are reading French, and 63 percent are learning Spanish.
This proves that there is support for foreign languages especially in volunteer schools in Scotland, which will be necessary for children and young people, without any doubt.
Currently, in the form of a theme selection, STEM themes (Scientific, Technical, Engineering, and Statistics) are being interpreted as self-contained school texts and anything else.
In 2014, a survey conducted by the U.S. D.A. Commission on Journalism and Prostitution found that there is a lack of language in 17 percent of the reason for the struggle against unemployment by day care.
So young people are becoming more and more needed to prepare for their future.
In a developing world, there is a need for languages for more potential workers, which are currently needed.
If any man's work has been chosen, he will receive a reward from God, because it has been given him; and he will receive him into his own house, and he will receive him into his kingdom.
As a result of the ability to communicate directly with people of other countries, a wide range of people will be kept in their own hands.
According to a survey of over 4,000 Yuca children in 2013, 75 percent of young people were unable to speak a foreign language fluently in order to continue their conversation, and French is the only language spoken by 15 percent.
That's why it's important to spend money to teach today's children language.
Many languages, especially those developed by means of financial regulations, will be prepared with a good opportunity to bring up children with a good sense of responsibility.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in its own language.
In many schools, more classical languages will be focused on modern languages, when other languages that will be available by 2020 will be taught the most important languages, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be many languages to choose from in specialized schools, including teaching staff who are skilled in this field.
Skatish volunteers are dedicated to providing the environment for learning in schools that will prepare the children and give them the skills they need to succeed, whatever will be in the future.
This cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, it is very important for a language country, and Eli must represent this teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "International Transport Honor".
The young people in Scotland will continue to offer choices, diversity and honor.

Libron James has almost lost his expectations of seeing the Las Angeles Lakes as the first start.
The lecturer's coach Luke Walton announced that James San Diego will play in the Pre-Sigon Opener on the first half of the first week of his career.
But for how many minutes will it be played?

But the reporter Mike Trudile tweeted that James will play for minutes.
After studying at the end of this week, James was asked about his "six-game news" programs for doctors.

Rider Cup 2018: A team increasing to Single yesterday showed hope for the battle to survive
After the three-page session, Thursday afternoon will be a group of four people needed for this Ryder Cup.
The puzzle in progress is a puzzle with a full idea of what the game is about, but you don't have any problems with what the player really believes, and you never have more than that.
So where is the speed to which they are going now?
Jordan Spieth walked quietly for the day, saying, "I'm tired, they have six-digit lead and now it's four, so we're moving forward as little as possible."
Europe is free to grow with more than 12 numbers in the game.
As Spithi says, Americans feel that while they have a lot of excitement and encouragement in their game, Spit and Justin Thomas are not less like each of them than they have received three numbers from four and play all day together.
Spieth's eye has affected you to the earth, and has advanced as an example.
As she was running during her journey, she quickly ran out of the window, and to get four classes of the match, when she and Thomas both came down twice, an important (Golf) Mari Günd was dug.
Goldie (Golf) Mari Gand, who won them the game at the top of the game, had only one shot, as she thinks the American team doesn't believe in it.
Spieth said, "You really need to get a bus deep and remember your game."
Each of these games has left all of this behind.
A flag to enable board numbering.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players who have more numbers than Spieth and Thomas, the Ryder Cup argued.
Europe's usual but loving couples are four of the four, and they can't make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was a single couple who didn't kill a bogey on Saturday morning, but on Friday morning they were taking it from the bogeys and went back on Friday morning nine.
This race and how the energy of both of them is influenced by this developed middle group that they are players that stop gambling, and the Flywoods Molinary you can't be any more popular players who can stop encouraging Europeans from winning as the sun sank over Le Golf National.
In particular, the two are in different ways at the same time.
However, the story of the European Gorve is well - known.
When he was married to Alex Norren, Booth Watson and Web Simson worked on a small project of four mornings in the Sergio García.
A bogey and two doodles bought Spanish and the Swedish Samn No.
Even though, Sunday, no one's gonna help you out of your hall.
The four players and the four known close friends are very pleased to see the effect of the couple's thinking on them, they have given them advice, they have not given them, and how a rule can change at the same time.
Europe has increased in the form of a team, and in the past and the last day it has won the lead, but this four - part session has also shown that the team is struggling to fight with the United States, especially the stadium, in doubt.
Europe's last day of Ryder Cup is for the leader of the 9th-century
The last day of Europe's Ryder Cup. On America, it will benefit by winning four and four-week Saturdays with the lead of the U.S.
The inspired couple of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have been meeting with two rival Tiger Woods and Le Golf National with four figures so far.
Two years ago, Thomas Bjorn of the European team called on Hazeltine to keep the busy truck on board, which drove the American team at four o'clock in the morning.
The United States faced more opposition than four, two matches won, but they didn't eat much.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight numbers in order to keep the truck on Saturday.
In Ryder Cup's history, Fleetwood is the first European to get four numbers in a row when he and Molinari, who were called "Mollwood" a week after the accident, were only four of the first four games to win.
After crossing Woods and Patrick Reed into the four gardens, he was able to warm up the Woods and American Ruki Bryson Dechambeau, with a great deal of warmth.
Woods, who had taken himself into two games on Saturdays, once accumulated the representation but now he's four games and four of them have been lost in twenty-eight games and seven were in one row.
Justin Rose, retired for the fourth round of the morning, returned with his four-year-old friend Henrik Stenson, brought Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka from the sixth and the sixth – the first number and the third in the world.
It was a pleasant and sunny day in the south-west of Paris in its own way, although Europe did not have it.
On Saturday, three-time winners, Jordan Spyth and Justin Thomas set up two benchmarks for the Americans.
They won a great victory with a great quintuple in John Raham and Len Polter and four games in Spain, and then the beginning broke two pillars and destroyed the polter and Rory McClorie by destroying them.
Only two times in the history of the radar cover has one team returned from a four-digit band, while Furyk's team needs the same balance to keep only a traffic barrier.
The second most important two days later, though, the attack will seem to be a long way off.
North Korea says 'No way' will be fired as a weapon without trust
A North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations Saturday that the bans had made their independence even more difficult in the United States and that in such a situation there was no way to leave unarmed weapons to the country.
Rího Young told the World's annual meeting that last year North Korea had been offering "a great deal of feedback" such as a certificate and a missile test and a stop, an end to a valid site, and a non-examination of conventional weapons and authentication techniques.
He said, "Because we don't see a full answer from America."
"There will be no confidence in our national security without any confidence in America, and there will be no other way we can get together with our own weapons without them."
When Rey raised the choice of anti-Washington's anti-Semitism against North Korea, that North Korea could be privileged, which had taken the necessary steps, such words became important, as Puning has done in the past, it refused to do so twice.
In June, Rey mentioned a shared statement followed by Kim Yong On and Donald Tramp, a teacher conference and a serviced U.S. Prime Minister and leader of a North Korean government in Singapore, when Kim insisted on working "Korean Dawp and Certification Stop" while the trumpet promised North Korea security.
North Korea wanted the end of the Korean War, but the United States said that Pyong should first leave his weapons.
Washington has also opposed the call to peace with the strong international barriers in North Korea.
Rey says, "U.S." insists on certification-first," and has allowed pressure to increase and achieve its goal strongly, and "he has also challenged the declaration of the end of the war."
"It's understood that the obstacles we can overcome which are unknown to us are a pipe fear of those people.
But it's hard to say that the continued restrictions are deepening our faith."
Rey did not mention the news of the second lecture of the conference between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. Secretary of State had given to the United States at the beginning of the week.
In the last five months, the mayor of Kim and South Korea discussed three meetings in Jain and said, "If this issue of Credentials and South Korea was part of this issue and not America, then the Korean island and the Credentials don't come so fast."
When he told the United Nations, however, the success of the Rei speech was much different in a way different from last year's, and the general meeting with North Korea's rocket was to say "Rocket Men" on a self-defense mission to the US Special Earth.
In the United Nations this year, the trumpet, which threatened to "completely defeat" the North Koreans last year, was commended by Kim for his courageous action, but he said that there was still much work to do and that the bans had to be maintained until North Korea's certification.
The trumpet told the wise man that there was no time for it, "If two years, three or five months start -- there's no difference."
China and Russia have given evidence in the Union that they want to take action and respect the held meeting for piling.
While, the U.S. state agency of Pompey said to the U.S.A., the Security Council said: "The ability and failure to apply the consent of the Security Council should be impossible until we fully understand the final, certified certification mark."
In 2006, the Security Council, acting as a member of the North Korean Air Force, contributed funds to the project's approval and abuse of Phuang in a speech that aired the embargo on North Korea
Pompey's United Nations office met Ryan-Poth and Rei.
Three times this year, Pompey warned North Korea, but the last one was not correct.
In July he left Punyang saying that he had been promoted, for North Korea only in hours, because he had been charged with "the demands of cattle".
North Korea promised to end a missile site and a fair building group in meeting this month with the moon if America "acts in the right way."
He said Kim told them that he was hoping for "informal action" that the storm in Singapore called for a security period and increased to create a common relationship with Washington.
Harvard students go to great lengths to get some rest
This year a new course in Harvard University has been gained to meet the growing macho culture of the Kaffin-in-Caffinian 'Water All Night' culture in order to get all its Andergrieguets to sleep completely through a voice.
The number of students at the school meeting is often ignored by a university when things are as necessary as they are to take care of themselves.
Charles Syssler Harvard Medical School, a professor of sleep drugs and Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared a course that he believes is the first course in the United States.
After talking about the different effects of sleep on learning, he urged the course to start.
'That's the end of the day, and a girl came to me and said, 'In my year of junior, why has this been told me?'
He told the Telegraph, he said he never told him the importance of sleep -- which surprised me.
This year's first course shows students that well-educated sleep improves with academic and athletic workers in their general environment.
Paul Barreira, professor of mental health at Harvard Medical School and director of health services at the University said that the university had been seriously asleep during the week during the school's decision to start the course.
Includes your work with the number of hours you've spent in the course of a conversation.
On the one hand, there is a picture of a living room where students click on coffee cups, glasses, coaches and books where the effects of caffeine and light and sleep and the effects of fast and fast routine are indicated.
On the other hand, it is reported that because of long - term sleepiness, the heart rate of heart failure, strokes, cancers, and cancers can increase.
Then the participants are encouraged to think of a map of their daily routine with an interactive icon.
‘ We know that this student's attitude will never change.
Professor Ceciller said, but we believe they have the right to know -- like you have the right to choose to drink cigarettes and know about the effects of health and nutrition.'
Modern technicians and students have a growing pressure on sleep, they say, the beauty of culture still 'keep on the watch'.
He must have been a "secret weapon" of a student in order to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, also suggesting that they also want to stop weight loss, such as having a white blood cell in a fragile mode, which keeps them permanently dry.
Remand Soo, a 19-year-old author and professor of physical life in California, who helped prepare Professor Czeisler's course, was in Harvard for the last year of his first year's first grade.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to encourage him to pursue the Campus course.
In the next reading, she hopes that all of these postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study program before they are included in the contest.
Dr. CSYSILER has suggested that students should set up alarms for sleep and wake up, and that there may be problems with coming out of the harmful effects of the 'Blue Light' by electronic alerts and LEDs.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rezers: Menga Gol Gerrard's man
The Rangers had another long-lasting turn of the day of the contest, as Dolly Menga's strategy had established Steven Gerard to destroy the 9th in Livingstone.
The Ibrox's team was trying to compete with St. Johnstone and his first winner on the road, but Gary Holt's team blocked Gerard's second defeat in the games because he left eight figures as manager and broke the hearts of the Ladbrokes Premiership leaders.
Menga has been stranded seven minutes ago and never felt the same in the ranks of Rangers.
When Rangers has now disappeared from six locations, Livingston goes up to three and only the lower end of the Hibernian.
And when an object is removed from a remote area, the treatment of the heavy head of the Callum Spence can then become even more stressful for Rangers.
Gerard changed eight in the Betfred Cup seminar that fired Air.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Livi 9 last week, which you had taken a number of Hearts, and he would be happy when his Drilled Drog each time made it difficult for his opponents to get their best way.
The Rangers could have had a powerful impact, but Livingston added more to the gang, which they had.
They want to be scored in two minutes when Menga had left Scott Pittman's vote sent by Allan McGregor for the first time, but the middle-fielder took advantage of his opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs met Craig Halkett, a famous free-cickier again, but his rescue partner Alan Lithgow could only try on the last post.
Rangers won but the third final was more hopeful than they believed in their game.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he should have been German for a quarter-hour sign because he and Steven Lawless had been together, but Reef Steven Thomson had handcuffed the Columbian April.
Rangers had just taken two and a half targets and signs, but the former Ibrox golfer Liam Kelly was in a simple strike and a clear challenge by Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's 34-minute-long live game may have been played, no one can deny that they were the only ones who could do so for their graffiti.
Again Rangers Jacobs failed to communicate with a deep set-up.
Scott Arfield did not respond because Declan Gallagher took the game to Scott Robinson, who took Menga for a simple meal.
Gerard appeared in the middle of it as he had changed for Ryan Kent, and Switzerland had almost gave a sudden effect that Winger shot in Morelos but actually Kelly ran from his line to block.
Although Livingston was playing the same game that they enjoyed with Lithogow and Halkett after the long game.
The team of their leader Holt could have been hit in the final reading, but McGregor and Jacobs were right to kill their head off the Lithgow corner.
The position of Ranger’s uncle Glenn Middleton was a late German because he had argued with Jacobs, but then Thomson turned his attention to him.

One test target shows higher results in various types of cancer patients.
A woman was treated with a target, which teaches the safety-belt to identify the infected cells that have been diagnosed with an endocosis of more than six months.
In the womb, the immune cells are included in the patient's cells, which change into the application so they can see HER2 protein in many cancers, and then re-inject.
Berosophsky, a professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Belize, Maryland, said: "Our results tell us that we have very good intentions."
Professor Berosophsky explained that " HER2 is carrying out the development of many cancers," including fever, endocosis, fever and coloral cancer.

This is not correct

The West's social media has been uploaded by the comedy phenomenon Chris Rock, although it has not been announced.
This is not clear if Rock is trying to play with West Posting.
West also complained to the audience that he had to take his head back and face a difficult time after lunch.
"They made fun of me after the funeral.
They said, 'Take a hat and don't go out there.'
They pressured me!
According to Washington, he said, and then they said, "I'm in a secret place."
The West went further: "Do you want to see the hidden place?" It said, "I'll get my Superman hat, because you can't tell me what it means.
Try love."
Their comments and views were at least twice as loud as six and the SNL's elected members were humiliated, and one person was quoted as saying, "All the studios were burned."
The West was later replaced by the Gayca Ariana Grande, which had been completed a few days earlier by Reper McMillir.
West wore a pair of shoes like a pair of shoes, and I was impressed by the way many people express their love for music.
West received support from the Conservet Group TypeUSE, a Canadian teenager who tweeted: "All of you feel very brave: thank you for standing in front of the group."
But Tak Shaw host Screen Hunter tweeted that West bus "is what he is and it's totally out of line."
"But I didn't choose to reward anyone (by buying music or clothing or by using "the clock")
It's simple.
He said, "That's what we are."
Reper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name before Shoe said he was now known as Kenya West in general.

Kit Harington, the artist of Game of Thrones, shot at a wide range of deaths
Kit Harrington is known as Jon Snow for his violent media fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But Nick, 31, who's been influenced by the story of Machao Nik, says that watching such roles often means boys who feel like they want to be girls.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit says he believes that 'Something has gone wrong' and #MeToo era is how to solve the problem of premature death.
Kit, who recently married his partner in the Game of Thrones with Rose Leslie, 13 thinks they feel 'many girls' about making this happen.
He said, 'At this point, I feel so much myself, where are we wrong with dying?'
'What are we teaching men when they're growing up now?'
Kit believes that television can be considered to be a little too high to increase the number of deaths, thanks to big death leaders.
He continued: 'What is jamandu and what is read?
Is it taught on television and on the streets where young boys feel like a man?
How can we change it? I think it's really one of the big questions of our time.
For with some youths it is clear that something is wrong."
He also admitted that at the end of the next summer, the game of Thrones will not be applicable or secondary because 'the field of war and horses are still very much involved.'
Kit Sam Shepard will be a star in the life of the True West from November to November, a filmmaker and a brother who is a dock.
Recently Nick opened up that he thinks his wife's date is the best way to get out of Game of Thrones.
He said, 'I found my wife in this show, and so it gave my family my future and here's the best part of my life.'
The day Ygrite played the role of John Snow, the poet of Kitt's love, Emmy President, in the victory fantasy series.
She married Leslie's family heritage on June 7, in Scotland.
U.S. / AIDS: 14% increase in new cases in China
China has announced an increase in the number of its citizens living with the U.S.A. and Azez.
Health authorities say more than 20 people are affected in the country.
The report of the new cases was submitted in the second team alone.
There has been a change in how large numbers of cases were handled in the past.
As a result of the blood supply of loggers, in some parts of China, action is rapidly spreading.
Chinese health authorities said at a conference in the Greek press, but this has reduced the number of people suffering from H.E.V. to almost zero.
However, the number of people suffering from H.E.V. and AIDS in China is higher than the number of people under the age of ten, the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
The Chinese LGBT community is a community of H.E.I.V.
A comparison was made in China, but the opposition of LGBT people has spread.
Because of the country's price fluctuations, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who marry men will eventually marry women.
The spread of many diseases is a result of unsafe sexual security.
Since then, the Chinese government has promised to try to identify this drug as part of the drug market.
Maxin Waters denied that the staff member of the GOP senators had data, the 'risk lies' and 'Sexic theories'.
On Sunday, U.S.A., Rip Maxin Waters complained that a member of his staff posted personal information on the Wikipedia pages of three Republican U.S. Centers.
Las Angeles Democrats insisted that Daws are being run by "Altra-reit-ving" artists and websites.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter, "Truth, lie and other humiliating lies."
The U.S. has been included in the information provided by letters and phone numbers.
The title of the High Court of Serbia's Brit Kawanho was shown online by an obedient person on the Capitol Hill when listening to a report from the Senate panel on the bugs of Mr. Brét Kawanho.
Some time after Kavanhof was questioned by three senators about this information, it became known.
According to information received from Capitol Hill, such as Getway Mahers and Red States, the IP addresses that identify the source of mail were linked to the Watrs office and a member of the Wats' staff was also informed.
Vaters went on to say, "This baseless element is completely wrong and a core lie."
"My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security awareness have been shaped by these frauds and false accusations - who was not responsible for opening up this information.
It's totally wrong and a lie."
The Vator’s statement quickly discussed, including former White House press sketches and filmmakers
The Flescher wrote, "This is the wrong one."
"The fact is, she doesn't have the ability to become a member of Congress.
When any material is placed on someone that they have not done, they should not be offended.
They should not feel bad.
They should not question the motives of the accused.
They must have peace and prosperity."
Flescher, compared with the opposition of Justice Kawanhof's Democrats, was in the field, where the speakers were very angry during the Friday hearing.
Republical young people also voiced their opinion on Twitter to remove Watrs from membership in the midterm options.
"If it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Vaters said that their office had recommended the use of the gifts of this fraud and the legal revolution.
"We will announce the release of criminals," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for their actions which are destructive and dangerous to any of my work and all of my work."
Johnny English has been described as less than twice as a spy of the Rovan Atkins.
A British film has been linked to any new film to seeing the importance of the patent, and it is applicable to this restoration of the English-Commedician soup France, which began with Johnny English in 2003 and returned with the English reborn in 2011.
Are we going to live in a way that's obviously wrong and self-inspired on something? Are we going to have a new chance for the country to decide?
On any price, Pope-Ide, the innocent Aksham Johnny English has a license to begin with a new head -- their name indicates that it is a designally designed commercial design that has been designed for non-English language cinemas.
He's a real secret agent who, despite his different angles for Millim Glamer, had found a face that would contribute in a note to the war of Fire Tonnied in the 2012 U.S. U.A., Dash of Mr. Ben.
It is based primarily on the life of a sports and international person, who at one time played Fargoton Barclaycard TV in these days, has been left in trouble.
This is the latest but one or two best matches in the output.
I liked Johnny English coming to a helicopter when he wore a middle-colin suit and Rotary Blood was turning against his helmet.
Atkins Honer is on trial for the physical team, but has had a very low and current sense of justice, especially the "big" film brand, such as 007 and the mission's embassies offer themselves in a moment of self-confidence.
Hasha feels as if these children have been targeted at children rather than children, and I don't think Johnny English's underprivileged lessons are harmless, and attention-mouvial gays are focused in particular.
For a long time, the current situation is that Great Britain is in severe danger.
A cyber hacker has entered the UK's super-secreted web network, which has opened up the identification of all British agents in the map, which has been left on duty for the current agent - an unfortunate human role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last stage for a major theory, which is an admber-full-of-the-art person, who has already been completely cut down by political alchemistism: Emma Thompson is very much concerned about working with this quasi-terresa painting, but it's not very hard to work with the script.
His secret advisers informed him that, as every active Jesuit has explained, he will have to be taken out of service by someone.
And it means that Johnny English is fighting with himself, which is now appointed as a school master in the performance of a school post, but an Andrkover is running out of record subak to become an operative: there are some good gays here, such as the English school of Rock-type political accompaniment.
English was sent back to the White Hall for the US briefing and was re-enacted by Ben Miller with a long-standing sadistic boot.
Boa is now a married man who has been set up for an airstrip command, and is part of a Jali-Haki-Sticks, where the Wiki paperin has been short-lived.
Batman and Rabin are thus struggling to cope with a bad way of dealing with the Secret Service of the Great Department, where they met with O’O’Bulletova, a beautiful and attractive woman from O’Bulletova.
During this time, the Prime Minister of the Christian Church is in a dangerous position, claiming to be able to remove British computer signals: sinful Jason Volta, if taken by Leslie.
English and Boa began their sensitive high-ranking odyssy: Peter changed his way into a bottle of French restaurants; they set fire to a flanish French restaurant; they often thank Walta for the beauty of the world; and they act on the clean rule of English because they try to use an ambitious headset to make themselves known to the interior of the home of the Voltage.
The entire space is taken out in a certain way, but as it is possible and possible, there is a lot of noise on children's TV about the whole thing.
The same as changed to supersede.
And with other Johnny English films I can't help thinking: Can't British films make Brown Atkinson a role that is actually being judged on their behalf?
The library refuses to allow the British people to work four days a week, but is scheduled for five days.
Jeremy Carbin's library party is thinking about a cutting-edge project that will give the people of Britain a four-day vision -- but it's devoted to five.
The party wants the company's bus workers to spend more time on children by means of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Middle Ages.
And they that work with him shall enjoy the sabbath of three days; yet that day they shall be every one that worketh therein.
The authorities said this idea would be "fit" with the party's financial agency and the country would be on the side of the parties.
The four-day trader of the week is one way to take advantage of the changing financial situation that has been imposed by the Union Congress.
A senior leader of the Liberian party told Indian Times: 'It's expected to be a regular reporter before the end of the year.
'This will not be night-night, but the four-day process is a week's drive that sits on the party's side with all the automatic performance of the party-in-the-night business to adjust the financial situation of the party.'
The Libre party will not be the first to make such an opinion, Green Party launched a four-day program during its general election of the 2017 party.
The library is not completely blanked in use, yet it is not fully supported by the library party.
A member of a liberary party said: 'The four-day process is not a week party and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor Jean McDaniel used last week's temporary conference to offer his views on a social cult in a financial situation.
Shery McDaniel said she was determined to return from the use of France to receive an invitation from 'unprofit guides' and 'motors'.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the companies that use it will not be able to get their full share back because the public library could 'debt' on the basis of misinformation.
He also arranged to build a cooperative management fund to provide 10 percent of the types of private area for workers on board the company's board and to provide them with a total of £500 per year.
The Lindsey Grahams, Jean Canadians say in "60 minutes" whether an AFB scan can change their brains
The EFBIA survey of J. Bret Kwanho's play-off Europeans has taken at least one week to finalize their appointment in the Supreme Court, and raises the question whether the results of the Bureau should be supported by any Republican senators
In an interview on Sunday, "60 minutes" letter sent by Skat Pelle asked the Republican Senate. Jean-Candy and Lindsey wanted to know if Efbia could also find something that would move them to change their mind.
Canada showed more clearly in comparison with her partner in South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Canada.
"I'm going to the hearing, I'm saying, I've spoken to Judge Kwanho.
I called him that after he was like that, this element came forward, said, 'What did you do?'
He was firm, firm, without any doubt."
The volume of the volume, even if it is non-replaceable.
"I have developed my opinion about Bret Kwanho and it will be a dynamic weapon," they said.
"D. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret broke so hard," Graham said, quoting Christine Blassie Ford.
"And no one who has named them can confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I'm not seeing any new changes.
What is the Global Positioning Festival, and has it contributed to the reduction of poverty?
This Saturday will be held at the New York Global Position Festival, a peaceful music programme in which a beautiful series of stars is an impressive motion and a mission of equal influence; ending world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, tens of thousands of people will come to the Grand Lun of Central Park in the Global Sitisan Festival, not only to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardie Bee and the beautiful Mandes, but to take care of the real goals of the 2030 programme to end poverty.
The Global Positioning Festival, which began in 2012, is an institution of the World Poverty Project, which is an international time-consuming group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people struggling to combat it.
To get a free ticket for convenience (when you were not ready to submit for a ticket), musicians had to perform many tasks, or tasks, such as e-mailing a world leader, calling a phone. Use calls or other military means to help increase your goal of eliminating poverty.
But how successful has global warming been for 12 years in achieving its goal?
Is it a real way to motivate people to work with a free music program, or is it just a matter of clickivism - people are becoming like they're making a difference online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, it has been said that it has forced more than 19 million actions from its supporters to address different goals.
It says that these efforts have helped world leaders to make an estimated $37 billion in order to affect the lives of more than $2.25 billion in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group gave comments on 390 representations and declarations from its work, of which at least $10 billion has been distributed or collected before.
The group estimates that some 649 million people around the world have been directly affected by security funds so far.
Some of the important issues include power off innovation, which is based on the UU that takes action, "which is designed to help children grow up to their full potential," has been promised to provide $35 million in order to help them finish their compositing after more than 4,700 tweets from the Global Position.
With the support of the British government, the Danish, the national governments, and the Global Situation, we can reduce the social injustice of one foot-note in history, as you can see, during the Live Music Programme in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 efforts to improve the supply of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced a single payment for the project, the power of the supply, which will reach up to 5 million women and children by providing the supply intervention.
Do you think you can answer the questions asked on this website, "Can we end poverty?"
The world's citizen answered, "It's gonna be a long and hard way -- sometimes we'll get caught and fail.
However, like our great civil authorities and anti-coloured inputs, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, Wikkend, Shan Mendes, Cardie Bee, General Monai New York are among those who contribute to this year's meeting, which will be held in Debora Lee France and now Jakman.
U.S.A. can be used as a water-sustainment to get "fucking" in Russian energy exports.
According to Washington researcher, Washington, if the Russian forces were to rise in the middle of the Middle East, they could use their water to prevent the rise of the Russian forces in the market.
As a result, Russia's activity in Syria - especially in the form of a Russian government - is an excuse to identify new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why he is in the Middle East is that he wants to do the same with energy as they do in Eastern Europe, to the south of Europe," they insisted.
And, according to the authority, there are ways and means of removing it.

It is reported that in Europe, the Tromp Management is on a mission to increase its traditional natural gas exports, Russia's most efficient option for European users.
To that effect, U.S. President Donald Trump of the United States attempted to force Germany to withdraw from the "Indebted" North Stream 2 pipeline application, which, according to the trumpet, became "the closure" of Berlin Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that $11 billion in North Stream 2 pipelines, which is ready to double current pipeline power by 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean financial use.
Cremlin's evidence is that Washington's campaign against the use is only motivated by economic reasons and is an example of an inappropriate confrontation.
"I believe that we share the idea that energy cannot be a substance to study pressure and must be able to select the uses (splier)," Russian Energy Minister Vugjo Novak said in September in Moscow after a sitting with the American Energy Sculpture Rik Perry. The Russian Power can use the U.S.
The U.S. government has withdrawn from Germany, which has challenged its responsibility for its application.

Senator Elizabeth Varen of Massachusetts told Saturday that they would take a serious look at the election for the presidential term as they looked at the mid-term election.

The U.S. Prime Minister has launched an educational campaign with China and Pakistan.
A powerful Chinese newspaper conducted a study of four pages in the US a week after the US daily American-China business, and the US government in China blamed the use of the US press to spread advertising.
The U.S. National D.A. Troppel referred to the Chinese D.A.'s pay supplement on Friday - November 6 - U.S., to try to enter China.
The trick is that businessing was trying to get into the U.S. options, when U.S. officials told Reuters that it was a great job to get China and pressure.
While this is common in order to allow foreign governments to increase trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war, which has seen them increase the level of tariff on one another's imports.

China, Franceste wrote in a Rai in the Des Mainz Register of Sunday, "Now we are doing our free press preaching education by means of force."

The Republicans have already separated themselves from Kavanho, a global warning.
Several small republics have supported and saved Bret Kwanho, the manager of a number of body attacks, and has warned that he will see a response during midterm elections, especially from women.
The feelings surrounding it have been very high, and most republicans have already shown that they want to move forward with votes.
These things can't be removed behind the scenes, "A professor of political science at the Max School of Sirecius University, Grant Rehir, told Saturday about the release of an article.
Reyhar said he was skeptical that Senator Jeff Flakes (Arisona) would be enough to make peace with the voters who came in the last time in anger.
No matter what happens, women don't forget her - they won't even forget about it in November," according to the newspaper Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the delegates said "November is coming!" as they showed in the Senate hall that the Republicans who were governing the Nepalese committee decided to proceed with Kwanho's appointment despite Dr.
"Democratic encouragement and movement are closing the map," Stu Rothenberg, a non-participated political analyst, told the new news site.
"People are saying it's already high, it's right.
But it can be high, especially women (who can vote for any candidate) in voters and young voters, between 18 and 29 years of age, when they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Prior to Ford's public testimony that the name of the Supreme Court is a description of the weapons of attack against a person, observers suggested that there could be an obstacle if the Republicans continued with the attack.
"This has become a very confusing problem for the secret," said Michael Stela, former Chairman of the National Committee of the Republican, at the beginning of last week's Ambisse News.
"It's not just about a committee vote or about the final vote or that Kwanho has been sitting in the bank (the Supreme Court Court Court's court), it's also about how the Republicans have handled it and how they have used it," said the director of gay Social, Puritan America, a group that helps choose Democrats, New Channel.
However, the Americans are divided into a few limits that after Ford and Kwanho's testimony (after later) are confirmed, they are soon on the side of those.
A new survey from Yeugov shows that 41 percent believed in the Witness of Ford, while 35 percent said that he believed in the Witness of Kwana.
In addition, 38 percent said that they think that Kwannoah may be lying or lying during his witnessing period, while 30 percent say so about Ford.
After the flake's signal (explain), the FBI is currently investigating the charges of at least one other charge, Debora Ramirez's Guardian said.
Ford testified before the National Committee of the Senate during the last week and during the summer, that Kwanho had been drinking alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramírez charged that the owner of the Supreme Court had put his life in a party when he was reading in the 1980s.

The company now has a security platform for Burners-Leaths, Bruce, purchased by EBIM, which has agreed to work on some staff developers' projects and projects, and is a community of Voltaire Codes.
At the start of this week, advanced developers around the world can create their own developers, using the Input website and the available tools.
Burnersley said that he and his team aren't talking to Facebook and Google because they're not going to be able to offer a complete change, where all their business models are all up at night.
"We are not asking for their obedience."
In a post published on Sunday in the media, Burners-Le writes that the aim of the attack is "to provide a market power and is a natural tool for maintaining equality and a quality for building solids and webs."
In 1994, Burners-Li changed the Internet by setting up a World Wide Web Consortium in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, a powerful voice has been heard in the Berners-Le Net Security Base.
Even if you start the project, Burns-Le World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute will be the founder and directory.
"I hope very much for the next time on the web," Burners-ley said.
Bernard Wayne: Double Double Double 1 Victoria Cross Claric
In order to win the Victoria Cross during World War I, the only Church of England's clergy considered it a war in their neighboring city 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Richard Bernard Van won a victory in the attack on Bellenglish and Lehocort on September 29, 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had won the highest-level British military force.
On Saturday, a stone was erected in a park in Northamptonshire, where a stone had been dug by a stone's thrower.
One of them, Michael van said it was a "beautiful ring," which would have appeared almost 100 years from his grandfather's victory worker (Kertob).
According to London Gest, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led a heavy fight against St. Quentin in the Battalion River, where he was led by many organized storms and floods and machine mines."
Later he went to the firefighting line and took a field-block with "Great Badry" before he was handcuffed and pulled out three different pieces (he won).
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German synapist on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said that they were the deeds of his father, "I know I could never complete them, but there's something that's going to be less important.
He and his brother, D. James Van, were killed after the plague, led by the Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he was "very privileged to participate in the parade," and he said, "a real niki baker was shown by support that is being done by many people."
The U.S.S. battalion was stopped all night to see 206 fighters, and they were given a look at the paper pig (a British cartoon serial).
Imagine this: You have been stopped all night looking at a 206-pack battery and have refused to see the main program.
San José had 13 disputes in Bill, six of which were on the main cards and were shown at night in Yuke by channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gejard Mosasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to meet each other, the audience in Yuke was immediately surprised when the cave was transformed into a paper page.
They were particularly surprised after the initial hours for some wars.
Twitter and a supportr described the child's cartoon as "some kind of fun."
"This is a government rule that this content was not appropriate until 6:00 a.m., so they had to change into children's programmes," said the President of the Marketing and Transport's Belater Junior Prize, Dave Schwartz, when asked about the preaching.
"Yes" Papa Ping.
The Batter Company's chief Scott Cooker said they're working all their time to join the audience in the future.
"I guess when I think about Ripple, I think we might be able to work on it," Koker said.
"In the morning, it will not be possible to complete this work by six o'clock in the morning and on Sunday until its appointed time, according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it changed, many writings were old and not like all friends.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government.
I can promise you it won't be the next time.
We're going to keep it down in the bottom five wars -- as we usually do -- and we're trying to give praise too much, and we're just eating it like this.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island ( island) Disks: Tom Dale felt 'Jotty' over fatigue
Olmpic Gothachor Tom Dalla says he has become more and more violent because of his sexuality.
The 24-year-old says he didn't experience it until he didn't go to high school, "No one like me."
Speaking about the first radio 4 laser Irish disks offered by Lauren Librin, he said he spoke about the same rights to give others "as."
He also said that being a father makes him more useful for winning the Olympics.
The regular provider of long-term show, Kristy Young, has been shut down for months because of illness.
The first show of Librein's program and Castave (an American drama film), Dale said that she felt "a lot less than who" who are growing up because "it's not possible to be accepted as a socialist and as a child and as a girl."
He said, "To this day, their feelings are diminished, and theirs is the real feeling of those who have given me the power and the power to overcome them."
She wanted to prove that she was "beautiful," she said, so when she found out about her immediate relationship, she didn't disappoint everyone.
Two times in the Olympics, the Kansas model victory has become a high-profile Algebite publisher, and this year in Australia has been attended by the Commonwealth Games in order to appeal to other countries to rescue the crimes.
He said he said because he felt happy without any opposition to live openly and wanted to give others a "yes."
Three times the World Championship said to love a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom they met in 2013 - "I was surprised."
Dalle worked with Askar Evard Winner, who was 20 years older than he, but he said there was no difference in age.
"When you're so young," she went to Olimpic at the age of 14 and died three years after her father died of cancer -- she said that finding someone at the same age would be very difficult for you to experience your own good and bad.
In June the couple became the mother and father of a son, Robert Ree Black-Dala, and Dale said that he had changed "full vision."
"If you asked me last year, it was all for him, 'I had to win the gold ring," he said.
"You know, there are more things here than the Olympic gold.
My Olympic gold medals are a ruby."
His son’s name is Roberts, who died in 2011 during a 40-year-old breast cancer study.
He said that his father didn't agree, he was dying, and one of the last things they asked if they had tickets to London 2012 so they could sit in the first row.
"I couldn't say to him (my father) 'Father, you're not even sitting on the first row'," he said.
"I touched her hand and she stopped taking care of her. And it wasn't until she stopped taking care of her and she died, and finally I realized that she wasn't bad," he said.
The next year, Dale took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the victory of the cans.
"I knew how I had seen the dream of all life -- that there would be no better experience for the group in the Olympics," he said.
He was moved by his first song's favorite -- by the hero material -- who hated him in the construction of the Olympics and has so far set up their colors.
He will come to the Desert Island Disc Saturday at 11:15 (by Beesty time) on Bebessi Radio 4.
Michaelson, who appears to be a bad guy, was thrown out on Saturday to play in the Rider's safe.
The U.S. Phil Michaelson will build a record when he meets 47 of his radar cap but he will have to come in his entire shape to save him from this rough millpstone.
Captain James Förck, from playing 12-year-old account for the record, released Saturday morning and afternoon (children playing in a radar cover).
Instead of being the center of action, as she often does for the United States, the main winner five times divided his day into a cheerleader and his game career, which he felt bad about.
At the end of his career, he could never play the most direct player, and at the age of 48, he was not able to play a golf national course, where he regularly beats round-the-clock shots.
And if these aren't too difficult for their own courses, on Sunday, 9th Max'ch Michaelson, the right British open champion Francisco Molineri, who has formed a team with Tommy Fleetwood to win all his four matches this week.
If the Americans are less than four numbers than the start of the 12 singles match, don't be quick to play, the mix of Michaelson can be completely out of hand.
Faric expressed his faith to his servant, and he could not say anything more.
"What he did today had fully understood the role of Ody, he set me up and held his hand around me and said that he would be ready for the moment," Furik said.
"He's got a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a hall of firmer, and he's added a lot this week to these teams, and this week.
I may have thought he was playing two games.
I thought another way, but it's the way it worked, and so we thought it was the way we'd have to go.
He wants to go there like everyone else."
The most common player in the game will be pasted after a track record of Nick Faldo played.
This could indicate the end of the career of the driver that does not match the height of his personal record.
Michaelson's 18 wins, 20 winnings and seven winnings, although Förck said his presence gave the team some strength and self-confidence.
"He's sick, he's sick, he's funny, he likes to cut people's teeth, and he's good enough to be in team room," he said.
"I think the little player should have gone with him about the game, as well as this week, he got to see the game.
She gives more than she does."
European Captain Thames Bjoronn knows that Bug Lide (an American blog newspaper) may soon be lost.
The European Captain, Thames Bjoronn, knows from his experience that the title of the lead found in the Rider Cup can easily be changed into a safe journey in the last day's season.
Dan played his first game in Valdrama in 1997, where a team of U.S. Balesters, captain of Siv Balsters, took advantage of five points, but won only 14(1/2) by 13(1/2) numbers, with very little money, finished the financial line winning their own.
"You remind yourself that we were a very large leader in Valdrama; our great leader in Brooklyn, where we lost and where we won, but Bijorn just told us that we had led with the Li Golf National Team on Friday and July 5, 2018.
So history will tell me, and everyone is in his team that's not over.
You will become a burden to me.
Go there and do all the good things.
It won't end until you get the board and its numbers.
We have a goal, and this is to try to overcome this traffic, and that's where to pay attention.
I've been telling you everything, I'm focusing on the 12 players who are with us, but we know exactly what's on the other side -- the world's biggest players."
It's very nice how his players showed up in a strong golf course, Giggorn said: "I will never grow up in this.
The future is a dangerous animal.
The future will be a personal display that comes next, and it's for different things.
It's best to go there with your partner when you're doing a good job, when you're actually there, and then you're tempted to do your best as a golfer.
This is the message which you have to reach for for a player, which will only make up for your own best efforts.
Now, you leave your mate behind and he has to go and get the best of himself."
On the contrary, Jim Furik, unlike the number, is looking at his players in a different way than his peers, leaving Jordan Smith and Justin Thames, who obtained three numbers in four.
Faric himself was on both sides of the great final days, when he was part of a team winning in Brooklyn before a Luger (Harn) win, as Europe did "miracles in Medina".
"I remember every bad word like that," said the President of Benin in his reply, "how he prevented his players from joining the race on the last day.
"Kaleh is our 12th match, but you should start as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this is done one side of the volume, it is very much the pressure between them.
We've been fully prepared in our line and we've kept the boys on the line that we liked, you know we're doing some miracles tomorrow."
Thames has been commissioned to lead and support Rory microroe in the most diverse match, including the players from Europe in the first half of Europe.
"I went in this order with the boys of this group because I think it's going to be completely buried," said Georgen in his Senegalese Selecions.
The new German archipelago was rebuilt once again
The German Navy had ordered the newest frigate of the German Navy in 2014 to change the version of the times of the Cold War. But the next year it was not possible to be the cause of loss and less cost, the local media reported in a report.
The new Baden-Wertmberg-class frigate's lead ship "Ryanland-Pflas" has now been valued for the first half of 2019, from the text of the military Spocksman (Vice) according to the Diaget News.
Wessel should be included in the show in 2014, but the potential for the post-divary market has threatened the future of the encouraging project.
The four-bedn-Wertmberg-class sailing ships will be replaced by the old Burmese-Shirdships, which was returned by the command of Navy N.N. (J.S.) in 2007.
This is thought to be used with a powerful wave, anti-aircene and anti-ship missiles for some steel techniques such as reducing radar, infrared and fast signals.
Other important features are that it should not be repeated so long as new Frigates are separated from their surroundings for almost two years.
Although it would be a long time before the warships were in danger, Germans were told to allow a project to be launched abroad - it would be old when they started the service, Di Gate wrote in a note.
The F.C.F. Warship was in security last year, when Germany refused to give money to the ship as an authority and returned it to the Lom And Fass in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the shipmaker was returned to the shipmaker after his flight.
There was very little information about the reasons for the ship's return, but the German media said "software and hardware damages" were not capable of any war.
The software's defects were more important because the Baden-Wottmberg ship will be driven from the heart of the ships which are half the number of former Bramin fighters.
It has also been found that the ship's weight is much higher which reduces its capacity and prevents nine teams from getting new things in the future.
In contrast to the ships of the same type, it is believed that the two brothers of the Reinland-Flags, who are in charge of the same ship, are considered to be two.
In addition to the poor hardware, the cost of training the driver's heart was also becoming one of the costs of the entire project.
It is said that the price - starting from €2.2 billion to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) was reached.
The recent warnings of the German Navy, the new warships, and the arrests of the German army are making it important for us not to be caught.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Barrettles, head of the committee of the German Society, believed that nine cents were actually "loss of ships capable of sinking".
The authority said this was more important and more important at the same time, because the former ships had been decommissioned, but no other ship had been taken.
He was sad that no warship of Baden-vottmberg could be included in the Navy.
National Trust has a secret life and a secret way of looking at the lights.
A new research carried out in an area of the Skatish Islands reveals how they use soil vision to find light food.
It is hoped that this research will provide insight into the nature and nature of this flying animal and will help guide the future of safe speeds.
In a study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, it will be common to be found in the Inverv Garden in Western Days, Sepranno Pepistraal, full-length cones and Dobton light.
Some special locations and recorders will be taken to keep track of the speeds and the speeds of the full weather.
With manipulative detectors, the activity of ANESTS and even the help will provide small-scale services.
With the special development of all records, the lighthouses will be able to detect the brightness of the sound and will also know what kind of action they are doing.
A map and a report will then be presented, based on a detailed map of their appearance and images.
The natural storage consultants of the Andes, Rob Dever, hope that the results will show what habitats are most important for the lighthouses and how they are used by each of the lighthouses.
This information will help to improve the conservation of forests for forest areas and forests and other populations associated with them.
The generation of lighthouses in Scotland and Yuke is much smaller than the previous century.
It's dangerous to create and develop these things that affect their well-being and their survival.
The chemical treatment of airborne and herbicides, flake paper and construction materials can also be a cause of infection by palatu bees.
In fact, there's no bright eyes.
Although the usual reason for their night of sacrifice is that their ears are more useful than their eyes for sacrifice.
They use modern space technology to detect storms and obstacles on their way.
Antis, which has a heavy responsibility for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important plants and 76,000 hectares throughout the country, are responsible for the protection of the planet.
It has ten trained professionals who work regularly to monitor, study and save several times.
The organization has established the first and only reserv of Scotland in the Drive Astate of Dumfriz and Gallove, which is dedicated to lighthouses and is home to eight populations in the ten lighthouses of Scotland.
Asset's manager, David Thomson, says this place is an ideal place for them to live.
"There's a very good place to lighthouses here," he said.
We have old buildings, old trees and good places to rest.
But there's still much confusion about the lights that haven't been found, so the work done here and elsewhere will help them understand what they need to move forward."
It emphasizes the importance of examining the lights before they are cleaned up because any damage to the lives of women and young people is likely to result in the destruction of the environment.
It is illegal to kill, torture, or destroy the victims.
Bat Conference Officer Elizabeth Ferrel encouraged people to help.
He said, "We are still busy with the lights, and we do not know how their sound is going."
Ronaldo is paying for the charges of the Holocaust and is ready to execute by the German agents.
Christano Ronaldo presents the charges against him as a "false message" and says that people want to make themselves known by using his name.
His colleague, German News Magazine Dr. Spigel, in which these claims were published, is ready to be tried.
An American woman named Catherine Mayor was charged with rape in a room at Las Vegas Hotel in Portugal and Juventes Farvard in 2009.
According to Dr. Spigel's report, he's been blamed for giving the woman $1,500 to keep her secret about this incident.
A few hours later, in a live video of the drama, Ronaldo,  resided in his 20 million wishers, who called the reports "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
They said today, the false news, "Balone Dior won five times in the camera."
"They want to use my name to spread the bus to themselves.
It's common
They want to be known by my name, this is part of the job.
The player smiled, and he went on, "I'm a happy man and everything's fine."
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's attorneys are preparing to judge him "on the basis of suspicions in the field of business," he says.
Vakile Christian Schretz said the player will be awarded "a similar to the depth of growing up, moral damage, which may be the most serious of his own powers in recent years,"
It is said that this event will take place in a suite at the pama hotel and casino in Las Vegas on June 5th.
According to the paper presented in the Klark County District Court, after meeting a Night club, Ronaldo and Meorga returned to the room where the player raped Majorga.
Meorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo hit the tires and said he's a good boy, but he's lost from a "fist".
The documents claim that Ronaldo claimed that the couple had saved, but it was in agreement with the storage.
Meorga claims she was approached by the police and her pictures were taken at the hospital, but later she agreed to discuss it outside the court because she was afraid of "change" and "social humiliation."

Bridget: Yuka will always regret 'losing those who make them.'
Business Sector Greg Clarke said that if Yuke lost the most important role in building bridges in the world after Bridgezit, "You will always regret it"
He went on to say that it's interesting that Toyota Yuke told Bibisi that if Britten left Jehu without any sale, she would soon stop producing in her factory near Bernady.
"We need a sale," said Sir Clark.
The Japanese wall manufacturer said that the long-term long-term effects of unskilled explosives can have a bad effect on workers and workers.
Burnaston Plant - which is built by Orice and Avess of Toyota - has been developed in the last few and eight years, of which about 0% have been exported to the rest of the European Union.
Marvin Kuck, managing director of Toyota in Bernaston, said, "My point of view is that if we were outside the European Union at the end of the British March, we would stop production in our factory."
In addition to the construction of other streets in Yuka, India, BiomdBlüu and Jaguar Landrover have also voiced their fear that they would not agree with Jehu.
For example, BIAMBELLYU said he would close his little plant for a month after Braggzit.
The main concern for wall construction is that there are areas of concern for the construction of walls without any agreement.
Toyota's production line is based on "Jest In-Time" where every 37 minutes, parts of the Uke and European Union have been built to build ordered walls.

Toyota said it would be impossible to keep more than a day's worth in her business plan, and therefore the production would be stopped.
Siri Man Clarke said my teacher Theresa "is in the right mail to stop the investigation of the Draft Plan Bars in the future."
"We need a sale. We want the best sale, which will not only make us happy to be successful, but also give us the opportunity to take advantage of this opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio programme today.
"Not only Toyota but also other structures have the result that the highly successful implementation of the Spleen War is necessary for us to keep it fully under control."
Toyota was unable to say how long the production would be stopped, but looking at the length, it was warned that the large scale will reduce the size of the planet and eventually reduce the temperature.
Peter Sowlaris, who has worked for 24 years in the Brunaston region and who is the Convenient of the United Union of Plants, said that their members are also worried about "I think that if these jobs were once gone, they would never come back.
A government bell said, "We should offer a firm and reliable plan for our future with Jehu."
The White House says it can be back at a trip and a meeting of Roznstein.
The White House told Sunday that the name of the Supreme Court was due to the war that was taking place on Bret Connoah, the Donald Tramp and the Duptie Ataarni General Rod Rozenstein, at a high-level meeting "may last another week."
Special adviser to Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Miller, who investigates the internal affairs of Russia's elections and checks the relationship between the support of the troops and the possible obstacles between the Russians and the State.
For several months, it has been in Washington, D.C., that the trumpet detective will either get General off his job or not, with which he will have miller's freedom in the field or not.
At the beginning of this month, a New York Times report said that Rosinstein used a star to record a conversation with the trumpet and discussed how it was possible to eliminate the government through this configuration.
Rosenstein denied the report
But last night he went to the White House, and he was going to give his astrophysics during these reports.
But instead, the trumpet, which was then in the United States of America, was announced on Friday.
Tripp said he would "not like to get Rosinstein out of work", but he went to the meetings to hear the report of the Senate Committee and to stop the harassment at the meeting, when he heard the committee's hearing, and a woman, Dr. Christine Blasie Ford, who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, the tramp ordered a week's investigation of the materials on Kavanoh, and then a full synthesis vote.
The trumpet press sector, Sarah Sanders, offered focus news on Sunday.
When he asked about the daily meeting, he said, "No date has yet been set for this meeting, maybe this week, I can see that this meeting can be postponed for another week by doing the remaining things in the Supreme Court."
But we'll look at it, and I'd like to keep the press up.
Some writers object to this claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference on White House after September 10th.
Mazeban Chris Wells asked why
Sanders said that after a few press conferences, the reason he didn't like TV's poster, "That's right," although he said, "I can't deny this place that they're very high."
He then suggested that direct contact between the trimp and the press be increased.
He said, "The President is facing more questions than any other president," without any evidence, he went on to say, "We've seen this number."
These questions will remain with the press, Sanders said, "But if the press has an opportunity to ask questions directly to the president, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying very hard to do this, and you've seen us do this many times in the last few weeks, and there'll be a press conference in which you can talk directly to the President of the United States.
When leaving the White House or taking part in open sessions or when attending a press conference with large people, the trumpet regularly accepts questions.
There are very few press conferences together.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why lettermakers should be treated in a free and often agjibo-poor way.
The health sector writes about the fear of AIDS in Scotland
The health sector in Scotland's ANAS writes to thank EU workers for their country and expresses their desire to shut them down even after their budgets.
Gen Freeman Emspy sent a letter when Yuka had less than six months to leave Yuka's Jehu.
The Scottish government had already approved the purchase of fixed-state applications for EU citizens who were working in its public services.
In his letter, the honourable Freeman wrote: "The potential for a decision is growing to the point where all the heat, electricity and electricity are running low.
But the U.S. government is increasing its readiness to look at a potential market.
I know it's a very vulnerable time for all of you.
So I want to say again now that I am not fully aware of the abilities of every member of Staff.
The patient, valuable experience and experience of Jehu and its predecessors, who strengthen and improve the work of health services, and who benefit from the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we want you to stay here."
After his fall, Christian Aberconbie's american agency was established.
Mike Og of Tennessee reported that the tennis state tigers' linebacker Christian Aborigine, after the fall of head, was killed by the US when they were destroyed by the Wenderbyt Comodores on Saturday.
The chief coache Rod Ride of the tennis court told the authors that it had begun some time before it was half past midnight
Reed said, "He came to the side line, and he just walked there."
The trainers and medical workers gave him a seat line before they put him on the striker and returned for more consideration.
An authority from the Danish state told Chris Harris of the BlueGUSAMVI crisis outside the Aberconby Service at the Wenderbilt Medical Center.
Harris went on to say, "There's still no information about the type/ depth of the seat" and the tennis state is trying to figure out when this seat is down.
Abrührnby, a red shirt, a second year's high school student, is in his first session with the tennis state after the change from Illinois.
Before going out of the game, Saturday was its total number of tracks, with the total number of tracks in its scene.
Foreign buyers will be required to buy and buy more stamps in the U.S.
Foreign buyers will be given a large stamp duty and will be used to assist homeless people under the new Tori scheme.
This action will reduce the success of the Corbin movement in attracting young votaries.
People who don't fill the boxes in the case of Yuke will be added to the stamp duty.
The treasure is expected to collect up to £8 million in a year to help homeless people.
Theresa will now announce that foreign buyers will be able to buy in the U.S. and use a larger stamp duty to help people who are homeless.
This action will undermine the success of the action of the German Corbin to attract young voters and provide quality relief to the poor and on the other hand mark the rich.
The increase in the stamp duty will be attributed to people who don't pay taxes in the U.S. and who fight with government money without problems at home.
The Church - which must be different from the current Stamp Duty, where two years ago increased over other houses and purchases, may be three times more expensive.
The treasure is expected to grow to £8 million in one year.
London's rate of 13 percent of new buildings are purchased by residents of G.A., which increases prices and makes it even more difficult for those who buy houses for the first time.
Many of the country's rich parts - especially in the capital - have become "Guest Town" because many foreigners spend their time outside their country.
In order to make young people easily buy their first home, Boris Johnson has reduced the stamp duty for young people and this new policy only weeks later.
He accused large structures of buying and using the land, not using it, and called on me to remove the amount of houses from Britain's "homelessness".
Sriman Corbin offered an eye-browsing improvement in which blood flow and control and "no-default" is over.
He wants to give the councils more power to build a new house.
I said, "Last year I said I'm going to dedicate my life to rehabilitating the British dream -- every new generation should be better.
And that means we're improving the market for our abandoned houses.
Britain will always be open to those who want to stay here, work, and spend their lives here
However, it is not right for them to buy a house here just like the British people who work hard here.
For many people the dream of buying a house has gone far away, and without having to sleep in it, it has become a reality for them.
Jack Rose: 'My last wish is to organize Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says he should be the manager of his "final dream" Scotland when he comes to a lecture.
Scott, . . . ., is making a decision to reorganize the North-East Club, which is now in the third position in the log, from the first three points.
After leading St. Miran in the course of the course of the Skatish High School in the last six months, he went to the stadium in the summer.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B-cap and this was the end of it, "Ros told the voice of the BBC Scotland game.
"But with my father, I grew up looking at Scottland in Hempden, and it was something that kept me going back.
But this opportunity can only come if I succeed in organizing the club.
The laws of Dick Advocet, David Moose, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neill, Roeken, Gus Poet and Paulo include the laws of the Russians as well as the Sunland Manager.
Previously on Aloa Athletic Bus said he had no great feeling at all about the names set up in such a large club after his first encounter with Barnissley and Ipswich Town.
"At this time, I'll be able to get the ratio of success so that I can get this club back into the Premier's log?"
He said, "Looking at the walls and facilities of this club, it should be included without any doubt in the Prime Minister's log."
It's not easy to get the club back there, but I might be successful here if I could get this club back there."
After 15 months of training in the Dwarton-supported Bus and Harthts, Russia's management career has been only three years.
And then he threw Aloa into or out of the third row, and St. Meren arrived at the scene's championship account.
And Russia said she feels more comfortable now than she does at the club, Hartpole, Falcker, St. Meren and Hamilton Academy.
He mentioned taking responsibility for Aloa, saying, "It's probably a real move."
I really believed that it was better for me to manage than to play.
It can happen now because I've done well, I've lived a good life with it, and sometimes I've also enjoyed high joy.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to do a lot of things on a weekly basis.
I'm still under pressure and work pressure, but I'm still doing it right.
I always wanted to organize things, and now I'm doing it, I feel the most comfortable in my life now, like I'm in my own light."

Greme's heat has increased the strength of Britain's fighting popes but has increased pressure on the restaurant's teas.
In July the sales of groups of popes and de d'Darrows increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants there are less than 4.8 percent.
Business consultant, Peter Martin of CJE, who prepared the eggs, said: "The long-lasting explosion and the long-lasting wave of activity in England's global climate was still as long as June last month, with an increase of 2.8 percent in the bees, but the state of restaurant was even more difficult.
In June, the restaurant's 1.8-fifty-gravt shop was still in July.
How much more are the pope and the bar storanta preferred and the state of the restaurant is very poor?
Even the sun's rising in the sun's atmosphere, but it's not as spectacular as the restaurant.
People just wanted to go out for a drink.
For this month, there's been an increase in sales of rice in organized beans and vegetables.
Armes of Paul Neuman, entertainment and guest artists said: "These results have been seen since the end of April that are still going on.
The impact of weather and major social events on the economy is greater than that of the outside market.
It is not surprising that there will be an ongoing conflict for the restaurant group, as sales of 4.8 francs are under way every year and more expensive is becoming more harmful.
This long-term hot food has brought a bad time for operators, and now it's going to tell us that it's going to be very necessary for them to be allowed in mid-August."
With new open popes and restaurants this year, the total sales increase by 2.7 per cent in July, which represents the slow process for branda.
Cooper Pitch Trainer, an independent sales monitor, combines operating groups of 47 Popes, Bars and Restaurants, with a total Trenover of £1 billion, and develops a line of activity.
Five of them are a child's secret social media account that he hides from his parents.
One survey shows how many children up to seven years of age are the secret social media account of a five-year-old who hides it from his parents and teachers.
The number of secondary schools, the number of children, has increased in the "Jailey Institute" pages.
This news has increased the fear that sexual content is being posted.
20 percent of students said they have a "human" account to show parents.
In the last 10 years, one out of five children has a secret social media account that she hides from adults.
The number of secondary schools, the number of children, has increased in the "Jailey Institute" accounts - a site that shares photos.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is being posted.
20 percent of students say they use simple "human" accounts to show their parents, and they also have their own own account.
A mother who mistakenly approached her 8-year-old child's secret site saw that a young woman and others were saying, "Talk me."
A study conducted by the Digital Adventures and Headmasters and Headmasters Conferences (Achamsy) found that between 11 and 18 years of age, about 40 percent of children had their own personal accounts.
Ahmsey Chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's very disturbing that many young people are building online places where parents and teachers can't find them."
El Doyle will be "The Voice of Athletics" in the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eli Doyle was selected as a non-functional director at the annual Governing Body of the Board of Scotland Athletics.
Doyle Scotland's best-known track and field athlete and Cheerman Ian Betty said it was a very good move, saying it's a very great opportunity for them to benefit from the great experience of Doyle's international level.

Doyle said, "I am very excited to work as a voice to the athletes, and I hope I can run this game in Scotland and help carry it out."
America's player, who won a total of 20 meters and a total of 20 meters of gold models in Atlanta, was unable to perform an act of chemical activism and has now become a master of the bassy.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I was shocked today.
I can't go back.
The doctors said I'd be fine or not, and if I'd be, it'd only tell me the time.
That was a terrible job, but now I am very busy, learning to walk from the beginning, and today I am driving!
Thank you for the message of comfort.
The spider’s wings that compares mother’s milk to eggs divide into online rays.
A company with a pump of tea has been online in ideas compared to a year ago that compares nursing mothers to singing.
To show the start of the "The First World Cup of Coalitions", the professional technical company Alvey has been doing this by creating a talk-like music video that has been offered to mothers to use it for their mothers.
Four real moms play a song and sing in the back of a piece of songs, where they say, "Yes, I'm hurting myself, but I won't show you any gods" and "If you didn't see that they're not crazy but they're my moms."
The song goes on: "Pick it out, Punch it, I'm drinking my children's milk, Punch it, I'm giving my women milk."
However, the Facebook page of the farm and published story produced online controversy.
With 77,000 voices and hundreds of comments, the video received a positive response from viewers, many of whom are saying that it represents the "failure" of the daily performance.
"It's a very wrong decision to use songs in this production.
One wrote, "There must be poverty to give them as we do, but after their children are born, they are robbed in days."
Alvey punctuation nursery (alvi/ma) is properly generated inside the alvey
Another commented: "This is a mental burden for both mothers and children.
But why not use them to make sure that they have a copy of the brochure for those who are able to help their children?
Another said, "This is a long time ago."
Others saved this story, one woman admitted that she had become a "prosperous" singer.
"I think it's an experimental idea.
If I'm still suffering from colds, I'll have to take one.
Ping made me feel like a dog.
It's a historical puzzle, but I took it for what it is.
One wrote, "It's a fantastic product."
Another commented: "It's a beautiful art that has been designed for the purpose of breastfeeding mothers (sometimes in their place of work or toilet) and "gay."
It's not a joke or a bad thing about this historic diary."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they were fighting against the guns that were placed in their chest.
It is based on the belief that many women who use the pump feel like songs.
The alvey pimp is completely calm, there is no star or turbulence and comes in peace within a nursing bridge, which allows women to escape, touch their children, and go out at any time.
Anna Balarine, Maad and her partner and Isidi commented: "The Alvey Pimp is an integral creation that was one of the most courageous and rare beginnings of all time.
In contrast to the songs of women and Dairy, we wanted to express it in a pleasant and perfect way, in which we also showed the wonderful sense of freedom given by the flag.
This is not the first time Alvey's pump has created secrets.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of a two-year-old child who was used to produce a cat appeared to be a designer Marta Jacuboski.
Hundreds of children were peacefully taken to a Texas Bard and a bomb camp.
The number of pregnant children captured is high, although the mass number of children who are breast - feeded by the Barder is increasing as a percentage of children who are breast-feeding, the harsh behaviors offered by the trunk management have made it difficult for children to give to users.
In a parallel way, most users themselves have come in a non-documentary way, and they fear that by claiming any child to be able to live in their own country, they will be able to stay in the country.
This increased in June, when joint authorities announced that potential users and other members of their families would have to offer fingerprints and this information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, a senator of Matthew Albens, Immigration and Customs Information, witnessed to Congress in front of evidence that the Agency had arrested a number of people who had been reluctant to use the Nabalgs.
The agency later claimed that there were no criminal records of the first eight-year-olds arrested.
"The people who are users or members of the user's home are legally staying here, and many of them are criminal.
So we're going to follow those people, "Shirman Albens says.
According to senior officials, the authorities have introduced new laws to speed up the child's processing, not after 18 days after their arrest, but within 10 months, they will have to be present in court.
Many people will present their case with an immigration court to receive legal recognition from the video conference, where they meet personally.
People who will be considered incapable of getting away with it will soon be expelled from the country.
According to reports of the past few months of forced labour and of the system, the more time children are kept in custody, the more likely there is to be anxiety or anxiety among them, the more they may be to try to hide their children from violence or to hide them from them.
Vakile says that concerns can be found in such a large area as Tornillo, where it is likely to be more sensitive to the signs of children's conflict.
They also said that if children do not have enough time to be emotionally prepared or to say goodbye to their friends, they can be supported by sending them to the town of Tent, where they are already very busy.
Syria told the United States, France and Turkey to quickly withdraw 'powers that'
Referring to the General Assembly, Foreign Minister Al-Molm also told Syria's officials to come home, although the country's war was now in the eighth year.
Mölm, who also works as the Supreme Minister, said that foreign forces, the forces of war with terrorism, Syria's land and illegal way of doing so, and "will be executed with him."
"They should be cut behind a condition immediately and without any conditions," he said to Asbelly.
Malm stressed that in Syria, "the war against terrorism is almost over," where more than half a million people have died since then and millions of people have destroyed their homes.
He said that Damascus "will continue to fight this Holy War until we are two terrorist groups" and "No other illegal foreigners will be present" from all parts of Syria.
In Syria, there are hundreds of thousands of U.S. soldiers who are teaching Kurdish soldiers against Al-Asad and the Syrian Arab chief and are counseling.
The country's land and France's war-consuming troops include more than a dozen troops.
In the presence of the authorities, Mahalm said that the situation had improved for their return, and he blamed "Some Western countries" for moving them to stay away from the authorities.
He said, "We have called international brotherhood and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns."
The one thing that must be completely humane is becoming political.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no restructuring aid for Syria until the political agreement to end the war between the ages and the periods of opposition is not reached.
The Union's experts say that in a recent debate between Russia and Turkey, there has been an opportunity to move forward with political dialogue by establishing an empty zone in the last main garden of Idlib.
This Russian-Turken soldier has been helped by the Russian army, which has helped Syria, which has led to a large-scale attack on the villages where there are 10 million people.
Malcolm stressed that the conflict was "a clear time limit" and hoped that this military action would serve as a signal to the armed forces of the Nursa Front, who "will be destroyed".
An angel staff of the Union hopes that soon the first call will be made by government and opposition members to prepare for Syria's post-war transition and prepare a way for elections.
Mahalm set up conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee and said that the panel's work would only be "recognizing the archives of the current situation" and any other entertainment.

As internal meetings have increased, North American and Central American authorities have been able to focus their attention on a long-term high-level conference on security and economic happiness, which was held last year in order to prevent immigrants from coming to America.

"It was a good thing for us because Willreal is a very good team," said the 31st-year-old.

We might eventually take it to ourselves, but maybe the drama was a negative result when we met.

Despite the fact that those who participated in the survey had a full picture of how they wanted to be saved, some people were still discussing it with their family members.
About half of the people in the city's study said they were talking to their wife about maintenance costs for a long time.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to look after them, but they're not taking any steps to talk about it," said the head of the Nassanid Life Insurance Business.
So let's start with this.
Talk to your family and children: If you don’t tell them your wishes, you can’t prepare to take care of your family in this way.
Think with your counselor and your family about where and how you want to find out where and how you want to find out what cost you are, because this is an important factor in making a connection.
Take your personal advice: Your counselor can also help you by telling you how to pay them.
In order to ensure long-term maintenance of a long-term illness, a temporary long-term illness may include a hybrid life-old disease policy that can either complete these costs or, until you have money, you can self-assess your life.
