Obama received Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly.
The two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and the destabilising measures in the Middle East.
However, it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two countries discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticises Israel's long-standing settlement building and promotes Netanyahu's lack of will in the peace process.
Through the deal that Obama had acquired about the Iranian nuclear program, the relationship between the two has deteriorated further.
In March Netanyahu had held a controversial debate at the invitation of the Republicans before the US Congress, which was partly considered to be against Obama.
The speech was not spoken with Obama, and a meeting with reference to the upcoming election in Israel had rejected it.
Professor is in a mood to have his friend shot
In a note, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his friend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his " Sweet Dog" was still alive and likely up, and he said that family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house the officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a written note that was critical of a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to do it back, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities' comments in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who, in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school area, where he had shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of his office.
Delta State University Polizechef Lynn Buford said University staff had heard the shooting at 10:18 p.m.
He said that Lamb once made the prison note.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamm took the life when the police cut him apart.
One day after the shooting at the university, the students and doctors are forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at the two ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who could observe, half of it, drew an image of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
The students said they enjoyed his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentis died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "miracle people" with which he shared his academic life.
Both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which includes 17 members, and many students attended courses by both.
At the same time, there were some allegations of problem behavior.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the Lamb, said that he seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously prayed to the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had a health problem.
In this year he taught only two online courses.
The latest changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion, which had worked so hard for the Lamb, would not provide him with an automatic guarantee for an appointment as assistant professor.
The University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lambs's idea."
These are questions that the Lamb can no longer answer.
After the flight from the campus, the police later found Lambs Spur when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun at the back of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still in the driveway.
It wasn't immediately clear why Ram went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogical.
He promoted it in Pádagogik in the spring.
One of the longtime friends Lambs named him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20, when she met a common friend.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to help her with the guitar game for years.
He was the woman's heat at the time.
All the girls get hurt when he's there," said Hearston, now 40 and in Jackson's capital city, Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the accident, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no chance of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the backstein house, which restricted them to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but friends remained and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about her daughter.
They and their mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played Blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were on a summer market three years ago.
Later they played together one or the other Gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes maintenance coordinator at The Jule Room, a weak-lighted bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5th, after Lamb had finished his guitar and Mundharmonics game before a scary audience.
There were no signs that something didn't agree.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were in the middle of a room and each other's arms.
I mean, they both had a good sense for jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student committee.
On Tuesday evening about 900 people, including doctors, employees, students and members of the community, participated in a church-lighted celebration.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the morning watch during the "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The training will be re-entered on Wednesday.
"We are trying to move our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contribute to this report.
This story was corrected to show that the police are now saying that Lamb made the accident after he shot Schmidt and that lamb in his accident named Prentiss, but there is no indication that both of them were ever married.
Toys R Us plant to set up less labour forces for Christmas time
Toys R tells Us that there are not as many Christmastime staff as in the last year, but the toys and baby products dealer says he will give the current employees and seasonal workers an opportunity to work more hours.
The company said it was planned to set up 40,000 people in towns and distribution centres throughout the country. In the spring of 2014, 45,000 workers were still employed.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it would start applications this month and the number of employees would increase from October to December.
While the holiday days are still away for months, the Christmas business comes closer, and companies are ready to set up time workers to enable rooms with employees to sell, send and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox laments his "date" with Princess Diana
The prize of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also noted for personal reasons.
"We are waiting in the theater for the Royals, and I note that the seat next to me is empty, and I will be quite clear that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a leading documentary "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it makes me feel like I'm a simulated walk and a long way away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentation on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lee Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with Director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had 30 years earlier.
"It's real for me," said Spielberg, "instrutfully the biggest time film ever driven."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there's no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia's strengthened military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the nearly five years of the conflict, and more weapons will only be used to bring violence and death to millions of people.
The UN Head once again calls on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to agree and to support in-depth negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - at the end of the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the savings in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional authorities "make this situation unsolved."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran in dealing with the crisis in Syria.
8 Infrared who show that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have abandoned him as a white man.
And some are waiting for a break.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the upper range of questions down there, it has not (not yet) worked.
Ten of the last 11 national surveys were conducted in the second area, and some began to question seriously what it meant for the possibility of appointing the property mogul.
Of course it's too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was given to the rising Herman Cain, not only one of whom won a state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have fought in a general election.
But foreign groups such as Jeb Bush Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trumps' ability to survive and start to fly their dollar to control it.
Here are some current infraggerates that mean that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values are 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, a survey by Monmouth University showed that only two of the ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
Until mid-July there were 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 per cent.
Six of the 10 Republicans now have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are kept in early states.
A Quinnipic poll in Iowa last week found that 60 per cent of the Republicans had a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters will be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said they would either be "satisfied" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Just two out of 10 say they'd be "crazed" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same desire as Trump (43 percent say they would be "depressed" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next one in matters of interest?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters say they would be "unsatisfied" or "depressed" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of the Republicans do not see Trump's temperature as a problem.
While Donald Trump is criticised for his bombistic and misleading statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tending to the Republican voters believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperature for a president, ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-election country of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 per cent of Republicans think he has the personality of a superintendent, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his office, and almost six of 10 independents say that his temperature does not fit into a white house, so ABC/Post.
Republican voters are accustomed to the idea.
If they set up their scholarships, Republican voters think that Trump is real.
If they are asked who won the GOP nomination for the first time, after a CNN/ORC survey last week, four out of ten said that Trump was the best law.
This is a change since the time when four of the ten-year-olds placed their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete explanation: GOP voters in the past did not have the clearest crystal ball.
At this time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination only 28% for the final candidates Mitt Romney.
However, it is shown that a number of GOP voters consider Trumps Campaign to be plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the split field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-trump support is distributed to more than a thousand other candidates diffusion.
But a survey by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-and-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump deserves majority support.
He has 13 points in front of Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio 14 points in front of Walker 15 points in front of Jeb Bush 19 points in front of Rand Paul, John Kasach and Chris Christie 33.
It's a head-on-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who hit him?
Ben Carson would occupy the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-and-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support the trumpet say they have passed their votes firmly.
Of course, many can happen to change this, and no one can really say that never change the opinion.
46 percent said they let the door open to change to other candidates.
However, Trumps is the strongest competition at the time of the other external site, the neurosurgery Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump, in his election campaign two months ago, called immigrants from Mexico "survival", the immigration was a turning point in the public talk in 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombistic expression of Trump will be taken away by the Republican party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post poll from Monday, six out of 10 Republicans said that they agreed with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the framelight, it will seem that Donald Trump will do the same.
The frustration over the government focuses on new heights.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson, however, about half of the support from Republican voters, especially by their external status, falls.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new ABC/Post poll, they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also on Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three of four Iowa Republicans were frustrated with the Republicans at the Congress, with 54% "unsatisfied" and 21% "all-intensibly frustrated".
München, Sylt and Co.: The five exclusive residential areas of Germany
Here on Hobookenway is the most expensive accommodation - looking at the North Sea.
On the road, a square meter of a reetdach house costs €73,300.
"On Sylt, the offer is limited by nature," says the study - so the high price.
A new study shows which special layers cost a square meter most.
Of course, €18.70 per square metre for a student offer in Munich are not really small.
In contrast to Germany's Top Towns, one of the prices is like Peanuts.
The real estate servicer Angel & Peoples has published a list of the most exclusive German housing sites - with square metres prices in speed-related heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros - per square metre, well-known.
But it's good who can afford it...
Other: Munich is not here except at the top.
Champions League: Bayern-Triumstart thanks Müller and Götze
Two-fold torch protection in Piréus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller has just one run.
A happy encounter by Thomas Müller opened the way for the FC Bayern to a worthy 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then loved us.
A sovereign mission of the Champions League season.
World Master Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have protected the FC Bayern in the Hexenkessel of Piréus in the "Mission Mailland".
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won its performance at the Championships League at the Greek recordmaster Olympics in the hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's Double Pack (52/90.+2) and God's match (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The 12th lead in series is to be the first step towards Finale on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to take the anchorpot to Munich at the third stage.
At his 28th meeting, Müller received the valuable help of Olympikas Tovart Roberto, who took over an exhibition thought to be by the World Master's Championships League.
"We won't underestimate them," said Captain Philipp Lahm before the game at the Karaskakis Stadium before 31.688 hot-blooded fans - and the Münchner kept his word.
They showed a concentrated and committed presentation without glazing.
Piraeus had won his most recent six home games in the King's class, including against popular clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
2011 also took place here in Borussia Dortmund (1:3).
However, the Bayerns, who did not visit seven European cups with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They bravely went to work in their offensive efforts, but often too easily.
The attacks were too often launched by game degradation on the left side of Douglas Costa, who rarely passed against the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck than his flange from the right half field in the upper left tower.
In the 67th minute the world master gave the possible 2:0.
The best opportunities in half were Robert Lewandowski.
First, as the Olympic champion Ideye Brown beat the Polish headball off the line (26).
Then by direct adoption, the Tovart Roberto paired with the knife (35).
Although the Bayerns used to play a dominant game, Pirous could put Christmas sticks.
However, Manuel Neuer was released on Torhüter.
So it's like he tied an Ideye shot over the latte (56).
In front of the news, Guardiola left a four-pack with David Alabama in the center near Jerome Boating, which did well.
Mario Götze, after muscle problems, comes back into the frame, first out.
The WM-Held gave green light only after the completion of the training, sports president Matthias Sammer at "Sky" said: "Whoever wants to do something else, that's already bad."
On the first exchange, Guardiola also decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman to the accused Lewandowski (59).
Götze later came for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by Elfmeter, Müller set another turn.
Before the game, it came to Krawall in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially amused Bayern fans in their watch-block, it was evident that the guests of Piraeus had caused words and gestures to attack the security forces and went forward with blows against the Münchner hangers.
At least a Bayern fan was transported from the stadium.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth
Whoever smokes, harms not only the lung but also the teeth - it draws a Potsdamer long-term study.
The good news: The risk is quickly reduced.
Smokers have a very high risk of losing their teeth early.
This is from a long-term study of an international research team, including several staff of the German Institute for Food Research (DIFE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smoking smokers, there was a risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.5- to 3.6-phase.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are the careers and dispersions of the teeth, stressing the DIE.
For this parodontitis smoking is a risk factor, the authors point out.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss therefore leads to more frequent tooth loss in smokers.
It is not clear how smoking also increases the risk for careers.
People who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, writes researchers in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it may take more than ten years until the threat is again reduced to the level of non-smoking, Professor Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham.
People need to be convinced not to become smokers, study director Heiner Boeing of the DIE said: "Smoking shortens life."
Not to smoke is good for long and fat and also leads to good dental health until high age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DIFE shared.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long - term study subsidizes the findings.
Archeologists stopped at Colner Rheinuffer on the rest of the lateral
For the time being, archaeological funds have been set up at the right of Rheinufer in Cologne.
Close to the building for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German Museum have uncovered Skelette and other historical buildings, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work at Rhein, historians have been looking for so-called land miners.
For all construction projects in the city district Koln the museum is always referred to as a specialist in archaeological land management.
In the third construction section of the Rhineboulevard, archaeologists were now five.
It has already been known from texts that during the 4th century, a fortress and a church existed in the 8th century, explained Trier.
In addition to the rest of the fortress and the church tower, a peace hall with about 350 graves was also discovered, which was probably part of the church.
Young woman of good practice
After a young woman at the train station in Geilenkirchen Lindern has been unhappy, the federal police are asking the people for help.
Early Wednesday morning at 1.40 p.m., the woman from the direction of the railway station came across the bridge at the end of the train stop and was picked up by a train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By taking the train, she has caused serious damage to it according to the Federal Police.
She was treated in a local manner and was taken to a hospital by rescue forces.
On the basis of the young woman's nightly traffic, there are no findings from the officials concerned.
The event may have been observed by witnesses or residents have taken acoustic warnings.
Question comes from residents or passengers from Linderner Road, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Lifefarther Street (L364).
Comments given about the cause of the accident may be given around the clock and free hotline of the federal police under telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police station.
EU Commission proposes a new TTIP court in dispute
In order to resolve the dispute on the proposed TTIP Free Trade Agreement, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current judicial system.
The contested private clearing arrangements for disputes between groups and states should therefore be resolved by a more transparent system, which clearly reflects more traditional courts in its functioning.
"We want to establish a system that trusts the citizens," said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
Sweden has proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in free trade negotiations with the United States.
The German Government announced its support.
Through TTIP, the world's largest free trade zone will be created with 800 million people.
The plans for the reform of the current judgment procedure provide for the EU and the United States to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They should be of the same origin from the EU, the United States and third countries.
A second instance is also foreseen for the first time.
She would allow it to challenge judgments.
Until then, the parties to the proceedings agreed on a case-by-case basis, there was no objection to their judgment.
In the discussion last month, it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDN system in matters of fairness and justice, commented on the malt stream.
In the long term, they want to work on their own data at an international investment court.
For example, there could also be disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries.
In particular, the investor-state arbitration (ISDS) required by large companies is one of the main reasons for the great opposition to TTIP in Europe.
The traditional courts are criticised by geniuses as a kind of parallelistism, the companies are liable to impose damages on taxable persons, the laws of national law may be repealed or a reduction in consumer and environmental standards may be applied.
In the first opinion, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact considered the EU Commission's proposals insufficient.
In particular, it was criticised that it should not apply to the free trade agreements already negotiated with Canada (Ceta).
The German State Secretary for Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as a major step forward.
The Commission takes into account the important points drawn up by Federal Minister of Economy Sigmar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private disciplines is from the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European business association Europe warned against limiting the complaints of the economy through many new rules.
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises could be expected to do so, he said.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, it remains unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been under way since mid-2013.
The issue of investment protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
A framework for the agreement should originally be at the end of this year.
This term is no longer valid.
Delicate People of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago Sufjan Stevens is sitting on the stage in the Colner Prime Club (now Luxor).
In addition to him is a flashcard on which the most effective folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state Michigan with a filmboard.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost caught by Steven's speech.
He tells us about various places that he always signs on the map, where his minimizing and well-organized songs are reported.
Where they came from and how they look there, in his home.
Then Stevens is described as a wonderful creative Irish.
With the 2003 release and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" music appears well composed songs that are very harmonizingly close to the American people of the late six-years, but can run into great opulent.
There is the smell, "Michigan" would be the first part of a series: each of the 50 US states would be affected by it.
However, since 2004 and in Rheinhe it has already appeared "Seven Swans" and has given some positive expectations.
Reduce Stevens' presence here.
Live enough guitar for him and Banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinois"), 2005 appears to be an outstanding masterpiece.
Overboard with ideas and stylistic fines.
The album grows into the American Billboard Charts and is missing in no annual list of influential music media.
After over-productive experiments Stevens then works on "The Age of Adz" (2001) very extensive electronic replacements.
This sixth regular studio album is still orchestrated widely, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and halls.
As long as the smaller clubs are up, the stage shows here will be a beautiful spectacle of the Neon Star Bands and a large fluorescent pool endico.
Sufjan Stevens is currently visiting as part of a five-headed band by Germany.
In the darkness of Hamburger More!
Theater is mainly presenting the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs, the well-known Stevens return to privacy and to the people.
Without saying a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the wide-ranging album.
From the audience you hear: the talk is "opulent" and it allows you to "reject the plate on the ground".
First thanks to a presentation Stevens gets angry, plays a few older songs acoustically and finally relaxes under the current appeal.
Jeremy Corbyn's Debüt at the Prime Minister's question hour
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's Debüt is expected to be late at the Prime Minister's hour of question.
The new Labour President, Jeremy Corbyn, will give his debut at the Prime Minister's question hour and will be with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will raise himself to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, where his performance is likely to be checked by the media and the laboratory staff from nearby.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip some meetings to leave his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyns, because it will come after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour President to celebrate a 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in Stille during the National Hymne's singing on Tuesday, has led to criticism by a number of Tory MPs and stands at the centre of several titles stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national hymn drew attention to himself
A speaker from Mr. Corbyn said that he had "standing in a respectful manner" and had recognized the "Hence of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's Schatenkabinett, Owen Smith, told BBC Two Newsnight Program that he had told the Labour President to sing the national hymn "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, and they are calling for differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The BBC correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stopping" within the work and that, according to Mr Corbyn's advice on position for the European Union and the limit on winning.
Mr Corbyn said the TUC conference that the Labour Conference had made changes in order to remove the whole idea of a restriction as a whole.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow and pension minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of $26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour President, David Cameron, since he's the chief of Tory, has been on his way across the Dispatch Box in Parliament in the last decade.
The Labour President, who has promised another policy base, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions with Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 recommendations.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's hour of question is too confrontational, and that he will be left with both "fragility" and the conflict with relapses and instead has committed himself to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle will be represented by the shadow Minister of Economy if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is away abroad.
He also introduced the idea that other colleagues would take the floor from time to time, and that he had spoken to John Bercow, the speaker of the basement, to discuss the problem.
When he was led in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to get rid of politics in the style of a "Kasperle Theatre", which is often linked to the Prime Minister's hour of question. But a few years later, he said that he had failed to do so.
Since she was first posted on television in 1990, the hour of question with the Prime Minister was viewed as the most important barometer of a leader's trial and his leadership in the home and his position under his fellow Members of Parliament, although critics argued that she had become a cartoonist and needed further reforms.
'Geschosen in Joburg': Obdakhlose Young People trained for photographers
The city center of Johannesburg is a quiet place where you are blind.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and earn their livelihood.
"I what shot in Joburg" (I was in Joburg ge(er-)schossen) is a joint studio that teaches blind young people how they take photos from their environment and achieve a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Fund increases by rapid wage growth in the United Kingdom
The fund rose rapidly after data showing an increase in the United Kingdom's wage growth. At the same time, FTSE 100 was increased by SAB Miller's offer target.
Between May and July the result without Boni increased by 2.9% in the United Kingdom compared with the same period of previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest and most reliable estimate since 2009.
The money rose by more than 1% against the dollar at $1.5505 and was raised by 0.84% against the euro at $1.3730.
The FTSE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1,49 % to 6,229,21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20% jump after the acquisition offer of the Rivalen AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest brewers of the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0,9 % higher after encouraging reports from the Competition Group for Luxury Credits.
Richemont's latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - re-reported growth.
The share of Glencore rose by 5% after the mountain-bauriese said that it had taken $2.5 billion through a sale of shares as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper company Mondi were the biggest losses on the index, although with a decrease of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs had put his assessment for the company rating to "selling".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sport clothing company reported a tax result of 46.6 million per year.
The chief of JD Sports said higher wages threatened expansion.
JD Sports Director Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will equal the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD sports, he added, and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Läppische 21 years old, a deal with overheating freshness.
The type with the platinum hair is 100 million euros hard.
Even more.
Mr Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And generation U17 runs through.
Like Victoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton."
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin last night.
Among them are Eva and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the police are sitting on the cold stone plates in the form of Berliner luxury hotel at Potsdamer Square.
The Bieber-Builder: Here you live your idol, whose posters have been hanging in Stettin since Monday evening.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer lives, costs as much as her mother Eve deserves in half a year.
If at all.
He says, "In fact, my Victoria had to sit in the 10th grade in Gymnasium."
"I fill you with a dream."
School duty?
Who's Juckt's?
The guys aren't.
Not even Bieber himself.
He's been out there without it.
For advertising in the Superbowl's advertising season, he cast three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickle company, spent many, many dollars on a beer account.
And for every doll that looks like him and over the ladentic, beeber also casts.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you'll be on the window.
More than 100 million he's supposed to have.
Some say the hipe went too far.
Others point out that Bibber was finally in the United States and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" on page 1.
Byeber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, the many zeros are not interested for the first time.
At least you do.
Pegida-Plakat brings Lebanon to the idea of cardboard
Cardioflage or donner?
It is both - and although it is in the cardboard shop developed by the Oldburg Imbis owner Hani Alay.
Inspired by the speech "Carthofel instead of Döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alay Kartofel and meat have gathered together to a meal.
On the idea, he was given a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the title "Carthofeln instead of Duner", which he had seen on television.
Since then, there has been a grill spade with meat and potatoes.
"This is a multiculti for the stomach," says Alay.
The idea has allowed itself to enter Lebanese between the patent office in Munich.
There she has been protected as a model of use, as stated by the authorities.
As much meat and how many potatoes of the meal contain, Allaha does not want to be forgotten.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary people's understanding also comes well with its customers.
Metcash launchs groundhandling campaign to combat Aldi attacks
Metcash tries to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi aufmarsch in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a groundhandling campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in the face of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing for the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 rooms in South Australia and Western Australia in the early years, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brands through Mainstream marketing and marketing on social media, as well as on events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as Eisherseller Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA countries and shop owners who sell valid tickets for the South Australian footballga to trusted customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the major food, alcohol and equipment dealer performs its annual investor strategy day.
It is very much on the game as South Australia and Western Australia generate almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA load business and generate higher profits than Metcash's IGA network in the East.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorious provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the East.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will be eliminated about five per cent of the food market in these two countries and all existing players, but mainly individual dealers, will be removed.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will achieve a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss of food and food business and the amount on Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million for profits and taxes, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the East states, mainly with Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan revealed that IGA buyers are the most reliable.
Morgan Stanley notes that Metcash's consumption in food and food business will fall by 3.1 per cent in 2016 in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 and will reduce market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week the lead fund manager Hamish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglas's comments.
But it will be concluded that a member of Metcash contacted Mr Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has decreased from 18 per cent to 14 per cent, and income from Metcash's food and food trade, which provides about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the operational debt burden on sales and margins at the same time.
However, the wholesaler becomes and invests more than $150 million to compare sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products each week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their villages by faster growing fresh food and better choice of private label food.
Metcash's chief business manager Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and charging programmes will be applied to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Verband Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism of his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collator damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves to be praised by the president of the Australian tennis band Steve Healy rather than critical of his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, who is younger than the talented duo, which is always referred to as "Special Ks", is led by the famous replacement of Kyrugios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters in the framelight.
In a fire-qualification game in Cincinnati soon thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the judge, where Harrison wrote: "Wawrinka had to beat Kyrgyzstan, and I should have killed the child."
While he was last seen how he hit a tennis player after a cracking up a potential U.S. opening victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis of Healy was permanently defended.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in the competition with Sam Groth about the second place behind Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup semifinals against Britain.
"One thing I'm quite concerned about is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi was a little involved in the conflict," said Healy.
He broke a fighter when he lost because of a strike in the U.S. Open, but he's not the first player who broke a fighter out of fur with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has been extremely good in the US-open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a big family around him, and I think he's been treated a little bit badly.
He is a very proud 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the area of clothing, he is trained hard, he is well in shape, he is a very stable and well-educated young man, and I believe he deserves to be judged according to his own services.
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account the important decision which begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right decision for all, but he ensures that the man from Canberra is able to return to the team as a longer-term strong component."
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgyos]," said Healy.
And I think Nick has made the rise very fast, where people like Federers and Murray have shown him. He's gone up in the eyes of the public, and he's made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside of the framelight, where he can only think about it, I think it's the best for humanity and it's the best for him.
European refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and arranged the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and stopped all those who tried to come into the country illegally. Everything with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants.
Chaos followed the border, as hundreds of migrants gathered in a non-member country and Serbian officials responded with emulation.
The people who had fled in the face of violence spent an unknown time in a rural section of the street between the two control points of the countries, fixed and built cells and dropped down there.
But the frustrations increased.
As a police officer pushed over them, the migrants were scanning "Opens the border!" and shouting accusations against Hungarian police.
Some show from Protestant food and water back.
Serbia's Foreign Minister stated that it would be "unacceptable", that migrants would be sent back from Hungary, while more and more came from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There will be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turbulence at the Hungarian-Serbian border arrived one day after the 28-nation block at a strategic meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy.
However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking asylum in cross-border Italy and Greece. They expressed their hope that, at the end of the next month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would take another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit on Tuesday in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.
However, Hungary did not set its hopes on a valid action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, so that they could stop the streets and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country also planned to build a steel plant along its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants across the country - after it ended a tsunami at the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were used during the course of the course to create the Stacheldraht-Zun between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major haven for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and to the point of entry into the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has pointed out that most of the arriving economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who claim protection - a view which is strongly opposed to other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws that take effect at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4-metre (13 feet) high
"Because of the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian Government explains the state of need," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament must agree with the use of the military technique expected for the next week, but reporters of Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for a long time.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country security consultant for Orban, said that the authorities were 45 people in an attempt to cross the border, 15 others were already deeply involved in the country.
They come up by harming the Zaun, they are now in police custody and are charged with the commission of penalties under the new laws.
The authorities are quick to repair the damage.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border hotels with Serbia on Tuesday, after a train with steel rod to close the border.
Chaos turned the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process data from people and press a number of people to enter.
About 20 came in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important road link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they could travel to Hungary.
Select-2016: Hillary Clinton's origin before Bernie Sanders in national survey
Former U.S. Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double lead in the democratic race for nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins it against ground.
Clinton now supports 47% of the democratic voters in the election (58% before), while Sanders is in second place, with 27% (increased by 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is applying for the presidential office, receives 15 per cent of the democratic voters' support.
More than five months before the start of the elections, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more persistent in their choice than the other candidates.
Since the CBS-News survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has achieved some gains.
Clinton holds a great advantage in women and co-workers, but these priorities have decreased.
Her support for the men is clearly low, and Sanders is only here with 5 points back.
Clinton's advantage for democratic voters has been refugees for less than 50 years, and they and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, has another great advantage in the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with double origin in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point origin in this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the elections in the country say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party.
One quarter would support them with some reservations and 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
It may not be surprising that Clinton's current supporters are particularly interested in her.
The views are more mixed with those who do not support Clinton today - only about a quarter of them would like to support it.
While 48 per cent of the democratic voters of the elections say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become a president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
By Clinton's supporters, their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent) is also mentioned.
Allowance to deal with the problems and the availability of options is also cited.
Since the Vice-President puts a potential for the President-in-Office into the Waagschale, 57% of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not.
If democratic voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, prayer is at the top.
More than half of Clinton's supporters said that their second choice would be far from Sanders.
If you decide not to apply for the appointment of the Democrats, Hillary Clintons will increase its origin before Sanders, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him running.
Fifty-five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the election; however, this number has declined by 78 percent in the last month.
Prayer is a second time at this measurement, but the percentage considered to be the "chosenest" has increased.
However, when it comes to the question of what is more important for a candidate, democratic voters call questions on the availability of elections.
As in the last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these choices is considered unacceptable.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates will produce good results in some important features of their party's choices.
Most of us consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and reliable and with strong driving qualities.
Please cut off the three candidates best at honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and reliable, so many say it about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not think so.
Democratic voters of the choices are generally seen in the same way as Clinton, Sanders and Biden in their views.
At all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no idea of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are continued as an external minister during the official period, most democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their views at all.
But it's another story in the U.S. public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about one third are satisfied.
The public opinion on this was in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general views of Clinton, although 36 percent said that they still felt bad about it.
They are mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10 who say that their views have become worse by Clinton.
Although Clinton is considered honest and reliable by the voters of her party, this is still a problem for them under the elected voters as a whole: only 32% see them as honest and reliable, eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May.
62% of the voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55% of voters in the country view Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump receive good notes when driving.
Of the six tested candidates, they cut their prayers, Carson, and Bush best at honesty.
Most people look more honest than Sanders, but like Carson, many don't think about him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the selection is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson returns to a country-wide survey near Donald Trump
Ben Carson is at the latest CBS News/New York Times close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates fall between half of the electoral support in the new survey, and others lose dramatically
Republican voters continue to support a large number of troops throughout the country. The aid increases by 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News's debate last month, by 27% in the survey on Tuesday.
But Carson dropped from 6% to 23% at the same time.
The survey also showed that Carson is well-educated in demographic groups and that he is overprivileged by Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasach, has been destroyed with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen most deeply, although of 10% support in the last month is 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are 6% in third place.
The error margin in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC questionnaire published last week shows that Carson is increasing in the questionnaires - he will receive 19% support from the Republicans after the summit with 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump was clearly in front of Carson.
With a look at Carson rising last week, Trump found some side effects for the former neurosurgeons, even after Carson decided to question Trump's beliefs.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign event in Iowa.
Acceptable bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is up to 29 degrees Fahrenheit [29 ° C].
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, it is enough for bathers already a trip to the Mediterranean to find more hot water.
A swimming pool in the north or east of the lake should be a rather short fun at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some no longer go to the sea: Maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and East Sea this week, sharing the German weather service (DWD).
On the other hand, bathing temperatures continue to increase: In the east they reach up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes at 28 degrees.
Five members of the fraternity with the death of a Baruch College-Neulings
Nearly two years after the death of a student during a professional ritual of a student's association in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, a death is reported against five persons.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi-Bruderschaft Chun "Michael" Deng took his transport to the hospital which contributed to his death in September 2013 to the police.
Officials said he was loaded with connected eyes with a 30-pound back bag full of sand and was repeatedly attacked while he tried to cross a frozen field to a target.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, and then he became unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta Psi brotherhood did not call 911 after deng became ill and apparently waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, so the police.
However, they had the time to change deng's clothes to swallow his symptoms and Andy Meng, to contact the national presidents of the fraternity, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point the members began to hide their tools and put the welfare of the brotherhood basically over what Michael Deng said," said the police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning at his injuries.
After an autopsy report, deng was repeatedly added with stupor force injuries to the head, hip and upper arm.
"At least one student dies every year from the Schikanes since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng's family in a statement.
Brothers and their members must be taken into account, and this step by the authorities is very important.
A County Grand jury of Monroe recommends a third grade charge for murder for the first five members.
Twenty-three members of the fraternity, including Mr Meng, are also accused of deliberate attacks and the formation of a criminal union.
"We not only want to take responsibility for the persons involved, but if there is an organization that has officially or informally penalized this, we will also take them to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has rejected its membership in the local group.
This will happen when the fever increases the interest
An increase of interest will occur, and the house will be thrown into shops, loans will be raised, and the economy will be driven into a recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will last.
In particular, the history of the economy offers only little guidance on running.
A recession came within 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, although not always, a factor in how the economy and financial institutions react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed that investors should not focus on this when they start to raise interest rates but rather on the time needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end, however, market participants could determine that the whole rise was likely to be exceeded due to an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase in the fed since the global financial crisis is inevitably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "serious money," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the overall return of US interest to normal heights, but still to a low level, to lead to seismic shock, to appear to fear many.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no effects.
Here is a historical trend based on how some areas of the economy might react:
As the market has seen in the last month, the rise in interest rates can make things more volatile for a long time.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There appears to be a tendency to cancel assets from 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again," German bank analysts said in a new study on what happens after interest increases in the fed.
It is said that in the past 35 years, the market has been mostly on its way to the rise of interest, slightly flat within 250 days (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal status after 500 days, with an average income in the previous six cycles of 14.4 percent according to an actual analysis published by Bob Doll, Chief Plant Strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The German Bank said that the effects on the shares were trending later in the growth cycle and that incomes began to decrease.
Reactions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases are often encouraging.
In the present case, the liver is faced with certain conditions which were not previously available and which could speed up a recession.
It is particularly important to note that the gross domestic product near its lowest point will be at a interest rate increase in feed.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 interest increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was under 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, only a few expected this to last and are expected for the third quarter following the data of the Atlantic Fed only 1.5 per cent.
Price increases in such a fragile economic cycle could be risky and raise the question, "Is it different this time," said the German Bank.
Market participants have been making an increase in the interest rate throughout the year, and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategies and economies believe that the FOMC could allow for an increase in this session, the future-handling is only a 25 per cent probability.
"In our study, all the rise cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super-cycle with increasing momentum at the GDP and put pre-regression levels in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery," says the report.
On the contrary, this is a clear slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is the longest that the feed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is up to 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile as the market took a interest rate increase, and the pattern is relatively similar to that on the capital market.
The main difference is that the impact on loans is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course.
When borrowing, the incomes seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase/saving takes place in the cycle.
At the end of the growing cycle, the lessor fell immediately, the German bank said.
The strategies of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer combination of income between longer and shorter loans and lead to a downturn of the curve.
High-risk loans often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher returns", said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to feed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the view of stricter monetary policies," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the profit curve is flexible, credit savings have increased and the volatility has increased - all features of the market when the feds are boosting their strategy.
In the larger and larger sectors, companies that distort most of their business activity in the United States will benefit from increasing interest rates and attract local products.
Multinational companies with high debt will become worse because a dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market as well as the financing of their debts.
"The story shows that "Quality" shares tend to respond positively three months after an initial increase of interest," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to the customers.
Firms with a strong balance-of-balance sheet have over 5 percentage points per company with a weak balance after each increase in interest rates 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital income as well as low volatility in their shares also exceed their low-quality pendants by average of 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent points).
Debt will be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most of them," Goldman said.
In addition to the clean stock games, consumers are also benefiting from the growing dollar.
savings could be seen through higher earnings, even if experts have different opinions as soon as possible.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says Parliamentary Member Andrew Bingham.
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the sender for his "injury"
He argues that it is not to differ increasingly from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitation The Brits.
Parliament's colleague Damien Collins seized The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the sender to prove that he does something that private agents don't do.
Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public-law broadcasters are "damaged" and are increasingly no longer different from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "redummen" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards that started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be only under another name.
So if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
BBC Director-General showed the drafts back and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public disclosure.
What I learn from Radio 3, I'll learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there's a commitment to live music and music that's really inexhaustible.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to give new works in order, I also feel really important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it was more difficult to engage the public than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production, however, which, during the hearing of the Committee on the Election of Culture, Media and Sport, was used to bring commercial rivals into the foot.
The tour director Damien Collins seized The Voice - the music talent show of the BBC, which was purchased by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of £22 million.
See why this program is often discussed because it is not original and is not particularly marked?
Lord Hall noted that the BBC 1-show - with Palma Faith and Boy George as the judge - was produced "in a special BBC way".
He added that he wanted the company to "find a heat from our domestic steel" when it next started a maintenance series.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to issue money from the taxpayer for other maintenance formats.
Internet transfers increase in August at the latest and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
In the first three months of 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the census in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using phones to buy
Experts believe that the Black Friday broke out in November
For over a decade, virtual purchases have grown, and many of the main shopping streets in Britain have turned into spirit cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs that online replacements are stagnant after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the census in 2000 with only five per cent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnant after new numbers only seven percent growth in the first three months 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, then this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, publisher of the IMRG Sales Index to the Guardian.
He stated that online sales increased three years ago as buyers to engage in their mobile purchases.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now this is about to happen, and we may experience that growth decreases.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America will be cited as a reason for the following changes.
Experts believe that buyers will resume their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
In the past year, the average number of buyers was five times the average number of purchasers for their computers to make their shoes, and some dealer websites were blocked.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where the buyers fought because of snowflakes, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study of the British Retail Consortium found that of 5 £ expenditure was slightly more than 1 £ online.
In some products such as television and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now carried out via Webshops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of the people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those in Mekka at the Kran accident killed - Bin Laden's family is penalized
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mekka by the streets
Saudi Arabia is part of the huge Saudi bin-laden group for the burden
The Ministry of Health said that 394 people were also injured in total after the cancer hit
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were taken by the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane rushed to Mekkas Großmoschee.
Tragically, dressed widely in white, the streets were filled with respect when the first of the dead took their last trip to Al-Moaisme Peaceport.
The mourning process went to the Holy Place, where only days earlier a baukran had flown through the roof of the mosque and then poured it on the bedside.
The bodies were released for execution when the Saudi King imposed a fine on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 wells who were killed when a crane was hit by the Great Central Mosquee Mekkas were taken by the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage to the Krana.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual hat in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already said that the Haddsch to Mekka with thousands of people who will still come to town will continue.
Today King Salman, the bin-laden group, said that he should not leave the arm of the Kran until he was used.
An Arabic version of the decree published by the Saudi Press Agency said the bin charge group was responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's management of foreign travel was prohibited.
At the beginning of this week, Salman was able to understand what caused the chaos of the Krans, which swept into an inner courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Haddsch, which took place later this month.
The Bin-Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the Krans and its representatives are not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also defeated the group because of non-current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Thousands of brains around Mekkas Großmoschee are part of the massive construction project led by the bin-load group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the Governing Council of Saudi Arabia for decades and has taken on larger construction projects.
The dead leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a retired son who was adopted by the family in the 1990s.
The outbreak of the cancer came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is necessary at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remained in the hospital.
Government representatives agreed that 1 million Rial (£174,000) are to be paid to the members of the deaths and the same amount of permanent damage.
Other losses receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of the cheap oeste European handworkers is over
Britons work increasingly handworkers, says Veronica Lauri
The number of qualified manual workers from Eastern Europe has increased behind
This leads to the opening of 200 more Screwfix layers that are aimed at manual workers.
At the same time, Kingfisher 60 B&Q will be closed countrywide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British lower their doors and pins in favour of the use of qualified oeste European handworkers who carry out their work in their home
If you can walk around with a hammer or a brush to push walls, today you seem to belong to a minority.
Because Britain employs increasing manual workers to carry out homework in their homes, as the company's boss behind B&Q.
Vérónique Lauri, new business leader of Kingfisher, who owns the market chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at deep price has been observed.
Kingfisher therefore plans to open 200 more Screwfix Shops, which are directed to manual workers and close 60 B&Q sales stations.
Mrs. Lauri said she wanted to hire more women in B & Q shops, as eight out of ten purchase decisions were made in the cargo by women.
At the moment, the staff are taking over the men.
She said it would be necessary to put in place the growing demographic trend that shows more women's single households that take more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Lauri said: "There's still a lot of men working in our branches.
We need to move this closer to a balance.
Basically, half of our customers from women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a large role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Lauri, who is one of only five women at the top of a British company listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also redesigned her top team to reflect a similar number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has nearly 50 percent of the team working with women, including its business management and financial standing.
Mrs. Lauri said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a fall in the middle of the year and the transfers after the group covered the cost of closing the villages.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officers of Aich/Dob for trust before court
On Wednesday at the Landsgericht Klagenfurt, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vizimeister Aich/Dob must be responsible for trust and accountability.
The defendants were not known to be guilty.
One of them was also accused of abuse of office.
In May he was legally released.
The current process has been cancelled.
According to U.S. attorney Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, the complainants used United accounts money for private purposes during the years 2006 to 2011.
The damage is about 400,000 euros.
Sports operators are also accused of financial fraud.
This fact was decided by the President of the creation agency, Mr Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later date.
To deny trust, the defence showed that the association had not at any time been a part of its assets.
The sports operators had calculated only claims and the sport club for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and had invested much time and money in the debt - the liabilities were about 600,000 Schilling in 2001 (€44,000).
"At that time we were facing the situation: are we taking the club further or are we stopping?" said one of the defendants, who was the chief executive officer of the financial department.
He then decided to take up this task with his colleagues and his colleagues.
With all the risks.
"We have proposed money, our life insurance as security at the bank," he said at the adoption.
The Union was agreed: you can manage the money freely, it must not be made for any debts.
Furthermore, in the case of appropriate financial support, the recovery of the damages was recognizable until 1991.
That is why part of the reimbursements were paid only years later, i.e. since 2003, when a plus was on the account.
Therefore, there were also pauschal and non-detailage records, the former Ombudsman explained the facts.
The accounts and savings books managed the two complainants together, said the second complainant.
Why the payments to the Union were not detailed, the Richterin asked.
The Union has not been interested in the details of the financial guarantee, it is important that it was only the freedom of the debt, so the answer.
In 2011, a amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the Union account.
The complainants declared it to be their records.
This securities account liked the name of the second defendant and was not known according to his statement to the Union.
"Why?" asked the rich man.
The interviewer had no answer for this.
Then he finally meant that he believed this was the best for the union.
If something happened to him, no one knew anything about this money, the state attorney put it in the room.
The suspect was informed, the officer rectified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "dangerous recovery".
Why damage?, the Richter wanted to know.
The first complainant stated that he had not agreed with this formulation because the company had never suffered damage.
But what am I supposed to do when the lawyer says, "With whom are you all out of the snow?"
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he had never touched a cent, he had only a mile of money and diet.
On diets, he took into account the unit of 1,000 euros per month, but the actual increase was much higher, he added.
The complainants could not provide specific details for the previous years.
These were no longer kept after an operation test that was correctly assessed, they declared.
The second complaint was also related to a kilometre of money.
All claims were made in bar so that he had to travel from his residence to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main proceedings will continue on 23 September with the question of witnesses.
Hewlett Packard stretchs more 30,000 jobs
In addition to the three-year staffing process, computer power will continue to operate at the start of the company.
The position lines on the US computer series Hewlett Packard (HP) do not end.
The US-Technology Group is planning to build from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate partners as part of its restructuring.
This should cover costs of $2.7 billion (EUR 2.4 billion), which the company shared on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special charge of about 2.7 billion dollars, which will fall from the fourth quarter.
The ongoing three years of job creation of 55,000 jobs has not yet been completed.
HP employed about 302,000 employees at the end of the business year 2013/14.
The Hewlett Packard action was 2.3 per cent after birth.
The largest group with printers from the California Palo Alto is now on the ground: this is how computer and printer business is to be merged into a new company - in contrast with the most powerful areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both business shares should be recorded on the stock exchange.
A resuscitating PC setback as well as a weaker demand from company customers for its services put the world's second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo.
In the third business quarter at the end of July, the paragraph of PC and printers returned to 11.5 per cent.
The turnover fell by 8 percent to nearly $25.4 billion.
So the resolution returned to 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with an explosion and massive shifts of position on the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only recently responded that customers strengthen smartphones and tablets instead of buying traditional computers and making more and more business online.
Whiteman's restructuring plans totalling around 55,000 jobs.
Conflict: The majority supports the Anti-IS Training Mission
However, the direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be largely due to decline: 54 per cent spoke out against it, 35 per cent agreed.
Other countries' air attacks against IS in Iraq and Syria are 61% positive.
In contrast, 24 per cent are involved in the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian Governor Bashar al-Assad will cost 51 per cent of the respondents, 20 per cent would be for that.
29% couldn't decide.
Car: Second Press Day on the 66th IAA
At the centre of the show are connected by 27 September, self-propelled cars as well as electromobility.
After two press days, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Car Exhibition under the motto "Reconnected mobility" on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA on Saturday.
The organizers from the VDA car chain count as two years ago with some 900 000 visitors.
Russian: violence at Serbian-Hungary border
The Hungarian police have used the Serbian border in Russia's Trenengas and waterworks against hundreds of refugees.
Euronews Correspondent Daniel Bozsik has experienced the use of force at the border control point.
He reported on phone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
A police line had been formed and behind the police was a water heater.
From 40 to 50 refugees started to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles into the offices.
The officers first set up an uninterrupted buffer spray.
Then the police used Trenengas.
A lot of trains were promised in the direction of the refugees.
The group was dissolved.
The refugees are now waiting for something back.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the area.
Children who had introduced the train gang screamed.
Other refugees slept together and lay under breath.
The press speakers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries through the use of Trenengas and puffer spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US notation bank
The world observes when the US note bank meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday to decide whether or not the interest will be raised for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists interviewed by Reuters revealed that a little more than half the last week of the vision that the fed will do this, now thinks that the feed will be a little longer and the interest rates will remain at the current rate of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historical event because it's been here for seven years since the Fed Zinsen placed on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a leading staff member at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is in a relatively good position, billions of dollars are added to the balance and only generate low inflation.
However, the fat cannot ignore the less pink look on global conditions.
She warned the markets to focus on an increase, but the signs indicated that the opportunities for such a step are good.
The decision should be announced at 2 p.m. on Thursday
Death protection at Delta State University behind Apologize letters
After his friend was shot and killed in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the day of his death - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that it was "sorry" to him at the first murder and wanted to "make it clear," the authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10:00 on Monday morning.
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff of the Notuf central that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "good dog" was in the house, but "no one's going to be upset", but he'll probably be up.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it to him.
Lamb had no explanation for his shots.
When the police told the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a written note of Lamb, 45, who said: "I'm sorry, I wish I could do it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman I've ever loved."
After writing the note, Lamb 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening as a policeman.
The University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lambs's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, the lamp claimed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday, there was "no information, no evidence" for a "tried relationship".
Prentiss was described as a "good man" by Shawn O'Steen, who noticed that they were married for about seven years.
The two were killed 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentis had a daughter who is 19, and she was "damaged on the ground."
He said Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, following a statement by Lindday Knowles, which was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had suffered from lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that Lamb had been contacted at a certain point on Monday to tell them "He didn't go to jail".
When the police arrested him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, flew on foot, fell into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctoral title from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that have lost their luck charmer
The player (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought against Leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor is also likely to fight drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this will surely require his tributus.
Eurowings: Airthansa builds the group around
The Lufthansa is planning a large group building.
A half billion euros a year will be saved only by the Lufthansa Group with a better organization.
150 of the world's 1000 leadership forces will cost their jobs.
With pilot cooperation there are new negotiations.
The Lufthansa builds its corporate structure around and reassesssing the eurowings billings.
The aim of the restructuring was to contribute around EUR 500 million per year from cost and rescue energy, which was shared by the airlines on Wednesday.
Among other things, there is no future board for the passenger business in the Lufthansa.
Eurowings should be developed as individually as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the Governing Body of Chief Carsten Sporhr.
With the renewal, Spoh highlights the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group wants to take action against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000 employees has been a complex undertaking.
The flights were operated under the roof of the Passage Airlines Group, which has three quarters of the annual budget of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In conflict with the Cockpit (VC), the negotiations should be resumed on this Thursday following the trial.
This was part of the cooperation.
The subject of the conversation should be the peace settlement for pilots.
Cockpit wants "in one year with a forecasted record result" as soon as possible to deliver viable results.
The conflict between cooperation and Airlines has led to various conflicts over the past months.
In addition to the pilot's transition, the "Wings" concept is the backbone.
It is expected that the Lufthansa will launch the Eurowings Group Billings in the fight against competitors.

Luke Shaw from Manchester United can't play for months because of double fractur
Luke Shaw is a double fracture of his right leg at the foot of the Championship League of Manchester at the PSV Endhoven.
While this brought the left foreign defender to the wine and he will be excluded for at least six months from the game, Louis van Gaal does not hope that Shaw can play again in this season.
The damage was caused by an indiscriminate attack by Hector Moreno in the 15th minute after 20 years old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being brought into the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's horrible - a young man who comes with 18 to Manchester United, it's very hard and then plays fantastically, and then it happens.
In the surrounding cabin he had a oxygen mask.
He's gone.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have a red card and the connection of an elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the judge, did not punish the Mexicans.
Van Gaal doubted that the Italian judge had called himself.
You can judge for yourself if I say that an elfmeter and a red card were missing.
It was a very worse attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account said: "I thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how hard I am, my way to generation now starts, I'll come back stronger."
About: Manchester United leads to the loss of Luke Shaw at the download at the PSV
The English trader has an additional reason for winning until next June with the European Championship in France.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad accident."
If a player with this kind of damage leaves the place, everyone is very sad about it.
It's never our player's intention to hurt an opponent.
Moreno has a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland's team at the WM 2014.
"It's very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the enemy, and if you hear that it's a very bad injury, it's not good," said Cocu.
It wasn't possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was headed in another direction, so it looked as if he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel so bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardo was also taken to the hospital - after a folklore by Chris Smalling.
Are you sure David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It's one thing that all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't last long until you know it almost exclusively.
It's because maybe you're David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite childhood book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax, the environmental label of Dr. Seuss, appeared in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company SuperCamps website, and continues: "Furtherly, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I want to read to my children, because it always seems like to give us a picture or a message we've missed so far."
Everything is beautiful and good, except that the following paragraph, which says Cameron describes the operation of the book, shows again a content of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to increase the relatively short original text.
"In the middle of the surrounded town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a young man named Ted, who hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dream by seeing her desire to see a real tree," read. A love interest was expressed by Dr. Seuss, whose real name Theodor Seuss Geisel listened and died in 1991 but completely unknown.
Whether this is not yet suspicious: The text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database and begins: "In the surrounded town of Thneed-Ville, where everything is art and even the air is a commodity, a young man named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron has so little confidence in the operation of the book. Here a young man is hearing how the local environment falls by the moneyier, fallen trees, threeding alone despite the protests of the so-called Lorax, a shocking, grueling being, "that speaks in the name of the tree," is wiped out.
Most likely such a relatively low PR assignment was delegated to an assistant, who did not read The Lorax 20 times after a child.
A Downing Street speaker said the text was probably from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text of Cameron's staff was delivered, but no further direct comments were given.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's crew, but it's still hard.
On Pakistan to stand in the United Arab Emirates, it is a difficult task, but if you see the frame that has chosen England for the tour, there is a repetition of the 3-0 test series downset not on my card.
I wouldn't have excluded an exception.
Alastair Cooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in Batting's performance, and the Community spirit is strong; they will not wear any flags from 2012, just a young-positive setting.
With the ball Moen Ali develops as spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at test level, it is an option for the attack.
About this message: Adam Lyth separates from the English test framework and is replaced by Alex Halles.
The decision to release Adam Lyth is of course difficult for me as his chief coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no questions with Joe Root, for example, and this led to nomination, there - and I said this before - players are their own best choices.
Long ago you had extended Lyth's course, but he had control of his own destiny.
If he's expected to launch another race for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
The English coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not have such good performances, and I am not surprised; he is, above all, a team man.
The question of how long a test-man gets to put his characters is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robinson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and outdoor games.
The only argument you can raise was that England was first used by Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in here, and he's a fighter I highly value.
He is an X-factor cricket player, what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he reached 236 against us at a Trent Bridge place, what happened to us very much.
He must have at least the same opportunities as those before him, but this is of course dependent on the mansion in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of not being able to fight in addition to Cook, what would get an extra spin-bowler and get four quicks, grew up, and I had nothing to do with it.
I don't see why a fighter can't beat there, and this left-hand man has already shown that he's a devil scarf of cricket players.
Moen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He's got three hundred rans right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the frame as a back-up spinner, and in my limited relationship with him he has impressed me as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - average 31 with the shooter and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there are no large numbers of backups that raise their hands and trainers have decided for young people.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the crew, England has made a couple of hours of additions to the trainer's loss.
The appointment of Mahela Jayowardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as an adviser to the test games could be a master Cup.
He is one of the next guys in the game that will bring a lot of experiences, because he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup.
I have always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and as Mahela has views that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the surrounding cabin, even if the news is in line with what has been said.
Collys team colleague at Durham, Ben Stokes, will not be used at the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team manufacturers do not determine the timetable.
And you have to think that how players depend on their jobs on the results.
Such decisions are not easy to make.
The Brexit stock (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could be won when the economy is in a fleet by 2017
David Camerons, an unexplained renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU, is faced with more every day with difficulties, even without the choice of General Jeremy "Is there Yes or No?" Corbin to the leader of Labour or the TUC, who struggles hard for Europe on Sunday.
Foreigners also have their Corbins and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic friend once again said that some Member States, as deeply involved in various crises as the EU is now, and not always out of their own debt, the United Kingdom itself has set up an agenda with stalemates and conflicting contractual changes that they do not want most.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that this was not acceptable when it threatened social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance focus on summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, make a picture of themselves before a famous local memory, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they are bound for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants a look out of Britain in the EU cell - "Don't let us go alone with France," says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short-term ministers and officials have come to some major cities to the point where they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany is cautiously special Chancellor Angela Merkel is an associate, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as was the case with the overcrowded long absences like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Hollande looks at his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He's also a destructive force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain has a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will be kicked out of a leg to help the Selfie Brides whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's Austria from the UK - something they don't want because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
That is why some such ministers may not even deliberately plan helpful comments, even in the SNP style, during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a plot" and "The Great Britain won't win anything from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how radically the Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU sceptics are the Olympics of the Press Baron, as they were during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which was not supported by our 1973 entry with a ratio of 2:1.
They may fail to remember Boris Johnson, who has made a name as a "EU-generated banana" correspondent in Brussels in the early 1990s.
At all his bullshit Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of Tax Fearful Squads, telephone hacking foreigners and the pseudo Non-Inlanders, who own most of our large newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought similar to her, but found that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you'd better distribute bananas to relax him instead of being his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendumswirl because Blair had laid down the principle of the EU's unadmissive constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a backend for him.
The press never let him do it.
But the poor Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly hug on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he didn't need any time to forgive me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's Boycott Mordoch strategy of the 1980s, a mistake at that time and today.
It can last, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose BBC-Sofa he left on Sunday.
Corby's official position in Europe is - I am putting it out kindly - in development.
He says we should remain in a reformed EU.
Now, most people outside of Ukips are traditional blue-coloured trends and the wildest films of Tory's Small Englishism, perhaps everyone can say yes.
It's what Hillary said "A Ben, but no Bennite" Ben on the radio and on television this week when the roadfinder fought in him, not to admit that Corby's appointment of the provosing John McDonnell as a shadow-cancer was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried to be unfaithful to his colleagues at work without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hillary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to remain "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnel said or what JC told his colleagues and colleagues after all reports at their closing meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the moving bottom-up image of Corbyn always wants to convey - think it has even done me - News discipline remains important in the time of TV around the clock and above all in the social media strudel, a brothel of Paranoia and Verrat.
It is true that Cameron does not give a free card for Europe, which allows him to keep laburs support in the referendum campaign for a sense of self-defence, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental diversity of EU membership - in line with their benchmarking economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of the debate on left-wing dissidents, for which the narcissism of the little difference is a central principle of dogmatism.
As with its multiplicity to Nato - Tom Watson is convinced perfectly that JC does not start a campaign for Austria - foreign diplomats are obliged to try to find a sense of their proposed home.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital - they also have mysterious voters - in order to make claims to the British if this could be pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a reduction in the cost of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the beginning of the month of something called the British Impact Security Forum.
Experts criticise Report of Public Health England on E-Zigaretten
According to a government-funded agency, e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking caused by a meeting of 12 people, in part by links to the tobacco industry, researchers say.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticising evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "foundation report" last month and describes it as a "extensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the accuracy of data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A leading article in Lancet's medical journal last month hit the "extraordinary wind base", based on the PHE's most important conclusion.
Two other researchers wrote in BMJ and asked whether the claims "building on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expected the claim of PHE that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, these statements come from a single session of 12 people who were invited to develop a model of multi-stakeholder decision analysis (MCDA) to lead their opinions on the damage caused by various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health whose business leaders should have received before British American Tobacco Metel (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT's references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said that they would receive funds from an e-Zigaraten producer but not the funding he was expected to receive according to reports from Philip Morris International.
The reasons for the selection of members of the board are not provided, but several well-known e-Zigaretten champions, some of which also provide industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting also took part in the tobacco management of PHE.
The research work of the group "was markedly" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products at most criteria", writes McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the allegations of PHE that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes have served as a way of smoking for children or non-smokings" were popular.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ's allegations had already been responded.
He said, "E-Zigarates are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second live smoker dies in his search.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are relatively low, but that we still have to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence is and what is not, especially if there is so much public objection to the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking disease, and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ per year.
By providing clear evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking is a part of our national responsibility.
BBC should give EastEnders, says former Chief of Channel 4
The former president of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said commercial rivals "would give their right arm" for hit-shows like Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the round duty should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK agents.
He criticised the BBC to place public-law programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in hard-to-worked time windows against the most popular shows of its rivals and from transmitters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had been trying to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are being ordered or sent, which would also be clearly shown by non-subsidised rivals," said Johnson to the Overhouse Communications Committee in its study on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the turnover fee, which I do not hold for a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least produce it on programs that don't make or order others.
They send The Voice into a first-class time window because they want to get as wide as possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a white, it's ridiculous, it's natural nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax programme could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is a further, given both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this is supposed to be public-law television.
I don't think this would actually reduce the BBC.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, led by Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC should be on the hunt for evaluations "because of the ambitions of the people working there and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular BBC broadcasts are what the former director of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart in Edinburgh in 2003, suggested that BBC Shows like EastEnders should be sold.
Johnson said that the more public-law Nischen programs "should go to BBC4 where you can't measure the audience fairly, but they can carry out their tasks, and they can argue when they go to their seemingly holy missions to make 4 billion round duty fees, "Well, of course, we have created all these dark programs that nobody has seen."
They put them in a window of time in which no one ever wanted to see them.
Johnson told the Committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in relation to conditions which can be the best value out there.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a big value here for 150 £ per year, but for people who are a lot of money for 150 £, ask me if that's right because they don't consume much from the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who also attended the Committee on Tuesday, requested that the BBC examine its Reitian mission, "to inform, shape and maintain it".
He said that only a few of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on radio - and she should take an example from the public-law television broadcasters in Australia and Canada to change this in "information, clarify and maintain".
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas like the Proms he said that only one handball would be shown on television and join the commercial transmitters to make everything available online.
Sonogenetics can control brain cells by cell waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment they are exposed to hearing pulses.
Scientists have developed tumors with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by blasts of shellholes.
The Winning Nematodes change the direction at the moment they are exposed to loud pulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard.
The pulses work by turning off motoreuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound cells.
Further on this subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the Würmer showed the power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, at the ultrasound to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the process of deep brain stimulation could replace an invasive process that gives electrical impulses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Fadenfurmers usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with microscopic explosives.
The blasts, he found out, strengthened the ultrasonic waves that then end up in the waves.
The reinforced ultrasound cells affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the wet cells.
The shell waves affect the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned, such as a Nature Communications report.
In order to create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the tumors so that some of its motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applies ultrashell to the changed creatures, the shell waves are strengthened by the micro-glasses and transferred to the vacuumers where they turn on the modified motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a travel tool that allows scientists to turn neurons into and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics might have some advantages against this technique.
In contrast to light, which must be transferred to the desired position in the brain at an optical stage, low frequency ultrasound tissue can pass without stopping and can thus be sent into the brain from above to the wound.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the target human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The ads are damaged by the British arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Waffen Messen video.
Terrible killer drums!
Fulgelinking painkillers!
In the stream!
And electroshocks that cause cool pain, but don't leave behind a trail!
The happy voices and Cartoon images are no doubt that this declaration for the world's largest arms race is a battleground produced by Amnesty International to bring the British Government's readiness to launch weapons on a repressive regime on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the exCel Centre in London Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are to be seen at bus stations and in the U-road trains and require a second look.
"Main announcement: Do you travel from 15 to 18 September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) you read in the fonts of London Underground and the marks of the DLR line that turn into a banner.
In September a warm arms dealer will drive with the DLR ... Customers will be asked to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who have shown their work at the Museum for Graphic Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group participated in the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6-£ package of bus keys, from which it is claimed that "Access access to around one third of the bus stop advertising areas on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this poster "Vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and Dozen at the University of Essex, artists will become critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements to work and note that they have to act outside the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arm trade plate is the pendler in the U.S.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the VCCP advertising agency, which works jointly with the graphicr and voiceover artist who also works free of charge.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was amazed at the style that ruled around the advertising for the arms trade - through an empty space of the exCel calendar - and thought, "We give them the campaign to avoid them."
They were playing with the discovery of a more realistic firm application, but "it remained stronger through the introduction of bright colors and animation."
"They have done a great job by helping us to gain awareness about the sale of illegal folder devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is a call from the British government and the guarantee that foot-and-mouth equipment will not be treated illegally in front of our house.
Perhaps the most creative art around the weaponry comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors are enchanting fantastic euhemistic products.
In a press release, Sab reveals an order from the US Army concerning "the AT4CS RS taken from the shoulder."
This includes "a uniquely shaped fathead which produces excellent effects within the target."

Eight golden rules for living in student homes
Eight years ago, I went to a student home as a self-lost 19-year-old, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the bitter laughs of those I have raised - and the many long-term complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The introduction into students' homes is quite surprising from easy nerve-relieving to absolutely terrifying.
It's exciting to blackout: Tell people where you're coming, where you've taken a Saturday year where you're on Corbyn and why you're "truely told Martha you don't love or hate because in pregnancy, boy, it's just a HaHA extract, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It slows the conversation and helps you find out the people you like to be in contrast to those you wouldn't talk to, even if your wimpers were burning in fire and these fire extinguishers.
Let people go.
The rooms of people are often transformed into drinking recipes, film night events and local meeting points, but they are also the places where people are attracted to and brought back to their basements.
About: Don't think about starting the union with a relationship
Introverts receive serious treatment at the university.
Her room should be a refugee, but many students' homes form a space-to-room boom culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be the pit for someone who's trying to get caught.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to leave to get back the energy I used to interact with you."
Try to smell when a committee is created by society - and send him a text message instead.
Make calls: Do it.
A guy in my students' homes had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship through the back.
Since you start the unit at the top of the back manie, the key to people's doors is to introduce yourself to a speaker full of brownies, less rarely than the welcome of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've left you something behind. So, and now, if I ask you a few personal questions."
A good way to end friendships is to offer home-based toys.
Your residents feel obliged to stay and may eventually join your face with a nice surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a suitable baker.
Bad mixed shells of flour, sugar and fat lead people to sleep when you attack.
Storing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, it's the clover of Hühchen's chair, but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this out with the milk owner.
The chances are that they say to serve themselves even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's embarrassing, and you have my feelings - but try to treat me as my fellow citizen who added to her milk a spray to punish diabetes.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn't make any noise, people stay out of bed or work.
It's not just because you're a decent person, but because you belong in the real sense of the word to the people who sit in the glasshouse.
A girl on my floor asked her neighbors if it was possible for them to put some drums and bass into something else, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded to it with even more subtle music.
When they finally stopped at 5 o'clock, they kindly let their neighbors sleep for another two hours before they let their own music play, closed their door and went to their three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if you and your future mate were to get into the same student home?
Would it not be genuinely painful if you were to hold a partner for your future spouse, get along with her, get away with her, and then have to see her every day and maybe live through the way she all her friends get together?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a warm resident is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to instill some sense in your underworld.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his key in his closed room, the border between a cloud and moving is nicer than it seems.
A good strike is funny, but it takes only a moment to get to the boomerang.
By hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but never pollute any room with toothpasta and shampoo.
Lock her door and place her keys in a glass of water which you then put in the refrigerator - but don't thank her possessions on the deck more than twice.
Houses for refugees, lonely people, low-value workers
Real Estate Entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building in the central Ecental Line House for people who do not have much money.
So it's about refugees - but also as a sign: "Not only refugees need a living room, but also the single mother and the little ones."
"I'll show you how you can build still cheap and good today," says 44-year-olds in the interview
Thousands of refugees are forced into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly a cheap living room can be created: He is building in a project of street houses for refugees.
Mr. Goldner, many refugees will be forced into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass delivery in containers or tournaments has no sustainability.
Because people stay a large part of here.
In view of the refugee stream, we also need adequate housing in the next few decades.
A completely banana, triangular row house is the solution.
Goldner: A row house needs at least one place.
It facilitates integration.
That's different when people are subjected to blockades.
Each of the six houses built directly in the pilot project consists of three housing units for each of four asylum seekers.
Each apartment has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees are told, it's peace again, I'm going back.
The houses can then be easily restructured according to their respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Goldner: The price for 160 square metres living area per house is EUR 184,000, without any base.
That's eye-opening.
Six months has lasted the building.
That's right.
Have the construction regulations complicated their plans?
Guildner: I have just done my project correctly.
In particular, it is always complicated by the damocles black special construction and the position regulation.
That's terrible.
It is still subject to the need for at least three seats in a row house.
It's only in the cities that there's room for it.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their project?
Goldner: There were some who called me to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which definitely doesn't agree.
But don't you force the competition for affordable apartments?
Goldner: Yes, it is: In the last five years, we had a building in Germany, but luxury apartments were built that can afford almost one more.
My project has the message, as well as the normal people need living room.
Not only refugees but also the single mother or the low-income.
I'll show you how you can build a nice and good one today.
That's why it's going.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first worked with environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is published
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings App, typing "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If it is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have fallen into problems after installation, as they receive an error message which indicates that the "software update" has failed.
To address the problem, it is recommended that users either wait until the storm comes back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting Apps to create space - but Apple has made it unlikely by switching the update. It will also be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and reinstall them as soon as the process is finished.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is loaded during the update or is located near a charging device so that the battery is loaded.
If the download is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may be halfway off and this could lead to an interruption of the update.

You should also ensure that before your download you have reviewed our checklist of all things to prevent things from going wrong and protecting themselves if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much clearer personal assistants and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only device: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows about the WM title in formula 1 against his clear leader Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton only one more device: "Volle Attack".
The WM-second stressed before the start in the decisive seven oversea races "that I don't have to lose anything more".
53 points are separated by the vice-president in Singapore before the end of the day by the title-protection and two-party champion Hamilton.
The British has already won seven of the twelve seasons so far and has also taken the Flulight Grand Prix in the city as a favorite attack.
2009 and in the past 30 years, Britain has been able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city will have an impact on Singapore's high price, it is still unclear.
Since day, a dark bell has been hanging over the city, excavated by fires on the nearby island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfriend Bad Kissingen" founded three months ago included another member in its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is the first class and honorary citizens of the city of Espelkamp and Lübecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen supported Gauselmann with a contribution from President Alfred Klein.
It is therefore possible to include chess players who are unable to make the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wants to see the membership in the chess club as well as friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-White" as an expression of his relationship with the city.
Room office is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Altencentrum Antonistif have gathered together under the cover of the Social Foundation and opened a new station at the Count Stuffenberg Square.
In addition to consultations there you can also participate in courses.
The Social Foundation is located above the mountain in the inner city.
This is exactly what is said at the Count Stuffenberg Square.
A new district office was recently opened there.
Here, immediately next to the shopping market, you will receive information from adults and counselors on issues such as care insurance or the services of hospitals and nursing homes.
Over the years, we have found with our ambulance service that carers are often left alone.
There are, of course, many questions.
"Neither are many of the services of the casinos rarely received because the complexity of the insurance is not yet understood," explained the new housekeeper Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistist and the Civil Hospital as well as for the Amadeus ambulance.
In addition to the consultations, the new Quartiers Bureau also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
In this way, Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as noise prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment can be used.
The offers from the centre of seniority and Saludis are perfect.
Saludis is for prevention, care and reha.
"The Senior Center for Care and Care," Heike Riedel, director of Saludis, described.
The reason for opening the new district office in the city is seen by both business leaders in particular in the demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentral infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg's future.
In addition, thus underlined by Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) at the event, the Quartiers Bureau also devoted itself to the association of the age: "There are many events and offers on the program and these are being regularly presented to a regular event".
As a result, the Social Foundation has played a major role in enabling adults to live as independent and well as possible in their trusted environment.
The room office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 hours, Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 hours and on Saturday from 10 to 12 hours.
Entry by Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it's official: After work on sanitation at the foot-and-mouth station for the game FC entry Bamberg was not yet established against the third list of Würzburger kickers, it was now established as the term on 6 October.
The encounter with the FC entry Bamberg at the end of the Bayern Football Totopokals against the third list of FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finalized.
It will be played on Tuesday, 6 October at 19 a.m. in Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we know now that when the game goes over the stage, we now have planning security," says FCE teamman Karlheinz Hämmer, who also points to the card sales now started.
It's particularly important for our team to play against a third-party list.
We therefore look forward to many observers, and this is not without reason, because fluid games have a special trip.
Around the last 16 missions, the FC entry Bamberg 2010 entered the area list 1. FC Overhaid (3:1) and home against the regional list 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives EUR 5000 and is qualified for the first round of the DFB Unionpocal 2016/2017.
Title Defender is a third-party SVgg sub-higher.
Wiener Architect Karl Mang died 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of the Vienna architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92, as the artist's house reported on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist house loses an honor member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was revealed.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna during and after World War II at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freeman architect, but he has also worked as a teacher, writer and institutional director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute for Forming.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned by the establishment of the chess room in Vienna Hofburg and the reconstruction of the Lobkowitz Palace in the Austrian Theater Museum.
Park punishment: Tim Wise hires police with money
Ex-Footballer Tim Wiese is found in brakes.
Foßballer was once, however, Tim Wiese, former National Hüter in Germany and was engaged in Bremen and Hopeneheim, Wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass he wants to have given his own statement over the past two years.
He didn't act wisely.
How did he cut his hair right in the Bremer Innstadt when he saw out a parking guard showing a list of punishments for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Some of them were driven out of the business, insulted the waitress and punished her for the money before her feet, as the "image" newspaper reports.
At Bremen City, you confirm the probation, the consequences of the unusual incident are still not clear.
"The case is still in the trial," says Bremen.
Only then will a decision be made whether or not the way will be shown.
Panama's authorities destroyed 4500 Marihuana plants
The fruitful soil and the rain forest-type climate of the Isla del Rey are best suited for the meditation of the Marihuana plants.
After three days, the Panamanian authorities destroyed the 4500 plants and burned them.
Men commit suicide on 17-year-old Afghans
The police are looking for an event in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday, at 23.45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed the police's two friends in a distance of about five meters and called on them to wait for him.
At this point, the group is located at the height of the bft dance station.
On the ground of the tank station, three persons also stood up.
One of these men now screamed at the young men and struck it with the fist in his face.
The victim suffered a nose fracture and was severely bleeding from the nose.
When his two friends repeatedly and violently attacked the victim, he gave up his sacrifice first.
From his friends, the last young man was now taken home.
The aunt followed the group with a pkw up to their apartment and went on demonstration several times over there.
When you didn't see the vehicle anymore, the wounded went before the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the victim and another man.
With the help of a hit-and-run stock, the victim's face and the upper leg of the victim came into contact.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far there is only one vague description of the child.
One of the men was about 1,80 meters tall.
The second shooter was to be about 1,65 meters wide and was dressed with a Jeans and a brown-white helmet.
The police call witnesses and indicators to report under phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Praxis Felstehausen and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müll-Goll and Frank Müller (left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
In addition, Mr. Bernd Bormann, Mr. Uta Seim-Sewartz and Mr. Asendorfs, Mr. Heinfried Kabbert, are pleased.
In many places there are no doctors in the country - Asendorf is lucky: there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen is on the way to rest, her husband Karl-Heinrich stands next to his successor in the next few months with a half seat.
After a refurbishment phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October until he invests 310000 euros in the spaces at St. Marcellusstraße 6.
It was Sympathy at first sight when the Falster Houses of Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Mülle-Goll, who are currently completing their vocational training at the World Hospital, wanted to join the practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and Laugh.
"When it was so far, I just called her."
The husband Müller liked the idea of running his own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years."
As a result, he too will soon be his own boss.
And that's how it became known that the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
They will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There the two family fathers, Frank Müller, also grew up, followed by his medical study in Hanover at several medical clinics as well as at hospitals in Sullingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently active as an oberazt in Sulingen, and he was ordered to lead notarzt in the district of Diepholz in 2009 and is committed to honour in the preparation of the DRC Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September the practice will be prepared for the new chief.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen worked as a housewife, his Gattin Ursel (Internistin) specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internalists, want to leave themselves as housekeepers.
"The Endoscopy is coming out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müll.
After the reconstruction, the rooms will look modern.
We will offer more ultrasound surveys as well as long-term and tax-related ECGs and need a more speech room.
In addition, the ETV will be fully restored.
A total of EUR 50000 is granted to the Müllers under a programme of aid from the countryside (EUR 25000) and from the total (EUR 12500) and the Community (12500).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that practice will be continued," said Mr. Bernd Bormann.
About 2000 patients come according to Silvia Müll-Goll every quarter to the practice of Felstehausen, in the northern German average practice there are about 500.
There is another practice of home use in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller: The apotheque remains according to Ursel Felstehausen in Asendorf.
If they had not found any followers, they would have gone.
Those who visit Müller’s speech hour also continue to look, above all, in confidence: takes over the seven medical trade stations and the cleansing power of the countryside houses.
Their decision ended an era in Asendorf, where doctors have been practicing there for 30 years.
"At first we had only two rooms," recalls Ursel Felstehausen beautifully.
A bit of wetness has been in her for a long time.
"But we are still living in Hohenmor and many patients will still be safe to see," says the Internist.
Your husband adds, "We have a 6000 square meters base."
"I've always pushed Bisher before garden work, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two singles and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We're letting the refugees through"
"Now border controls will also be high on our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel to this.
As it turns out, anyone who wants to make an asylum application can do this "of course" too.
The supply and security of humans are in the forefront.
However, it is also clear that "that there is a need for clear signals", said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, nor over the Austrian-Slovene border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "Corridor" - Slovenia rejected
The Croatian Government had previously announced that Slovenia would also want to allow refugees to travel in the direction of Austria and Germany and also create corridors for refugees under circumstances.
However, this was not the case with Interior Minister Vesna Györkós Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will increasingly intensify border surveillance - especially for Hungary.
The border with Croatia has already been severely controlled as the outside border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister pointed out, Slovenia does not want to break its restrictions on refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil his obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," Györkös Znidar stressed.
As the Croatian government reported, the first refugees had already tried to travel through Eastern Croatia on the border to Tovarnik/Sid to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to attack her in the nearby Maisfields.
According to local media, since the Croatian Tovarnik, police vehicles have been constantly encountered with new refugees.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country counted about 4000 refugees, Minister of Interior Ranko Ostojic said.
In addition, buses from Presevo to the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would guide Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, argues that it is to show people to hit certain routes: "We can or will do this again," he said.
According to the media reports, in the morning an initial bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of Sid would be expected to take another bus during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The Insassins were on their way all night from the Macedonian border about 500 kilometers away from Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungary is in trouble, so the police told us we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria further to Germany.
This could actually lead to a further western route from the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Mazedonia-Serbia-Serbia-Serbia.
Croatia: "Encompassing opportunities for border control"
Croatian Interior Minister Ostojic had stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible derogations for the case of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member has "concealed possibilities for border control".
Strong controls are being carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a good witness to the country since 2007 with regard to the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees behind the Hungarian border.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the last night crossing Horgos, which leads to Russia.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Bakki Breg remain completely blocked.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border, it is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday at a local news station in Horgos: He held the debate on alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border has now been closed.
It would not be very high at present.
It is still impossible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Help rate migrants to - dangerous - Alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to share country maps on which alternative routes are designated by Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not inevitable: in parts of the border area, there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war there are still not areas of land.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of miners had been sent to the border region.
Börsen-Hacker: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is supposed to have heard a call from cyber criminals, which has been claimed to have been getting more and more attention since 2010 in unpublished financial reports and press releases on sites such as Business Wire, Market Wire and PR Newswire.
Insider business should be made available on the financial markets with the information provided.
In this way, the investigators were totaled over $100 million.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders will be arrested recently," says the SEC Communication.
The proceedings against 32 other accused were pending.
Most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The deaths should have taken place both in the United States and in Eastern Europe.
Ökumenische Hospitife Mannheim has been there for 20 years
Around the Men's Paradeplatz, the government rules the operation.
People do their concerns, partly rapid steps, partly mildly bulging.
They control the two stations of the mansion car salon at the Paradeplatz.
Keep the city streets.
Pulsier life at a wonderful autumn sun and in the middle of four large tables each with the title "Before I want to die"....
The Ökumenic hospital assistance focused on this action on its 20-year-old existence and is faced with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went through the middle of the action into the city and under the people," says Josefine Lamber.
The head of the Ökumenian Hospital is also available to the delegates for questions and discussions, as well as to the honourable staff.
While sometimes a passive spontaneous picks up on the lap and says "sit my life", "can read", "with the camper running through the United States", "stop the war" or "not long suffering", others stay short, read, say phrases like "I am not yet" and then go on.
There are always small discussions on the action at the edge of the border about life, dealing with death.
Peter Hübinger's right in front of the place.
"Only if I make it clear that the end of this world will ever come to me, I can live responsiblely," says the Director of the Diaconic Work Mannheim, who is together with the Caritas Association of the Akkumenic Hospital.
Therefore, this public action has been good for 20 years.
However, it is understandable that not everyone wants to be public on the tables, and finally it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death had been captured as before with Tabus, so the experience of Josephine Lamber, although just the host movement in recent years has contributed much to opening up people.
An evaluation that shares Angelika Godfroid.
The death and grief companion is one of the honourary staff of the first hour.
Through personal experience with the subject, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the death assistance.
When the Ökumenian hospital assistance was sought by the authorities on appeal, she immediately reported and was present at the establishment in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 officials - 43 women and two men - who are involved and members of private households, hospitals, nursing homes and the Sankt Vincent Hospital.
They've all been taken care of.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and with her experiences and experiences.
"I see the life of another waiter, keep it costable and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulatory Ocumen Hospital is free of charge and free of charge.
The financial support of the patient's boxes and contributions from members and associations enables training as well as continuing training and supervision of the death and grief partners.
Every two years, training is offered for new staff.
The tables described on Saturday are now in the house of the evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Other personal wishes can also be noted on Postcards.
FedEx results mixed, financial views reduced for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supplier-Gigant reduced its profit view to a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its underground transport service.
The company also said it plans to house about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this point, FedEx announced last year that the company wanted to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in Premarket Management 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the business year ending next May, 20 cent less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected a question from FactSet $10.84.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which averages 4.9 per cent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher subsidies for underground transport of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November.
The company said that it was still expected that the result would be increased by cost cuts, higher revenues and by online growth.
Charman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "contains solid income when considering the weak economic conditions expected, especially in manufacturing and global trade, in view of the weak.
The holiday employment plans were announced one day later than those of the Rivalen UPS, which planned to set up 90,000 to 95,000 additional labour forces, such as the same number in the last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result of each share was $2.42 per share, almost $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
The turnover rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been registering a decline in international priority transmission in recent years, which led to trade in its unit of express transmission to stagnating.
But the tree in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in ground transport increased by 29 per cent, but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The unit of expression recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result was lower due to higher labour costs in freight.
In premarket trade, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fall by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $15.15.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent of a record on 11 June.
At its most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Strategies spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduran Mahogoni table to decide whether it is time to increase the lead for the first time in almost a decade.
Looking at them at the end of the two-seat sitting room, there is a wall image of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are going to put the economic interests of the nation above all other things.
The central bank has a double order from the Congress: maximizing US employment and maintaining prices.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too difficult to predict. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start, from the unprecedented rise by the short-term interest rate close to zero since 2008.
Although most of the economic data show that they are growing well, the latest turbulence in global financial markets could make it difficult for those already expected to increase this volatility by increasing the interest rate for federal loans - and it is only a quarter of a percentage.
"It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing in the first line," said Lindsey M. Peegza, chief economist at the maker firm Stifle Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think, if they were looking for a precedent, not to raise interest rate, the increased uncertainty about the global market is enough to wait for justice," she said.
There is no consensus on what will be done by the fed, which will guarantee itself the financial market.
About half of the economies that were recently questioned by Bloomberg had predicted an increase in interest this week.
However, the financial markets expect a fat waiting with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This leads to a decline in the stock market if the fat increases the rate, it is because the strategies slow down the damage by promising that further increases are far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial averaged 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was resolved by expectations that Fed policy would maintain the set this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the liver had the sets at this time," he said.
If she does, "she had to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so she wouldn't panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would relieve financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the feed is processed.
A month ago, the fed seemed to be in a good way to raise the rate of 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow deterioration of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said in the morning and in the morning that despite the complaints of Liberals this year that more economic progress would be needed, an increase in the rate was expected.
Although the creation of jobs was slow in August, the improvement in the labour market was strong this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest since more than seven years and near the level where the feed is considered to be full-time.
Pay increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation continued under the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the feds said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can manage higher interest rates and need them because of the work market effort," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world ended up together in the last month after China had evaluated its currency.
In May, the Dow Jones Industrial averaged more than 16% below its peak, as investors were afraid that a decline in the Chinese economy would result in global growth.
The market has gained something this month, where the Dow is now about 10 % below the height of May.
For the fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation when the interest is to be raised.
"If the events on the financial markets and the reports about the Chinese economy's weakness had not been reported in the last few weeks, they would have attracted the wheels at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and an former US notation bank employee.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to get the effects better in the grip.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will affect the US economy, and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main causes of fatigue, so they should not be technically involved in their decision-making.
But in the end the Fed has become the world's currency authority.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The only indication of the former leader Ben. Bernanke in 2013 that the feds could "get" their monetary expansion, solved confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interfering with one another, fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Your decision finding is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabel, head of the global strategy for asset management of Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the fed has a history of over-reactions on financial market movements which appear not to be related to the economic fundamental data."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee which is used to raise interest, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the fed to reduce its leadership by 0.75 percentage points at three meetings "Despite limited effects on growth in the United States", Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives withdrew these cuts.
The Fed should focus on aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England.
The latest turbulence doesn't come near this level, he said.
"She certainly doesn't want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of rising interest rates because the markets are rising," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it is changed, I do not think it should predict the time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/the warehouse was opened in 1997 and owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market which is also sold to the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/the warehouse is a central place of entertainment and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and jewelry, furniture, religious beauty and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need motor oil.
The load is huge, and it takes an hour to break through the tracks.
If the whole shopping area makes you hungry, there is a meal time for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and priced) in this shop is located near the box and has various options.
What is it here: Do you need something - something - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are priced and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat tree is extensive as well as the fish tree - the staff behind the teak will clean and filtrate the fish and even feed on desire for you.
A good part of the cargo is the massive refrigeration department. Here you can find frozen Curry leaves, bitter melons and galgant, all entries, fish, red blood and galleys, Swine-natural Darm, fishing balls, regional farm, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and cookers, as well as individual families and individuals.
The wide ranges are suitable for shopping carts and goblets.
You can find here: fresh month Durian next to the box.
Where he is: The cargo is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the coast of Chinatown and the interior city - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small life assistance for refugees
More and more refugees come to Germany this day.
To prepare you a warm welcome, do not go without the commitment of countless honourable helpers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a number of people who support the city’s useless asylum seekers.
They belong to Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
With her 74 lenses she still likes to teach.
Every Thursday she does it at the asylum competition house at the Dillinger Street.
There they help refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German.
Of course, this is quite different from a proper school.
Brazil's Pediatric Society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy styles
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS is trying to explain to women in a shocking way how important good food is during rest time. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that protect breast-feeding who are conceived with appearances of unhealthy foods.
Mother milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results indicate that higher calorie consumption is not the only dietal adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually concerns the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can have a negative impact on the immune system.
Exceptions to the new Bernrider Sportshalle
The Bernried Council approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euros of its sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof must be flammable for solar system.
The plans for the long-designed turnhallen building on Bernrider Sports Areas are moving forward: In the recent Community Council meeting, the proposed building proposal was rejected in full without major discussions.
First of all, the Gremium had decided, inter alia, an application for a construction "exclusion" in respect of the "freedom" of the existing construction plan.
The "exclusion" included the permission for a special form of roof construction.
This is why a "satellach with non-extreme first and background" is to be created.
In the background of the planning, the intended use of the roof area for solar facilities is: "Then we get a wonderful big south together," said Mayor Josef Bergenberger at the meeting.
The "freedom" went back to the roof which was required for energy reasons - other than in the construction plan - to be below ten degrees.
The volume of the hall is significantly reduced by this.
A "freedom" was therefore necessary because the construction plan for roofing did not allow "exemptions" - in which the Bernrider Community Council generally carried out more restrictively with regard to exemption applications.
However, it is not a recurring project when it is being built: "We do not create a presidential case", says Mountenberger.
The turnhallen building at the sports center is a community project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
About 2.3 million euros are calculated at cost.
Grants are expected from school and broadband promotion.
In the next procedure, the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now submitted to the Landrasamt for examination.
Klinik Peißenberg draws to Schongau
The hospital Peißenberg will be closed earlier than planned - i.e. 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) is the new medical director at the hospital Schongau.
The station as well as the majority of staff travel from Peißenberg to Chongau.
This is seen in the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the countryside, confirmed by the Landrätin Andrea Jochner-Weisz.
However, a decision shall be taken by the Board of Supervisors and shall take place on Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the nearly 50 staff in the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to work.
The majority of the above should be transferred to Schongau with fishermen and the further existing internal station.
The rooms are available.
The employees who cannot go to Chongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, according to Jochner-Weather.
The staff will be informed of the plans.
The change has been resolved by Dr. Andreas Eder, who has since the beginning of the year been a medical director of the Schongauer Clinic and has now changed to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
On the question of who should be following, Jochner-Weisz, named "fisher" in the game that had been declared to be taking the lead from 1 October and changing with his team to Chongau.
For the house in Schongau this means "assessment" and an extension of the offer in the "Internal Medicine" area.
Fischer is a specialist for heart-steppers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases at the internal station.
For the next two years, fishermen and their team shall, if the Board of Supervisors agrees with it, lead both houses until the next year the former hospital of the crew, which has more than 35 beds, is to be completed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
Until then, the rural area had planned this for 2018 when the ongoing sanitation at Weilheim Hospital has been completed.
Landrätin Jochner-Weisz, also president of the Board of Supervisors, is against complaints that the house owned by the German company is to be used as a accommodation for asylum seekers in the future.
As with the property, Jochner could not say that there are several considerations.
There is currently a short-term care of the Caritas and a day-care clinic.
"What's better could not happen to us, such an opportunity won't come back," says Fischer about the Quasi approach to the body, which was "positive and very understanding" by the staff.
A real prospect for the house where the fisherman has worked as a chef for over 30 years has not given it.
He was asked by Mr Schongauer to take the position of the Medical Director.
The hospital Peißenberg (at least 100 beds) was again threatened by closure in the past decade, departments were closed, for example surgery and birth assistance.
The handballers of the Rhein-Neckar Löwäen are required tonight (20.15 p.m.) at the mountain HC.
The head of the Bundesliga table is in Wuppertal although the clear favorite, however, there is no possibility of over-relevantity.
In the last season, the bathrooms at the BHC were a painful landing site and had some fun there.
Jappun attack with two injuries at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were severely injured during their master's lunch break on Sunday.
During the abernence on a Maisfeld near Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg), several Jägers were in use as the police reported.
A 63-year-old and 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospitals.
How exactly it could have happened to the accident was initially unclear.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-olds from Rheinland-Pfalz Victims of Violence
An actual suspect has led the police to the body of the lost 16-year-old Rheinland Pfalz since Saturday.
In the audience, the 20-year-old had to kill the young people and have thrown their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old missing from the Rhineland Pfalz has been a victim of violence since Saturday.
The body of the young woman was found on the day of service in Rockenhausen at Kaiserslautern, as reported on Wednesday by the State Department and the police.
In fact, one of the 20-year-olds who was taken into service was also considered to have followed the statement and led the investigators to the foundation of the body.
The 16-year-old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she arrived home on the evening after a visit of a autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first placed the victim on personal matters.
Finally, when questions were raised in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing, there was an actual suspicion of the 20s.
The forced daughter then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen where the body was found.
The arrest was followed by the police officer who killed the 16-year-olds and placed the bodies in the canal.
The 20-year-old should be conducted on Wednesday to the shipper who is charged by the investigators.

Refugees need accommodation: A study alerts them to housing accidents
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for a affordable stay.
The pressure on the housing market is rising.
Social housing is a challenge.
The distribution wars on the German housing market have begun for a long time.
With the arrival of refugees and workers from the EU, more and more people are forced into a market that is already overloaded in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens about the last affordable apartments.
In order to cover the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units had to be built every year by 2020.
This result is a study commissioned by the "Social Housing Building" Association.
To compare: In Germany this year 260,000 units are completed.
As a result, 150,000 apartments are missing.
Refugees are no longer obliged after the first three months of their stay to live in an asylum seeker's residence.
Many then settled in the housing market and chose to join the long corners before the rental.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, in the last year less than half of all asylum applicants lived on the rent.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not limited to increasing refugee numbers.
The study also shows significant shortcomings in housing policy over the last few years.
Germany has created a housing deficit which is growing from year to year.
Currently there are about 770,000 housing units missing in the bulging areas, the author of the study complains Matthias Günther.
As a result, many professionals lived in large cities in WG-rooms.
Young adults remain in the "Hotel Mama" because of the flow in the housing market.
In major cities, the number of square meters per head has declined for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the "social housing" association proposes a new start.
New incentives are to re-equipped on social housing.
This could be avoided on the basis of the basic labour tax and the basic housing tax would be suspended.
In addition, the association considers that attractive tax write-off options are necessary.
The aid programme for refugee accommodation of the KfW State Bank is now being implemented in cities and communities.
A good week after the start, an amount of EUR 184 million was already over half of the EUR 300 million available on Monday evening.
The project could even be hidden now.
Refugees have free guidance: Croatia and Slovenia correct corridor
According to Hungary, there is virtually no more transit, as more refugees choose the road through Croatia.
Zagreb announces to provide the crossing of Slovenia to the north without hearings.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to understand with the neighbouring country Slovenia about establishing a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary we will organise a corridor," Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country yet.
After the fall of the Serbian-Hungary border, hundreds of refugees were deported to Croatia to reach Western Europe.
500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV transmitter RTL.
Hungary had abandoned its borders on refugees earlier.
New laws which enter into force on the same day make regular asylum procedures in Hungary practically overfishing.
Croatia wants to leave the refugees.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic stated: "They can travel, and we are ready for this opportunity."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there were people who didn't want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had attacked the first refugees at Serbia's border to the EU-near country of Croatia in the morning.
Most of the media reports are based on Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came by bus as well as by taxi to the Serbian border city of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they had tried to reach the green border to Croatia.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees were not on border areas.
The border crossings pose other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mining rooms should quickly create a safe passage.
According to Hungary, there are almost more refugees after the border is closed.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people arrested.
Shortly before the end of Monday, there were still 9380.
The new Hungarian legislation introduces the overcrowding and damage of border crossings as a punishment.
Therefore, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern border city of Szeged.
The convicted shall be sentenced to five years' imprisonment and expulsion from the country.
According to the immigration authority, on Tuesday, in the new "transit zones" introduced at the border, 94 asylum applications were rejected, almost all of them - 93 - in Russia's most important transition.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees had been detained.
In practice, however, no one else has the prospect of obtaining a visa in Hungary Asyl.
According to the Hungarian view, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The retired asylum seekers should be released there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered before the Transit Zone in Russia.
In Russia workers began to sleep with it.
They collected the mill that had left tens of thousands of people behind on the street last week.
Spergitters were built and one of the recorders was built in the border.
No one wanted to go outside for this building.
Only a few refugees reach Austria after the border between Serbia and Hungary is closed.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
About 20,000 migrants remained in government camps but remained in the country.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting on the road to Germany.
The train journey from there to Germany was stopped on the morning of the German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly hit their feet.
Mayor for "Gestrandite" across the border
"We were working after the bridge party on Sunday with the room when suddenly ten people stood at the entrance of the tent," said Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
Since Germany was surprised to travel with Austria on Sunday because of the flight current, it was in Wernstein Castle," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the strands together with two other drivers and their cars over the border near Passau.
Before we spent the unexpected guests once, with juice and drinks.
We've said the same thing. We'll take them with the car to Passau.
"That was of course for us," said Stadler in the OÖN speech.
They were very grateful.
A man could not afford to give up a large sum of money - 100 euros for the fire weapon.
"We've enjoyed it very much," said Stadler.
On Sunday evening in Wells, the stranded train passengers were moved by an ICE in a regional direction towards Passau in order to try to cross the border after the short notice made that the road traffic has been transferred to Germany.
However, the regional move was postponed before the border in Wernstein on the Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border approach is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival is popular with the Baierian neighbors on Sunday, days before a bicycle race sports – organised by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from Neukirchen.
The fact that Victor Orbán now sends us another thousand ziggs is a logical result of a seemingly sacred policy:
Instead of helping in the Russian camp to build structures that provide humanity, our federal Chancellor has officially and publicly abandoned the Hungarian government's attitude towards the Danish sphere of national socialism.
Unfortunately, this policy is not just those Austrians who are now faced with chaos in the border areas.
The refugees must also be determined that the "global country", which they have invited and welcomed, is nothing more than a refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge in view of the continuing flow of refugees and the upcoming winter, to create human rights for asylum seekers.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad on the search for 35,000 winter-fast neighborhoods
Konrad has to do all his hands full with the refugee surrender.
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight.
The government has used the most powerful Raiffeisen banks to set up quarters for thousands of refugees.
The Chaos in the Traiskirchen first station has already been hit by Konrad.
"We don't have any blinds anymore in Traiskichen," he reported on his first success.
The surrender of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also carried out without a great stir, Konrad said and praised the organizational "master performance".
The Ministry of the Interior spoke against a "crisisable situation".
In total, Konrad calculates a need of 85,000 quarters in the year.
In order to meet the number, another 35,000 accommodations must be found in the following weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the Federation.
If there's to be more refugees, we can create it.
"But it's not a phase without soil," said Konrad.
He has already spoken with the Head of State.
These had assured him that they would also create quarters for the next refugees.
"In Oberösterrey it works well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VPN mandater supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to explain how the church will help.
The Asyl Coordinator also puts great expectations into the ORF action "Help as we are".
On the platform, private persons can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, it is hoped that hotels will be empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticised yesterday's standards for the introduction as "very high".
In times of need it may not be that a quarterer must contain a certain height of the handle holder or size of the light.
For an extended period of time, "required standards" must apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, Konrad is based on his experience.
I am an older lord who is not without telling the truth.
It's the most important weapon in the world.
Konrad and Mayer did not cause the Republic to pay any expense, as they themselves stated.
They want to increase their number to three to four.
The own Quartet search has not been successful until now.
Konrad wanted to build a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are obvious problems with the approval.
Linz requires a better division
First of all, there is no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, as it is possible to bring those concerned without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, further sites should be checked for the emergency.
Criticism exercises the city chief at the division of refugees within the Federal Republic of Germany.
Other areas must also contribute here.
Sea oofer: "Liabilities are not reduced"
In a longer telephony with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on the next day on the refugee question.
Seehofer has assured me that the German boundaries will not be reversed.
The further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic was still possible.
However, there are also appropriate border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will not be given for the first time.
However, the asylum seekers would be brought with regular trains to Germany.
Leaders from other EU Member States once again called for greater solidarity in refugee matters.
The fact that Austria is now re-controlling its borders is "a logical consequence" for leaders from the German past.
The next runtastic is a question of time
The generalization of the "New Weft" in the Linzer industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six warehouses of the office and production building, the S&T-based IT group has been included, and the rest (2700 square metres) is to be rented to young innovative companies from the technology field.
"In IT, the heads of our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S&T Chief Hans Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Weft and then buying anything.
From the beginning, S&T wants to co-operate with the new neighbours - of which Niederhauser promises: "The next runtastic is only a matter of time".
EUR 1.7 million were invested in the site by S&T, EUR 3.3 million by the Tech Centre, which is one third of the city of Linz, the state of Oberösterreicht and the Federation (FFG).
The building is covered by the Linz AG for 60 years at S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of rest area in the building are already rented, for more 40 percent please ask.
Lia Peroni owner opened second business in the Arkade
Furla handbags are at the center of the new shop.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to hunt a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to put his hand up in the dust market arcade: Finally, she has grown up in the form of another business site.
In the Furla shop against the business in which they sell, among other things bags, bags, shoes and walls of various manufacturers, everything is now going to have 75 euros of cash from the Furla brand.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday, the new shop is in operation.
Several weeks ago it was built.
"But I've spent a long time explaining whether I'm going to open another load," says Bret.
The decision was exhilarating, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also influenced by the idea of a place where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the large Linz room who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who owns Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been widely placed by her mother in the streets.
I usually get tired when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why do so many women have to take care of a beautiful handbag, even the professional cannot answer with certainty.
Maybe it's because a beautiful bag weighs every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kalllstadt
The Pfälzer procedures by Donald Trump came from a place called the inhabitants of the region.
This feature is also associated with the billionaire who wants to be President of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for climbers.
Whether he's out of the question, he's going to be a journalist or he's going to expose the consequences of the international crisis policy - the US President's candidate is making a strong effort to win the election.
And cut it out well.
This is also recorded in the Pfälzische Kalllstadt, where the capitals of the real estate billionaire are born.
The New Yorker with the Führer Führer is a term in the wine village.
Some of the 1200 residents are connected to him over -zig echoes.
His grandfather came from Kalllstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the election campaign mode.
The Kallstadter Simone Wendel was filming a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about their goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think those who find it somewhat exciting are not so deeply impressed in their call town type," says Simone Wendel.
In addition to Trump, the Kitchup family Heinz has produced an impressive documentary film about the place and its famous Springlings.
Trump, who is not known for intelligence, also comes to the word "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He didn't bring it to the king of hearts.
Although it gives respect for the family’s performance, but also tends to think that Trump “is already a bit of a big mule”, says Wendel.
In any event, the name of the peak, which has the call town around, "The Brulljesmacher" - to the German Highness: the offerer, she says.
That's why Trump comes from the village of the bidder.
The Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later Grandfather left and opened a place for gold miners in the United States.
The real estate company's foundation stone was the first real estate sale in New York.
However, the life of the elders was not free of tragedy: your desire to return to the home for a long time broke out in the state of Bavaria, which was then part of the Pfalz.
He didn't take Trump because he had just gone without permission, the director of the Institute for Pfálzic History and People's Science, Roland Paul, had explained to him at the beginning of the film.
Trump was the simple of a "lawful alien".
This is in contrast to the mid-marked statement of the follow-up.
He had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded that a border wall be built for illegal immigrants.
"As the poet, it's not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a remote connector Trump ("The Oma was a born trumpet, the Opa was born Heinz").
The winner in peace sees the Americans more distant, "he's always so excited."
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He's never been around Call City."
The pension wizard Veronika Schramm mentions how some call townrs say that a family of Heinz spent something for the church, which was generally good.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
She'd better get it if he didn't get the choice because "he has such radical views, I don't know if it's good."
If those who had said that at the time of his grandfather's in the United States would have been like him, "he'd never come there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzertochter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my President," she says.
And: "The widows will also be reifed without President Trump."
Wendell's film, which was long interviewed for the trumpet, has seen 12,000 filmmakers, and in the United States the interest is growing.
The Overseas Community of Ramsau at Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteiger village".
From the Vice-President at Deutsche Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-population village in the National Park Berchtesgaden received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria, there are already 20 "Bergstegerdörfer".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpenverein is responsible for the award.
A mountain village may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the evaluations, despite Nina's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at today's show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson moved to Canberra to report the loss of the liberal leadership, but it has not resulted in major changes in today's evaluations.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the German capital when Malcolm Turnbull created Tony Abbott's storm.
The Rival Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a weekly series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This part of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise achieved an average of 397,000 spectators in the five main cities, compared to today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase in rates for Monday (37,000) and last Tuesday (23,000), but its number remained after the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the jump to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
Until September, Sunrise stands at an average of 349.000 visitors to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change concern these people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are all right, thanks for checking!

The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently discovered father who decided to let himself and his two children down on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics wondered if Thomson could bring a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered with a clear "Yes".
The X-factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and easily defeated The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results at night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30 p.m.) of the new Quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, was averaged 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 till 18:00) jumped at 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot Seat (613.000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia 550,000 spectators arrived and in the second half of the second half, 720,000 were set.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The return to the quota of the second evening of The Chase Australia will probably agree that the hot-seat will finally be implemented at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is a substitute for millions of dollars minutes that didn't make it possible to fly over McGuires Show.

The last three votes agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret included? ...
Lana Yeavans-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Marcoski may have been undisputed who won The Bachelor.
The woman, who finally landed in Sam Wood in The Bachelor, was arrested in the largest secret case.
And not one of the three remaining girls will certainly not be rewarded if she is the one who received the last Rose.
But when we were with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jaavans-Fellows on the day before being checked out of three, you may have provided an indication of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips fixed until the end of Thursday
All three women have lyrically expressed themselves about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor, honor, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If you don't, who should get Woods last rose?" their answers could become gamers, who won the Bachelor's heart.
Jaavans-Fellows and Marcoski called them both fast - except themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other since the first day.
"From the moment I went home and (Sarahs) and Sam's energy was noticed, I was shocked that they were rather compatible, and I had thought about it all during the show," said Jaavans-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on the ground, it makes so much fun to be with her," added Marcoski.
I've seen them together, and they've got the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said the last week's visit made it clear that Wood could be "the One".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now unstintingly attached to him," she said.
And when she was asked, who would choose Wood if she didn't, she was right there.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the other girls alike - it's a difference between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be released on Wednesday, 19:30 p.m. on Tuesday.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his conversion to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent questions after his impressive open day of training last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and trainer Jim Tomsula and it looks like a bad decision.
Some coaches had tied Hayne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a set as much as it did the Ausie-Ruggby-Liga conversion at his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point return and also in the current game after a defeat of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the surrounding cabin after the game.
Instead of painting his rockets before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged her.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly at his press conference after the game.
The 49th sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who laughs at him to forget his lost catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fits at a point that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start, Hayne and his massive Australian success for his NFL-debt.
Hayne left after the Fumble flying the game field and later told the Australian radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine any worse start in his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happened now, you care only about the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the cutter with his original Debüt at the time in 2007, when a passport led to a trip to Queensland in its own in-Goal area.
However, it was a wonderful experience for the 27 years.
Hayne stood for a photo with fans and held an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of the schools
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian role field with gun guns.
After he had openly called out President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, his oil company Yukos was attacked, and his democratic efforts were underway.
The free voters demand the installation of 1,000 new teachers in Bayern due to high refugee numbers.
Party and Group Chief Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW-Herbst class in Großwallstadt before a severe crisis at Bayern's schools when there were no new teachers for many new students: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep the schools before the collapsing," Aiwanger said.
"As long as we get tenders in the Bavarian education system."
The daily group of free voters will be held in the French municipality by Friday.
In fact, there were other main topics.
But the refugee record is now also dominated by the free election.
"Of course, the theme Asyl will overlaise the clause," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger requested the establishment of UNO protection zones for refugees in Syria, as it was during the Yugoslavian war in the nineties.
"That's not how it goes, we need the reasons," said the Free Electoral Chief.
Retired asylum seekers want to expel the free voters as soon as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also requested more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum seekers," said Aiwanger.
The FW chief criticised that several German countries are not consistent: "We need federally uniform standards of the Germans."
"Bayern leaves, other people don't."
"That's what we have to do."
However, the country policy in Great Wall City should not fall under the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spain (CSU) launched the pilot test "middle level plus" at 47 Gymnasies, where an extension of the upper secondary level is tested for three to four years - then it takes nine years to assist.
But this isn't far enough for Aiwager.
"The G9 theme must be accelerated," said the FW chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all Gymnasies who want it.
Free drive at G9 wherever it is desired.

According to one trader, a positive report of the U.S. attorney magazine "Barron's" came after the weekend.
As a result, the employer paid too little attention to the German chip grower at the moment.
In this context, investment in future weapon technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid.

4 Killed after police shot Gummy shot at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot Gummicks in a crowd of people who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, said an officer on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, some of whom were throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used trains and then threw them into the air before they returned to rubber.
20 police and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the used rubber boots, known as those that could kill, but traditionally used as less lethal alternatives, apparently produced such a high rate of death.
The translation was the last week of violent protests in southern Nepal, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi said that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of Tharus who want a state.
At least 40 people, 11 of them police officers, have been in violent detention since the 10th.
August was killed when the four large political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process of destroying the earth which had killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators agreed this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu and said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.

Plans for holiday accommodation at the Small Sea at Emden are designed.
The investor first proposed public plans for the project.
Some investors are still concerned - they fear the sale of their free-time refugees
For months behind closed doors were negotiated, grabbed, debated and drawn.
Now there are plans for a new holiday home on the small sea near the edge of the table.
On Monday evening, the Central Emder Company "System-Build" presented its plans to the Emder Council's Committee on Urban Development for the first time.
This point had originally been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critic and the FDP Group, who challenged the investors and the management of secret armaments, Ralf Behrends of the System Building Management Board went to Offensive: "We have not yet answered all questions", he said to the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to deal with all the complaints now.
The EUR 10 to 12 million of your projects has been under discussion for months.
Heavy reactions under seafarers who came to the meeting called for images and new details on hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, owner of the seabed and member of the board of directors at the interest of the prosecutor, Pro Hieve, complains: "It will be a huge castle which is overrun by all other buildings".
In addition, he fears as many other project critics that transport would increase by the planned size of the facility: "All bus charges must come to account for this," said Schulz.
However, what happens in the good area of the former guesthouse is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"First we have to have a closed concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans were still variable.
Zwillings-increasing in Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo rejoices over the growth of its Gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian brought zwillings to the world yesterday.
Billing births are rare in Gorillas.
The last in a German Zoo is almost 50 years back and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, called the Zoo.
The sex of newborn gorilla volunteers is not yet established, since Mother Dian keeps her in close contact with the body.
First he reported the "image".
NHC says 60 percent chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurrine Center said a wide depth system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance to develop into a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined deep-pressure system, about the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and small islands, also has a 60-percent potential to create a tropical hurricane in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google starts double-spending campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double-spend campaign that would cost $11 million for humanitarian organizations, which would help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations as they fled the war and fled devastated countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach to the announcement of the payment call on his blog.
Instead of allowing an manager to make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google worker who had fled from Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"In our journey many dark roads and buses, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperate for help.
The funds are made available to four joint organizations providing assistance for refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global collected expenditure up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugee life will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has devastated more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, which were devastated by the war.

For mildly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether mildly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote a lead article to the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or adiposat surgery use different methods to reduce the size of the magic.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, Adipositas operations have proved to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are sickly with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in relation to size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is too important, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered fat.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they collected in a study since 2007 and compared two types of Adipositas surgery - Magenbypass and Magnup Training - to medical treatments for type-2 diabetes in humans who were easily overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
At the same time, BMI remained approximately the same in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatment at 29.
Among those who were prevented from having surgery, 36 % of the diabetes was fully resolved and 28 % partially.
In the medical-treated group, diabetes was completely resolved by only one percent and by only about two percent.
In addition, the results of controls on blood pressure, triglyceride and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "more generally in the 'surgery' group", the authors found out.
Researchers also monitor the patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflect blood sugar levels over time.
Haemoglobin A1c will be kept at least 7 percent, says researchers.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
However, in the medical treatment group it remained stable by about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as you reflect in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce the mortality in five years, so led researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compares average results with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrictomy group (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), achieved greater relapses in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs 2.1%) and rather recorded a complete excess of diabetes (46.9% vs 16.7%).
While the new study does not show any survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of severe people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, there were poor people who refused an adiposat operation to die about 29 per cent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared with a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any benefit for survival in the surgical patients, Blackstone said it was comforting for people with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because she says this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, without increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have collected these genetic changes that have been closely connected with fatty and diabetes, a transformation is really difficult."
Love Story Plays in the Heart
It is a topic that is now being increasingly observed in Belletistics: A young woman, at school, is unloved and unsightly, encounters the shadow of her youth after years, and she loves it.
So in a recent novel "We're not really like this" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love story, the Romans must be particularly interested in Hunsrücker's readers because he plays in Langweiler and the surrounding communities.
The main author is raised in Langweiler and is pleased that she could place a literal memory in her home.
"It's impossible that everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not include all refugees, said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis was in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama discussed the problem of the continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech about the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethical studies.
He requested that the interests of mankind be placed in front of the interests of individual nations or even continents under these circumstances.
He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is remarkable, but the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Despite the efforts of Dalai Lama Germany and Austria to address the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To care for thousands of refugees, it is wonderful, but in the meantime you must think about long-term solutions, such as true peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama discussed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack of 11 September and pointed out that the violent reaction of the United States was a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September I expressed my opinion in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is inexhaustible.
"I know his motives were good, but he introduced violence, and that has had unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the intake of hand infections by children in the last 4 years
Drug control centres in the United States reported an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who have high alcoholic hand infection, says the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of seizures of hand infections in children under 12 years of age reported by the poison control centres increased from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them go into emergency arrest," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink anti-infective drugs, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a courage test in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how to drink adolescent disinfectants only because of an accurate experience.
Young people have reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol-containing water to get a stronger drink.
Young children can be accessed from attractive depth of the disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think it's bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the attractive (hand disinfectants) are those who are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grapefruit and orange juice, which are very suitable for children.
Hand-infection products contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
In particular in young children, there may already be few drinkers leading to alcohol consumption.
"It's the highest concentration of alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Center for Disease Control at the hospital of the University of Kansas, the sender Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn't let any luck Whisky out here, but people let these hand disinfectants in the range of children, and if children come from it, then it's a quick opportunity to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four syringes from after her husband had contracted toxic hand infection in school, was taken to emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than that of the swall that is legally used in adults, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, a non-inflammation doctor who treated her outside of Atlanta in the gainnett Medical Center.
Nhaijah cried her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency.
Doctors watched them at a separate hospital at night on signs of brain trauma, since the girl had fallen by alcohol and had knocked her head off, Ritchey said.
"That was very embarrassing," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and store hand-infections outside the child’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with fatalities.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario women after the use of hand-infective agents that included a toxic, undeclared drug.
Health authorities believe that the product contains methanol, a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which has been noted as an active substance.
In January three students of the fourth class in New York State planned to teach their "common" teacher by explaining antibacterial products around the classroom," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand-infectives and connected her from her room.
The police considered the proposed plan "gish language" and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authorities.
Vallingen-swings: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old car driver has been slightly injured in an accident on the north-east coast.
A 60-year-old truck driver traveled across the Querspane in the direction of cross-road transport industry, and it was too late to believe that there were two ahead-of-road vehicles on the rail transport.
As a result, he drove his truck into the back of an audition and drove this vehicle to a stand-alone Ford Fiesta.
On the unmanned vehicles, damages of about 10,000 euros were caused by the police.
The 33-year-old audition was no longer ready and had to be completed.
Smoking: No Disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays the tool of Disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila suggests that the Hopes are in a bad place, but that he will still use it.
Hearts will fight SFA due to the charge of Neilson and Warburton will be cautious of new obligations that could destroy the unit of the framework
Dos raise direction over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half gave Aberdeen a short victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the Dons would create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays gear over Disharmony below
There are reports of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was rejected by Griffiths spontaneously. This included that he and his men were not under increased control as they were prepared to face the Dutch Table Leader.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are happy about it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football long-term Netherlands - de Boer
The former Rangers field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title rival with the Rangers.
De Boer, now a messenger for Ajax, said: "In Holland they don't show any heights of Celtic games anymore, and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here don't just talk about the turn of Rangers.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the old firm games, and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn things around, Deila says.
Ronny Deila has accepted that Celtic has to fight, but the Norwegian chief has a hard time turning things around.
After the landing against Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League, the landing was followed by 10 men from Aberdeen, who are now on the top of the table with five points of origin.
Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll come back."
Now we want to get out as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's going on.
We feel that way - but we have to go on.
We really need Celtic support because it makes players better.
It's so important to meet now.
Warburton carefully at January-Transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he was calling for some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful to sign up for new arrivals and must not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox framework.
The former Chief of Brentford said: "The January Transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The crew is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with return instructions
Swansea-Stormer Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in the conversation, has indicated that he could return when his contract runs out at the Swans.
The 29-year-old has been married with an empty knife for two years and has not been able to escape from Wales in this summer.
Hearts on SFA battle for Neilsons comments
The hearts led 2:1, when Patterson was sent out from the field and then lost 3:2, but the defendant's red card was later raised - the third red card of Collum, which was rejected in eight months.
Neilson remains in what he has said and insists: "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths vow to avoid Tynecastle
The unfavourable hippie was justified after he gave a song with striking lyrics about ex-hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The event took place in a Kneipe in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the stormer and added, "it's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle if it's not playing for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board Trusts in Dundee-United Management
Simon Donnelly insists that the board of Dundee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but that the downturn must end in the field.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to bring the boys back to Trab," said Donnelly.
McInnes was delighted to "wine to win" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes points out that his team from Aberdeen had to fight against Hamilton Accies to see a seven-fold successive league victory that led them to five points before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half.
McInnes said, "There is no man who has won everything in poker games or leagues that have never won this kind of game."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it increases in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged between May and July, while the number of people unemployed for the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent exceeded the UK by 5.5 per cent, as shown by the figures of the National Statistics Office (ONS).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by about 12,000 over the three months, with the number of employees now at 2.612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell by 74.0 per cent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The State Secretary for Scotland, David Mundell, commented on the latest figures and said: "The long-term government plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.
The disturbances interrupted the run
As the security staff could not satisfy the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of Pfeffer spray could the officers take the stress in danger.
At 16 years of age, an atomic carbon test resulted in 0.89 promille.

Why I'll be a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I'll see how a man is brought to death.
If it happens and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a watch gallery in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison spray.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January on his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I began to fear.
So why should I?
I voted because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is agreed that journalists can see advertisements in the United States, and since there are often more applications than places available, there is a lotteries instead to decide who will be selected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five.
Those who are selected will be observed without emotion.
I can't do that.
I'll sit next to Richard Glossips as a close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephones and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a note book and a stick to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of giving up my privacy on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story how he wants it, and you will get access.
I complained to her.
She thought she'd "be able to make it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did it.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter present to write there.
If he dies, he thinks that the public work of the movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say with confidence that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his direction is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can use for.
What you get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
A man crossed the cold police chase to come from the Canning River
The Canning Vale cop remained dry when he crossed the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to quit the police was successful when he was in the sixth and sixth waters, only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "slowly overcome him to return to the river."
On Tuesday, the police from Canning Valley were called into a housebreak case in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspects, they tried to get them off the Canning River.
But he didn't get far away.
"He stood in the water and said 'I don't come out, come and get me,' said Senior Sergeant Schhandl Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perahac was not too interested in making his uniforms, so he turned to a more reliable tactic - "A good cop treated".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Master's football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the grave to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were successful, but inspired natives to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousin-Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewarts tried to spy on him and dares to finish the race
Peter Moody claims that Stewarts from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his premises last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late scraping due to a rental treatment, the last stroke on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for the race and he had found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive Cobalt top trial at Lidaris which he could not explain.
He had been back for 18 months because of spying and didn't want it to be "excessive as high-fashioned holes."
"I didn't mean to say anything about it, and I've been talking about it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know it's going on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to turn proud heads around, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking, I don't do it, then I shouldn't be a trainer anymore.
Then I have to consider what I'm doing with my license.
Before Moody had raised the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy out its steel.
"Fourty months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart entered a room with a man - the one I'll name when I'm asked - and offered him a job in my place to provide information about what I'm doing inside my place," said Moody on Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should probably stick to their nose because they failed to catch me when they tried to catch me.
Robert Roulston, husband. President of the RVL, David Moodie, Acting President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of it at this time and are still today.
Should that make me think it's gonna be personal?
Did the RVL behave well and maybe people outside coaches are responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they have to take my license and get rid of me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now lets them think about it.
But now I'm at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I'll exercise pressure on them and force them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The trainer's Frustration Levels have been built with the long-standing Cobalt Research at Lidari, and late Scratching led to saying that he could "have his license on the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the unsuspecting Master Black Caviar, referred to the running-day treatment rule as "slow", after a package of slamm or tone was placed on the horse legs, which was interpreted as contrary to the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees accidentally pushed his leg on.
It could have been like this last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday.
But it was the same on the rent day.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the package on the X-ray. A study on this subject was opened.
It's a white one.
People who make these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here's where one goes too far," said Moody.
Man arrested after driving
On the weekend, the police arrested a man after a meeting with a driver and a subsequent driver in Cobram.
The driver was introduced to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with the hip surgeon after he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday a 50-year-old man from Nathalia of the police in Shepparton was present.
It is expected to be charged for driving and under-service and other transport costs.
The driver, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy hits rival rivals because of claims to fight ring back
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy named Critik at the top of his player's "Agenda-setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the judge had allowed the storm players "ring fight" with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a rather vague comment to the Storm Team after his team had won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday. He called the game a "model example" of Rugby League and said that the two of Queensland were not "too" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the gratitude of his men and said that she was only focused on her "Contact" at the Tacling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers of his team would undoubtedly agree with him because it meant that they were worried about being hit by the storm team.
"It's always getting up again - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fights when they hit us at 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and this has brought us the trend.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he's obviously got to train a great man. So he's probably not used to losing it, so it was a little shock for him.
It is already funny how this has always been reflected in this year.
Bellamy touched Bennets' idea by the "frequencyful football" and reminded his mentor that Bennets St George Illawarra Dragons won the "long-term" football prize in 2010.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday with our on Friday evening and how exciting her game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was criticized as a long-term team, and Wayne said he was going to take care of himself.
But now he has a team that can play and we view it as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think about us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also showed that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it a exciting game?
Or are there breaks and no points of interest?
It's the game plans for me.
If they mention us, it means that we will still meet them in a phase.
The Storm team is free on this weekend because they have won the right to receive both North Queensland Cowboys or the Chronulla Sharks on the next Saturday in the preliminary AAMI park. The ticket sale starts from the next Tuesday morning.
Serbia with $200,000 punishment for drug charges
A man who may have a life-long penalty for his attempt to get possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine that were smuggled into Queensland was released against a fine of $200,000.
Marco Maximovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drugs on Yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and took place in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was observed seeing his mitangling camp during the morning and later in the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible life-long penalty for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, the lawyer of Maximovic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that it could have been in the cafe for a rough reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flalangan, was concerned about the risk of flight at Maximovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the crime, he accused the police of his place of residence.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had offered 200,000 dollars as security together in order to achieve his release.
"After reading the statements of the two persons, it is clear that the security burden of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," said Richter Flanagan.
But this alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maximovic was released against execution under conditions that he gave up his Australian and Serbian passport, reported to the police every day and held to an exit stop from 18:00-06:00.
An accident on A5 in Karlsruhe: Guide House is moving apart
A truck driver was seriously injured on the day of duty in a car accident with three trucks on the road 5 at Karlsruhe.
Two of the three vehicles involved had crashed before a permanent building in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried to move to the left at the last moment, as the police reported.
The leadership of the accident victim is completely at odds.
The driver was severely injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-North was completely closed over six hours to 2 hours.
There was a damage of EUR 122.000.
Stefan Hogg used the phone of girls to lock pádophile to send images
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to demand images of child abuse.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone when this letter entered an online messageing service from which he received a number of independent images from children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusing messages and alarmed her mother immediately.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "relevant" Web research using concepts for looking for unusable images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officers that he had done it because it was "to lead a pedophile on the Internet" and then "to be a cop to scare her".
State lawyer Eilyh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be a search - that he was eager to scare people.
He claimed that his computer search was carried out, but he said it was because he wanted to be a cop to scare the pádophile.
He was asked after his conversation with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to lock her up.
He said he was sick in his head when he drank, and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was on the roof and on the wine.
She also saw the innocent images on the phone and faced the defendant with it.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and play station used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the complaint to have taken undeterred images of children on 14 June last year, to be beaten against the charges on 25 January of this year and not before court to be heard on 24 March of this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg do not appear in the register of sexual offenders, since it could be argued that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his absence.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael sent the sentence to October to obtain background reports on social work.
In this case, Hogg was sentenced, but because of hearings of other still outstanding cases, he was held in court of inquiry.
He was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the trial.
Lockers wet on small border rooms in Germany
More and more refugees are being caught away from the main points of control at the German-Austrian border.
Many lockers left fear before detection and arrest increase people on smaller border crossings
on the Austrian side, a German-police speaker said.
Along the border river Inn, more than 1,000 refugees have been arrested in the rural areas of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They were on foot through bridges and stauwehres on the German side.
There they are taken into custody by federal police and continued to be registered.
At Munich's main train station, there were a lot more refugees than at the beginning of the week.
Only until 8:00 a.m., about 700 people arrived in the capital city, one speaker said in the morning.
After the re-entry of checks at the German-Austrian border, on Tuesday 1759 refugees reached the city.
Stuttgart: Tropensturm "Henry" is expected in the south-west
Meteorologists warn against storms in the south-west of Wednesday.
Because of a deep-pressure area across Western Europe, hot sea air flows into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) shared in Stuttgart.
The strong depth was the runner of the "Henry" troupe storm, which had been driven over the Atlantic by the Bermuda Islands in the past days.
Heavy storms and weather are expected in particular in Baden.
According to DWD, up to Thursday morning is also to be counted in the Black Forest, on the Swiss Alb and on the bottom of the lake with bays from 60 to 90 hours.
On Friday, then, the sun can be re-examined.
The mass makes's: every two years the car manufacturers show their news to the IAA.
In particular, 2015 is to be recorded in the compact vehicles which are currently sold especially well.
Cars from the compact class are currently specifically asked: around 28.1 percent of the new authorisations are issued according to the Department of Transport (KBA) only in August on this segment.
This is also reflected on IAA (public day 17 to 27 September).
Among all future design vehicles and new superclasses and luxury designs are presented in this year, in particular many new compact models.
One of the largest premiums for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be held in autumn at the hands of the dealers.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel Chief Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
He belongs to the core of the brand.
In order to sell the volume model well, the new Astra should also not become much more expensive.
Opel provides an entry under the largest VW Golf competitor, which starts at EUR 17,650.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra has a new 1.4 litre engine with 74 kW/100 PS.
In addition, the horses also offer diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW/200 PS, which include three cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, there is the Opel Astra only as five.
As the second variant will follow in the spring of the Combi, which is also to be seen on the IAA.
And what's going to be done next to the astra on the IAA for new compact machines?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitors Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane is only seen as a fifther in a conventional and emphasised GT version.
In trade, he'll start next year, then also as acombi.
Infiniti: All new in the segment is Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan Abbeyer wants to find his position with the new model in the highly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti with its swinging lines fits completely into the design line of the brand.
The bassimodell will receive a petrol engine with a performance of at least 90 kW/122 PS.
However, there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates its world prize in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1,0 liter turbo engine and a performance of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum torque is based on manufacturer inputs at 170 Newtonmeters (Nm).
The start of the sale of Balenno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but around it is the compact class model DS 4, which is to be seen on the IAA.
In addition, the designers of the famous Citroën-Aleger pointed out, above all, to the front: here the cooling grid was redesigned and the modified scanners were equipped with LED technology.
In the inside room, the information system has been modernized, reduced the number of buttons by a touchscreen and integrated for the first time into Apples CarPlay.
In addition, a number of processes and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are dedicated to the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters cells are human-deterred
The Federal Constitutional Court granted a former prisoner of the law enforcement agency Tegel, who was subjected to months in a small cell.
As a result of the damage to their human dignity, prisoners have essentially claimed financial damage if they are exposed to too little cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
The judges concerned could even hope for money if they had been locked up in the five rooms for only a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
As a result, an ex-priced prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: he was placed in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 in the Berlin-Tegel court; the toilet was not spaced.
Then the man who, according to his lawyer's instructions, was again on a free foot was moved into a larger cell.
His arrest warrants for the unwarranted conditions against the country of Berlin.
However, the Constitutional Court upheld the Court's judgment in Berlin and indicated the case for re-examination there.
They see the human worth of man being damaged.
The Court of First Instance now decides on the amount of damage
Even if for legal reasons only a few days were necessary for the damage, if a claim was made, it did.
Otherwise it would be "to fear a threat to the legal protection of personality".
The Chamber must now clarify the amount of money damage.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
This is how they speak to a prisoner in April because he was locked up in a cell.
Human dignity is also a result of a decision of 2011 that also leads to the multiphase of a cell without separate toilets.
In addition, Karlsruhe confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court in mid-week, which in November 2009, a prisoner in a parallel case had proved to be inhumane.
The plaintiff was subjected to three months on a daily basis between 15 and 21 hours in a same cell as in the Karlsruyer case.
In recent weeks the Berlin Prisons have also come to the battle lines because of missing personnel.
As a result, they will be arrested again and again for 23 hours, which increases aggressiveness, even if it is due to injuries.
After the release of the justice system, 21 jobs in Tegel are not employed because of lack of employment, 19 are due to disappear in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We're creating this"
The migration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor has decided to adopt them.
What's going on in Germany?
About 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year according to estimates by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to the statement of Vikänzler Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to include a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated its resolve in view of the extraordinary challenge: "I say again and again: We can create it and we can create it."
What happens in Germany is the following overview.
According to various forecasts, between 350000 (estimation of the Federal Ministry of Woods) and 4000000 (estimation of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - and for the next five years.
This is almost doubled as much as it has been built so far (250,000 apartments).
The lack of living space is dramatic, but especially for affordable rental facilities: 60,000 to 80,000 social apartments fall out of the rent price chain annually, and these especially affordable apartments will also be eligible for refugees.
The Federal Ministry of construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) is therefore seeking to double the promotion, from 518 million to one billion euros.
This is too small from the viewpoint of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing needs to be created annually and the federal had to invest a promotion of 6.4 billion each year.
Some of them are scientists and Federal Ministry of Agriculture that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, 55% of refugees can be employed in Germany for a long time.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically for their qualifications to help them get in, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees to find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for valuation in the recording company, but also for the self-esteem of migrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Tränhardt.
In Germany, according to Drährardt, it has given a political turn: the ban on work for refugees to recognize work.
While there was a ban on work for asylum seekers for up to five years earlier, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residence obligation restricted to asylum seekers.
In the company, because of the lack of expertise, most of the way refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
There is a lack of German knowledge for access to the labour market.
So far there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that workplaces are mostly transmitted by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore based on the view of Thränhardt of the Royal Road for labour integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to the kitas, estimated 10 to 15 percent: "It is only very important for the divorced parents to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschenmbar, speakers for young people and families in the Berlin Senate administration.
To convince the family of the benefits of Kita, the administration distributes manuals in different languages.
If the need for educators is to be strong through the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - perhaps by allowing more schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge are prepared for education in Welcome Classes.
But they are not always taught by well-educated teachers and teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a secondary language.
They have no lack, says Beate Materials from the Berlin School Administration.
The German student work estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no German asylum seekers or sufferers are presenting the study - the only exception was until Berlin, Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Student volunteers could facilitate access to the university.
Because refugees with a residence permit or debt will no longer receive benefits under the asylum application law when they start a study.
In principle, the latter do not receive any benefits, since they do not fall within the circle of eligible persons.
Long-term refugees had to live in Germany for up to four years to be entitled to baffeg from 1 January 2016 to reduce the tension by 15 months.
These funding opportunities must also be closed, however, called for Stephen Krach, Berlin State Secretary for Science and the German Student Network.
The students should get immediate addition.
Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The State should successfully ensure that Islam has the same rights as the churches, and that the existing State Church law continues to develop a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare bond that is professionally concerned about the new generation.
The rights also include obligations.
In this way, the representatives of Islam must join clear communication partners and be willing to work with the State in many areas and allow him certain control options.
This includes preparation, control against religious fundamentalism.
The President of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazeek, excluded on Thursday the concerns, religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany.
Those who wanted to bring such conflicts out in Germany "have immediately had their right to rest here in Germany," he said in the Bavarian Roundfunk.
He proposed to translate the basic law into Arabic.
Integration will be much more in the future than it is today.
In order to change the majority society too, the elimination of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Germany has, indeed, been the result of European decisions since a few decades of anti-discrimination and general equality law.
However, it is very slow to learn how the NSU murder series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored racist motives.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and interest groups are not aware of in Germany for a long time and what international agreements such as the Anti-Terrorism Convention for Germany have to be fulfilled in the next few years if the country remains at peace and its new citizens should take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany was able to provide medical care for the expected refugees, my doctor, Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man-power and capacity are concerned, we will create it," he said to the daily mirror.
However, additional money must be transferred into the system.
In order to avoid seizures, Montgomery asks all relatives to hand out health cards at the same time when registering.
The resulting benefits could later be calculated with the German countries.
And for a long time it would be most questionable to eat so many people with the limited service catalogue provided for by the Asylum Services Act.
In particular, doctors should create language barriers.
In the past, the Berlin Health Science Thea Borde has proved that migrants are worse informed of their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practice, dolmets should be taken into account, she asks.
Many refugees would also be helped with more general medical operations in emergency clinics.
And with another diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, there are a lot more problems that are not treated, and for young people it is about HIV clearance.
With the other patients, however, German doctors came from their training, which means Montgomery.
"Parastin or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize." And as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, it is possible for refugees to see relief.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, some refugees were even doctors.
In order to practice, however, they must demonstrate their qualifications and carry out tests as soon as possible.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates of the Federal Psychotherapy Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
They are particularly vulnerable to refugees, explains Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study published by TU Munich suggests that every five Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with asthma, dizziness, heart attacks and deaths.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe chest stiffness and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent symptoms from occurring chronically, an early treatment is necessary, muz explained.
Until now, however, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
While mental health-care professionals may apply for psychotherapy in the social areas, treatment usually lasts for several months.
In addition, most experts or doctors in the social areas who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misappropriations, says Munz.
Many invite you to dream
With the new insinuation of "Landness" the Circus probst takes back to the customs of the circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the band of fascinating acrobatics, animal addresses and one-time entertainment.
Now the Circus sample is invited into the manage on the bridge to sleep.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior chef.
"Sorry" - under this motto is the current manoeuvre.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family of probst.
The gift to the pet is therefore in the blood.
"It is important for us to get people out of their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours," says the 27-year-old Junior Chef.
"Manegencocktail with Worldstadt-Flair," said Director Reinhard Probst his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 km long tour can now experience this Flair.
The program of the circus is convinced by talented artists from all over the world.
The Russian Stoliarov Cloud Family is outstanding at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, which attracts the public with white and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their work.
With the hero of the stem film it wants to take over the Cuban duo locker.
Lightness and mobility - they identify themselves with these words.
Your humorous art on the mast is to overcome women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous lax salvens, the acrobatics of the Circus test also fascinated with the feeling of fingers and ties.
Balancing on a ball?
For He Yuan there's no problem.
Fascinating and scarring people at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is entrusted with the oldest form of acrobatics as few others and fascinated with its mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," stressed Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Provst.
Mistakes in the behaviour of circus animals are just too often the subject of various animal protection organisations.
Stephanie Probst also takes the view: "It's not good for our animals, it's not good for us either".
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.
The "four-footed artists", as they are called in love, will be read as soon as possible from the eyes.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
The animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to be in the mood either.
So the ultimate offer: take good care of the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture from a Shetland Ponyhengst and a zebrastute, the family is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a cave and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," Brigitte said.
The zebra is not ready for the manage yet, but for this it is the unique mascot of the Circus sample.
So for every visitor there must be something.
"One thing is safe," says Stephanie Provst, "any matter of five or 1,200 spectators, we always give our best and are with all our heart."
From 17 to 20 September, the Circus Test is invited to its presentations every 17 and 20 hours.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 and 16 hours.
Thursday is a family day, the prices are modest for the 17-hour show.
In addition, the animal shoes are open every day from 10 to 18 hours.
Simbabwes Robert Mugabe has made a mistake in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell from a podium below the stairs at the beginning of the year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also challenged by the allegations of opposition officials that they had received anonymous threats of death and were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's complaint with appeals.
In the past month, they had excommunicated him and interrupted him during his talk on the position of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonesse said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones, which warned them to break Mr. Mugabe's response.
"The message comes from a number that is not shown, but it has the title 'Death'," he said after Mugabes told reporters.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity will end in Parliament and that their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective as soon as they leave Parliament.
The main speaker said that the party led by Morgan Tsvanggui was "careful" about the risks to politicians.
Hewlett Packard will be up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett Packard is expected to be reduced to 25,000 to 30,000 jobs under restructuring and savings efforts in the company's services.
HP will be divided into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing company hardware and its services.
The expected standoff cost is over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, says HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard company," said Meg Whitman, HP President and Chief Executive, who should lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today, and we have a broad and verifiable portfolio of businesses supporting companies in transition into a new business style," said Whitman.
As their own companies, we are better prepared than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion annually and "will be concentrated on the provision of less efficient, integrated technology solutions for companies", says a company's statement.
It is distributed by a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to build electrical installations called the Palo Alto Garage "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley".
HP has passed a massive restructuring to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies, is the newest in this area based on the conviction that a focused company will deliver a better performance.
FC Arsenal-Captain Michael Arteta says teammates must stand in front of the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the last Jack Willsher
Wenger stressed against Willsher that it was first September and that if his rehabilitation runs according to the plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that at least the next four games for England will certainly be missed by Willesher, and in view of his history his participation in the next summer of the European Championship is still uncertain.
The great shame of this current problem is that Willsher had stopped the last season after a separate bone damage and then recovered to his old scar during the preseason.
"This kind of damage does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that doesn't heal well.
This is not a bigger issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not associated with his bones or the injuries he had suffered before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the risk of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Willesher since his debout six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five times.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League Clubs in six of eight games since 2007/08, which have been most likely to record damage days.
Weger accepts the potential of a Devil race, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you get back from a loss, you have a random period, a time when you have to strengthen your body and gain battle force," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to overcome it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he'll do it and he'll run a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his championship league season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on the next Wednesday, and Wenger sets up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey are not traveling to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and the players who need to take a little break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is clear in favour of continuing through Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is part of the games with the greatest impact on Europe.
Dynamo has also been unsuccessful after 41 games since the "impossible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was hit by a quake on Tuesday night, where 3,2 were measured on the rector scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has taken the lessons from the previous season with the Champions League capitalisation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the union with his management to his first Europeanpocal triumph.
"This movement is immeasurable," said Wenger.
It's never complained about Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We're proud, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the Comedy Show, which gives us serious lessons about men's friendship
The lack of similar performances in Shows is obvious, especially in view of how men need to open up, even more so than before, how suicide among young men has proved to be a 15-year-old high.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men between the ages of 20 and 45 in Britain, and it remained three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserrably (CALM - Campaign against a
Friendship is the key to mastering this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of spiritually healthy friends shares the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you need to have friends only once in order to make a friendship work.
In the time of social media communication, focusing on the style of substance, the immediateness of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital life has the need to appear, strong, vital and successful, double, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, everything at the cost of internal values - our internal view of personal development and friendship, which has a profound impact on our spiritual health.
And as a video player and billionaire recently explained, money cannot really buy happiness.
The nice thing with friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Not every character was defined by its work, but by its personality, which was clearly defined by the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler is often characterized by moods, moments during football in comfortable sexes and the search for pink to Rachel - all of this comes from the knowledge that men can relate to each case, even if they often hold back, to fully explore their feelings.
As a telephone care worker explained to me: "My hearing role for people who feel depressed and who are at risk of suicide has really shown me how to make a difference even the smallest interactions of friends."
The men who contact us often don't feel able to talk to friends.
The old term "I come right here" has a huge effect, such as the feeling that it will be taken as a weakness when you talk about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that makes me feel like I'm trying to offer longer-term treatment mechanisms.
It presents quite clearly the small moments of men's friendship.
So much my objective external status on the phone can also help people in the face of confusion, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend Comedy Central FriendsFest with the totally new Christmas dress for the day, why don't you take your friends to a drink in Central Park?
Or even better if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the total of 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
You're going to meet Maria to help PSG to swallow malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matudi and Edinson Cavani after his encounter with Malmo.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the League Championships on Tuesday and helps PSG to prevent malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took the course as Paris Saint-German champions League Season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prince Park stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champion's League Debuts as a PSG player who led the French master on the way, but then she missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing her origin, as Cavani achieved a headballtor in 61 minutes.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk in Group A, Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish master, as they not only seek qualifications for the K.O. rounds, but also an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But as they got the points, there was no class game by Laurent Blancs team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics. He later changed in the game against his home city team and the association with which he started his illusory career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win home or abroad in the Champions League. Therefore, it is a good start to win 2:0 to get back our opponent problems and to look back calmly, even if there are certain things we need to improve during the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, even though I'm afraid we haven't reached one or two other gates."
Ibrahimovic returned after his defeat in one of three changes to the Paris team, which was able to hold a 2:2 divorce on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was expelled in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine flight stormer was named as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month, and he pointed out why when he entered Marco Verratis Pass after Malmo's confirmation before he passed through the long corner of the network with Johan Willan.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who fought Celtic in a play-off to achieve this level, joined in an amphitheater with nine national players in the field and was with a five-man conviction and two deep in the middle field was running a difficult opponent.
But besides an explosion by Nikola Djurdjic, who was far away from Kevin Trapps Pphosten in the 34 minutes of advance, they were slightly attacked.
On the contrary, PSG himself at times, with some failures and bad conclusions, did not end up with Ibrahimovic, who, in no less than five trials alone in the first half and then was released after Cavani used it after the reboot.
Nevertheless, he proved much more news when he brought his players into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, who turned Di Maria into a drawer, which was predicted by Willand in the 52th minute on the foot ...
The second tower finally fell shortly after the hour mark, thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayans achieved his sixth season, after Ibrahimovic had set up a left branch of Maxwell.
This ended all the thought that Malmö could get back into the game, and only a great effort by Willan from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final outcome low before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi realized a tower at the end.
The trainer of Malmö, Age Hareide, later said that PSG played a class about his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Championship League game was in December last year.
Since then we have only played in the Swedish League which has not had the same level.
The qualification games are not enough."
Get out of front of Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion by selling shares
The mountain-building rice Glencore in Switzerland, which is affected by rising raw materials prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a sale of shares as part of its huge debt plan.
The company Glencore, registered in London, said in a statement that it sold new shares at the value of approximately 1.6 billion euros to pay its own debts.

The share jumped by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 Index, which opened 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had announced the last week the $2.5 billion share sale as part of the more comprehensive plan to charge around a third of its $30 billion debt.

The White House confirms Xi Jinpings Visit to Washington
The Chinese president Xi Jinping will make a state visit in the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the white house in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xis first official in Washington, will take place on 25 September and welcomes President Barack Obamas' trip to Beijing last November, the statesman said.
The U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also be guests of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state diner after the two heads of state have held bilateral talks this evening.
"The President Xis visit will offer the opportunity to extend American-Chinese cooperation in a number of global, regional and bilateral topics of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to develop areas of opinion constructively," adds the State.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola stopped 2008 Switching to FC Bayern
World and European Master Xavi has been playing since summer 2015 for the Al-Sadd Sports Club in Qatar
The FC Bayern was apparently a few years ago shortly before the Spanish Superstar Xavi, who was playing for the FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish Master, three times Pocal winner, four times Champions League winner, two times Club World Master, two times European Master, one time World Master - the title list of Xavi is exciting.
In the summer the average 35-year-old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
However, in an interview with Marca Xavi now tells us that he was already before the EM 2008 before the Barcelona decision.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at the time, we didn't do anything," he says.
And it also registered the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was a offer from Bayern."
"Romemenge wanted me."
In summer 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change didn't happen.
And the exhilarating man today works for the German record teacher: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça has taken Guardiola under contract and I have played a great EM."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the man without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's game time 2008/2009 would run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca at the fourth end of the Champions League against the Bayern over the entire distance on the race, turned off the red (4:0, 1:1) and finally celebrated the king-class triumph.
Matt Damon plays many in the movies below
Matt Damon faced the Afro-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she would not be needed behind the scenes.
During a follow-up to Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced player Brown stressed the need for alternative perspectives and stressed the need for a black protagonist in the selected drivebook of the project.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it when the film is occupied and not when the show is occupied," Damon assured.
Brown responded shocked, with a slight disbelief and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments of the player of The Martin were confirmed.
Damon and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of harmony," Brown first said.
The only black person, and she is a benefit that will be struck by her white guardian.
The producer of Dear White People set himself up for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancacio for the rights of the government in the film; Damon claimed that their government "may eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before disclaiming about Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni printed his voice over the clip by writing "Matt Damon speaks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - this is SO WEISS that it does."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 websites and 4,000 likes since its publication.
Damon's comments come at a time when exactly racial representation is in the media at the top of the social discussion.
Following the death of teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer in 2014, the movement Black Lives Matter achieved a country-wide effect and forced legislators and authorities to provide discriminatory practices against colour content.
In February, the singer Prince performed a show on the movement during the introduction of the famous albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still remain subject," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
In recent times, leaders of the movement Black Lives Matter have published an explanation and how the group should be viewed as a group of hass, in response to the question of Fox-News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," said the leader.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and mediamodules invited to visit the pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or already met the pope, it is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' won the first champion
Profi sports clubs and service assistant Isaac Caldiero was the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the great price of $1 million with home.
The competition show, which just ended its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all the stages of its barrier course.
During the season, there were two men, Caldiero and Cameramann Geoff Britten, until the final.
For the last task, the climber belonged to a 75 foot long string in 30 seconds.
Britain completed the task within the time when he was the first athlete to complete the effort phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero completed this challenge three seconds earlier, which made him more successful.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard fight, still under the shock of winning the great price of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," said Isaac E! about his wallet money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The lead producer Kent Weed set up with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britts, although he was the first to finish the race, does not receive any prizes.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it will get that with the fastest time," said Weed.
As much money is a wonderful price and life changes, it gets great graffiti.
I don't think he's going to have any trouble about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received lots of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be killed by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had changed their roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended to an eighth stage, which will begin in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers hit Minnesota Twins over
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
They were once one of the best teams in Baseball, today the Tigers are at the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as sponsors, but on Tuesday this party played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the target field.
The Twins lost a chance to climb within a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard Square.
For Detroit, although only for one night, it was a return of the three letters F-word, which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"Every victory makes fun of it, whatever it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Usmus.
Tiger-Pitch Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the bottom.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and enabled three runs.
It was his third successful start in his last nine parties.
"I want to end this year very much," said Simon.
It's hard to shoot in the balls every game, and that's why I want to concentrate completely on the game.
The designer Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three encounters and was in two runs, his first RBI since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He's got a good push," said Ausmus.
He looked well out of the battle training, looked much better out of the bubbles, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three rounds at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a point, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to strike out before he was replaced by Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived the wall, the only man he faced, before the designed Rokie-Schlagmann Miguel Sano, who entered a two-run two-way drive.
With a couple of runners and the final run at the second trial, the third baseman Trevor Pluffe brought to a double game.
It was the 27th leading Major League in this season that a double play won
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth Inning, wall created an RBI double against the closure of Tigers Bruce Rondon and reached the position of 5-4.
The right-hand side, however, stood Sano at three points for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from the role played by an unmovable Phil Hughes.
The tigers achieved three runs in the first two innings against the right-hand veteran who had been beaten before the game from the injury list after he had been missing for more than a month because of a relapse.
"It's obviously not the beginning I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt better when I went out and wondered that I would make some pretty good tips there in the third inning."
After they first got the leadoff battery, Hushes gave up a single on Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, which created a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the score position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right side, creating another race, but Victor Martinez was shot out of the game when he tried to get to third, which ended the threat.
The tigers placed on the second floor, achieved a One-Out Double by Catcher James McCann and a Two-Out Single by Center Field Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins Manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he discovered the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch-count, he didn't reach any points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Reliever Lawyer A.J. later.
There were three runs at Hughes at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTE: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was shot because of an injury to the gunman.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shield of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid August on the list of damages due to damages, should be activated for the launch on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris will be deleted from the list of losses to start against Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30th.
He's been missing since August 20th because of a scratch in the right arm.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will be played against Minnesotas RHP Ervin Santana (5-4.473)
Hundreds of refugees are expected to meet in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The most common people in this area should then be transferred to Notunterquund in Wiesbaden, as the City of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday.
She counted with 450 to 750 refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital were prepared in the past days for this case.
Up to 1000 refugees can be accommodated there temporarily.
They should then be distributed to other municipalities.
Only during the past ten days had 7,500 people arrived in Hessen after the government Bureau responsible for the arrest.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also arranged for large numbers of refugees to stay in sports halls.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The leader of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, holds military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity.
"I believe that certain thoughts about military action options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He proposed "collective ways" to the European states.
Four years ago it was a pleasure to see the neck of a military involvement in Germany.
"Now the conflict is getting worse in front of our door," he said in Germany.
The former German messenger in Washington also called for a massive rise in international aid for refugees.
Austria controls the southern and eastern borders
According to Germany, Austria has also re-checked its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner stated that no one will be sent back to Hungary on Tuesday in the Austrian television station ORF.
Germany has also not sent refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's so agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement which, after Germany, could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Michael-Leitner said that there had already been discussions on this matter between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
It did not mention specific numbers and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In the past days tens of thousands of refugees had arrived on the so-called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria.
Your goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, requested a special summit next week.
Germany had begun border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have not yet been able to adapt to a common approach in the crisis.
EU Interior Ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of more than 120,000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday (22 September).
In view of the strong flow of refugees in Germany, the Federation wants to strengthen its support for the adoption and distribution of people.
The Bund will manage this together with the countries, announced Merkel on the afternoon after almost four hours of consultation with the Prime Minister in Canzleramt, Berlin.
Markers are under stress, those people who need protection, too.
However, those who do not have a living perspective cannot remain in Germany.
This view has been expressly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a "resistance of force."
Thousands of twice as many refugees are trapped between the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its long border to Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced the withdrawal of Romania's border with a tsunami.
This neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent skirmishers from searching for foreign routes across Romania, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said to the planned new border zone.
The Romanian Government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
In Turkey, therefore, thousands of other migrants followed the Greek border.
Space Sonde "Cassini" finds Oceania on Saturnmond Encelladus
Under the Spanish of Saturnmond Encelladus, a global ocean is changing.
The final researcher from the observation of the "Cassini" area.
This is why the moon is light on its path around the ring planets.
This wave movement is only small, but still too large for a passing fixed heavenly body, it is in a speech from the Cornell University in Ithaca (US-state New York) on Tuesday.
The researchers suggest their analysis in the "Icarus" section.
It has been known for a long time that it must be supplied under the ice cover of Encelladus.
"Cassini" has already discovered Eisvulcane on the south Pole of Saturnmond, spreading the water vapour and esparticles and thus feeding the so-called E-Ring of the Saturn.
At least there must be a subterranean sea in the south, the astronomers shut down at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 München has to stay for about a month on the Offensivator Valdet Rama.
An investigation has resulted in an adjuctor damage at the age of 27, shared by the association.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Münchner Löwen, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks of forced rest".
"That's hard for us. Rama is a great loss."
"Of course we need to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "Image" show with a view to the possible commitment of an uncompromising professional.
However, as a training guest, the six-ziggers introduced a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was also under contract at VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian now has "the opportunity to demonstrate its potential".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to the training of men after his brain protection next week.
Already on Thursday, the Austrian national players are going to start training.
Okotia had been injured in the party at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent clash on the head.
In contrast to the first fears, however, he remained without a heavy blow.
No diet - Mangos contain many sugars
Mangos are exotic and delicious.
But whoever wants to watch his evil line, he will be more often rejected by them.
Because Mangos contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: they contain vitamins B and vitamins E and C. In particular, Mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its beta-carotine.
Therefore, those who are the fruits support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, Mangos should not be too soft or firm and taste pleasant.
The shell color alone doesn't tell us how rich the fruit is - so green mangos can taste very much.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then they taste, of course, pure or sweet food.
However, a mango also has a special note from the Court of Auditors.
It softens the light bitter taste of some leaves such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, birds, lamb and wild.
The US package service UPS reimburses up to 95000 allowances for Christmas business in the United States.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, sharing UPS on Tuesday.
In particular, drivers are sought.
In the past year, UPS had already recorded its presence for the holiday season around 95,000 allowances.
In view of the growing online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making preparations since last year to be armed for the Christmas business.
Late delivery in 2013 has brought the package services into sharp criticism.
First spring, then marked Kaltfront
The next night, he starts in the tent of the Alpennord page of the village, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
In the middle of the week and in the night on Thursday, the fawns partially glow with storm strength through the fountals.
After arriving on Thursday morning, we are surrounded by a marked cold front, which brings heavy rains, windmills and a temperature decline.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently located on the front of a vast area of deep pressure across the British islands in a strong south-west stream.
On the Alpennord side, at night, the moon begins at the middle of the valley.
As a result, the faeces will shine until Thursday morning in the foentals with flowers from 60 to 100 km/h and in particular in the Urnerland with over 100 km/h.
The flock can move up to the bordering Mediterranean, and even on the mountains there are Orcanbobes of over 120 km/h possible.
While in the north on the midweek symmetrical fawn for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, moisture begins to stand on the alpensüdhang.
Set here the rain that lasts until Thursday night.
In sum, the Alps must be calculated in the south in the next 48 hours, partly over 100 litres per square metre, which has already fallen large amounts of rain in the last days.
On Thursday morning, the Föhn air goes out, resulting in a cold front with a strong, partly violent flow from the west to the east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind cools up until it is strong, and the temperatures are clearly going back.
The following days will be presented in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, but in the south it will be more sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees on the weekend.
Rome now has a Martin Luther square
Almost 500 years after the reform, there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome.
In the presence of President Ignazio Marino, an unnamed place in the park was baptized in the name of the German Reformer.
At the Piazza Martin Luther, he is now regarded as "German Theology of Reform".
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Colosseum.
The designation was applied by the working community of the evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, priest of the Evangelical Lutheran community in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the Popes were often able to live as a minority only in the hidden faith.
The place will be symbolicly visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was born as a young Augustine monk about the 1510/11 season in Rome.
He then received the city as a coming Sinbabel.
His negative impressions should have strengthened him from the perspective of historians in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther had then introduced the column of the evening church with his thesis against abortion.
Hammer Artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) dorn crown is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
Was it the word at first?
No, not with the Otmar Alt Bible, which has now appeared with great pictures.
At first the image was for Otmar Alt, who formulated his entire personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colors and fantastic shapes has been received by the 75-year-old - but no way is equally significant with "fustive" images.
On the contrary: Adjusting the respective topics can affect it directly.
For about three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from many areas of the "Books of All Books".
Events are cycles that cover subjects such as crossroads, beaches, offers or vaterons.
In this way, he has fascinated several partners: this applies to Luther's work with his theological orientation as well as to the Kettler's work with his focus on art books.
And there is, above all, the author Klaus Altepost, who distinguished himself on the basis of the painting with the respective Bible texts.
He interpreted the Bible sites selected by Otmar Alt and thus today, in current context "replaced".
These texts are like verbal reflections of Alts painting.
They are prayers between Martin Luther’s original Biblical site and each of them is a set of the artist’s own thoughts, which form his own personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewellery band has gold letters.
So the 75-year-old lets a deep look into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
At last, emotions were a major factor in the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Vernigerede in 1940 and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant orders.
"The training has already happened with the Rohrstock," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to work it out so that I may be able to re-contract with the Lord Father."
His second assignment is to help art in a fast-lived time to be more valuable: "The perception of image worlds is now dominated by advertising, and it is heard.
The symbol will be crushed.
Artists have another pleasure and honor to show things.
Images have always something secret and are not decorative.
"In this respect I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall" into the pictures, let them act on them, discover and smell what force they have: "The image is looking for its opposite".
Klaus Altepost was presenting the Otmar Alt Bible on Tuesday in the Otmar Alt Foundation, "I've always" being a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Not only did old people understand the Bible completely but they also chose topics that were important, confidential.
"It wasn't cooperation at all," says Altepost, "it's about the images that appear only in the text." There was an image Bible.
For Hans Möhler from the Luther team, this work is an invitation to "increase his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alts pictures speak both the language of love (Bible) and the responsibility.
A part of the original - paper and leather walls - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November at the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Start build for BMX path
Plans were made, space was found, company was commissioned, soil was modelled for a round course: one year later, almost everything was finished - yet before the official opening of the BMX train was already closed.
Disagreements in politics and administration were due to fear, especially in the people who did not want to wait on the road.
So take off the hill, look for a new place - now with formal planning and application for building approval.
The approval will be granted in October, the first Community member of Sabine Mosbach-Bock could now communicate to the Committee on Children and Youth.
"I hope this year is still visible," she said.
It should then be started without "more memory" with work at the former hall.
DFB intensified commitment for refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 and the Bundesliga sets out a significant sign on the weekend.
The football responds to the growing situation in Germany and the policy ensures its help in addressing the problems that arise.
"I believe this to be the greatest challenge of our country since the reunification."
"No one can say that in principle, it doesn't matter to me, I have nothing to do with it."
"It must be of interest to each individual to get this subject into the grip," said DFB Chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At its annual meeting with the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany.
"I'm next Wednesday at the Chancellor's office and meet the State Minister of State Mrs Özojöz and the Chancellor."
"That will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football can and will help.
But the crucial weaknesses must be put in place.
The German football team has therefore extended its flight initiative "1:0 for a welcome" for four years.
"We have made sure that this programme will continue until 2019," Niersbach said at the end of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some German lists also support this program.
Already this week, the 36 prosthetics set a clear sign when they are on the left triangle instead of the other common sponsorologist (hermes) the phrase "We help - #refugeeeswelcome".
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help, where and how only they can," said Leverkuss's sports director Rudi Völler of the "Image" series (days) and described the project as "self-evident".
"The refugee drama is about everyone, no one should go away."
"We can be football bandlists, no, we need to use our radiation power, our influence and our opportunities to help many refugees who have already been so unbelievable," said Hertha manager Michael Preez.
Hopeneheim's business director Peter Rectig spoke of a "prominent sign of the League".
For the EM Qualifications Game against Hungary this Friday, the National Mission of Women is inviting 100 refugees to Hall/Sale.
Niersbach referred to the support of refugees as "a great Community work of German football".
The fact that all 36 license companies had started their own projects in their places is great.
It is so great that smaller and smaller units are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have delivered, will survive in the football.
"That's of enormous importance," he said.
In this year and next year, the association with the DFB election and the federal government is available at EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The companies have already opened all the sums for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: The Head of SAP lost an eye when an accident occurred
The head of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, has lost the left eye since a storm began in July.
In the case of an accident on the stairs at his brother's house in the United States, after midnight he fell onto a glass of water that he carried in his left hand, reports the "economic week" on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeding, was powerless, then he jumped out on the street - that's what he told us last week," quoted the "WeWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could follow his work.
"In early October we will meet before the Walldorf Supervisory Council," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was "full-time".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutschen newspaper" (Donnesday issue) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software companies.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course I was in regular contact with the Board of Supervisors and its President Hasso Plattner," said McDermett of "SZ".
McDermott usually spread between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he has not been in the German SAP centre in Walldorf.
It was important for him to go to the public with such personal history, the manager of the "SZ" said, "Everyone can go through something like this."
"It's important to get up again when you fall."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen outside weight ...
Magnussen tweeted an appropriate photo and explained that he had suffered the damage when he was driven by the wheel.
He therefore comes to Singapore on the weekend as low as a spare driver for the two national pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as one week later at the great price of Japan.
Football: BVB without Russ against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in Tor
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus have been finalized in the first group game of the European League.
The national player will also miss the board leader of the football Bundesliga in duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 am/Sky).
"We can't get back on him anymore," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
If Reus will be back on Sunday at the Bundesliga Summit against Livercus, the BVB coach opened: "We count him back in training on Friday".
In view of the high burden of his profession, Tuchel will not only change his stems at the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the throat position.
For this reason, Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of the tribekeeper Roman Burki.
"It trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world teacher.
However, if weinfellers will be used in all European league games in the future, Tuchel will be open.
With high probability he will also compete with the second party.
The research by Player Reus that the final input for the BVB in the European League must be the target, middle-field player Julian Weigl says that it is not so wrong: "This is why Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robotics: Government wants pre-emptor role for Germany
Germany is to be a technological forwarder in the change of the car, according to the will of the Federal Government.
The Bundeskabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Dobindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the end of the IAA Automesis of a "new mobility age".
Automated and networked vehicles will increase traffic safety and provide less noise," said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with representatives of the industry on the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport stresses, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband outbuilding and a slow transition to digital hearing.
In order to test new technology, a test line is currently on the 9th highway in Bayern.
In order for the driver to "no additional liability risks" the Federal Government will "check the legal framework conditions and, where necessary, adapt to new developments".
Germany therefore wants to use some international to increase the permissible maximum speed for self-propelled cars from 10 to 130 hours.
In addition, the Federal Government intends to apply itself to an amendment of the Vienna Convention, which provides for only human beings as drivers.
In the case of automated driving, the car will increasingly take over the driving, the driver will become more and more passengers.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds.
After a study by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, high-automatic vehicles will be technically possible by 2020.
Despite the fact that unmanned vehicles are on public roads "expected for the first time after 2020".
The creation of value in the field of motor assistance systems and high-automatic driving functions in Germany is estimated by the authors of the study for 2025 at around €8.4 billion.
"The digital network of the Pkws can lead to more security and efficiency in road transport," said Søren Bartol, a SPD transport policy.
The issue of liability for accidents and the safety of the driver's personal data must be clarified, however.
However, the German cars themselves are still skeptical - much more than French or American.
A survey by the Forsa Institute in the order of the organization of the Dekra survey reveals that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will be implemented in the next ten years, 32 percent will only be counted in 20 years, and 31 percent will not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 per cent of the respondents up to 2025 are automotive cars, in the United States 33 per cent.
However, the car drivers in Germany are not ready to leave completely on a self-propelled vehicle.
After a collection of the Bitkom digital band, only seven per cent would agree to issue controls throughout the entire journey on all roads.
On the road, there could be 15 percent of the traffic on the highway, 45 percent at the station.
Well, every quarter would leave the car control under no circumstances.
Boll says team and double start at table tennis-EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to strike in a single position on 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision shall expire at the latest on 22 September.
"That's a loss of rice for our team."
"The boys have experienced it in the morning."
"But we are strong enough, even without Timo to get the title," said German coach Jörg Roßkopf during the EM education course in Düsseldorf.
Boll is currently on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsor term in China.
The 34-year-old German Master will be back on Friday.
"Without Timo it's the bottom, we're no longer such a clear favorite," said single European Prime Minister Dimitrij Ovcharov.
The Hamelner, who takes the list of seats in Jekaterinburg, also recalled the 2013 EM in Schwechat.
"At the same time, Timo also missed, and we became European masters."
"We should focus on this," said the World Ranking List Five.
The English football national player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has attracted serious damage to the right leg.
At the Champions League game at the PSV Endhoven, the defender was hit by a tankling by Hector Moreno and exchanged after longer treatment.
The first diagnosis showed that at the age of 20, former players from Bastian Sweeinsteiger were exposed to radiation.
Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture from a very large fashion view and a grown-of-fixed barbecue cabinet: designer Jean Paul Gautier (63) presented a exhibition on his work on the Wednesday in Munich.
The heights: Eyebrows, thanks to video projections, look amazingly human.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of fashion - and so that he joined men in their ranks.
"I can't say today that I am the terrible child of the skin culture because I have a white hair."
"In the past it was left, in the middle it's real," said Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the city stage to the race stage), which will be seen from 18 September at the art hall of the Hypo-Cultural Foundation, it is a joy that the fashion maker has changed his initial attitude towards his person.
In fact, he was against it because he said, "It sounds a little after death to me."
If you die, you'll come to the Museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station.
"It's so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Dieteren.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the almost over-visual work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed a training.
Chronologically, the view is not built, but it is a great choreographed overall work for which many additions were used: To refresh the pipes, for example, a stylist was engaged.
14 tons of material the makers have painted according to the data of the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the October party, there was another special Schmankerl: a leatherhosen outfit with corset.
Heidi's daughter Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are closer than men") and for people who are a little different, says Gaultier.
Gaultier's old Teddy is also seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the first, acquired fashion attempts of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and he was not a bad footballer), he was attracted to his Teddy BHs and clothes, says Gaultier.
To play with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
The design of fashion later he himself contributed.
He stole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers, as Gautier told in Munich.
I bought it later, but of course.
He could not pay the models for his first fashion show.
They didn't get anything, but they had to keep the clamotes.
Beautiful instead of Gardene - Plainer Spice as fashion-Nice
Earlier it went to the long stick machines and to make sails to make meters.
The covered substances and tips were created in large quantities for customers, such as coverings and gardens.
This alone doesn't work today anymore, explains Andreas Reinhardt, director of fashion species lungs.
Instead, the mode is again important.
In the early days of the Plainer Spice, fashion played a larger role, then was forced by the domestic textile industry - and now it is recovered as nothing.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: Spices in beauty, accessoryes such as bags and regional trades.
Above all, the so-called Vintage mode, which is based on past stylespokes, is an increasing potential for order.
Those who do not serve Nischen in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
For us, they already make up half of all the orders.
Modespitze Plauen is a member of the Plouener Group with nine other companies.
Only they can wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have been broken down.
Private business and wholesale trade are almost out of reach.
Our products reach the customers this way almost yet.
Today the massware will be produced much cheaper in the Asian area and almost exclusively sold over chains.
In addition, exports are declining, currently in Russia and in the United States.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The sectoral link also tries to point out environmental awareness, as Cordula Farmer of the stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have led a quality cycle that shows that we produce ecologically and socially contractually."
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used".
Diploma Designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger outpost of the West Saxony University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and specializes in scissors and tops.
To combat competition from the Asian area, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension field between the latest ideas of the designer and the companies that need to think in particular economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design will often only be easily varied to keep a customer status.
Some years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter lived the historical snowball spots.
This includes the machine in some places small angles.
The Plainer Goldsmith Master Bianca Hallebach-Cruße was inspired by this: "I couldn't start anything with traditional Plainer Spices".
Now she's using the snowball tip for her beauty.
In an ongoing process, it presents the pattern in Silver.
"Many people in the region are identifying themselves with the theme of Playener Spitze - young and old," says Reuters.
It also delivers to the United States, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose processes have lived in and around the world and who want a piece of memory.
So I see my beauty as a modern messenger of the Plainer Spice.
Disney plant new "Mary Poppins" film
You're not supposed to be lying, but Disney is waiting for a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, according to "Attainment Weekly" it is not about a new film, but about a kind of continuation that plays with the magical girl 20 years after the first film.
It's about the experience of Nanny with the Banks family during the world economic crisis in England.
Who plays Poppins over 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already standing: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi insists on opening up the economy wider for the world
The economy needs to be expanded beyond the external borders to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on the Tuesday of a group commissioned to link the reform.
"China should use it to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business-based strategies," he said in an interview at the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
To promote and promote reforms will create new momentum and vitality and offer a new place for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market access regulations, the relaxation of border control policies, the promotion of state enterprises (SOE), private capital, and the overhaul of the resident communications system.
According to the State, a negative list will be created identifying sectors and companies that are not involved in investment.
The system will be tested and tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, provides a legal area of business and makes the market more open, the State said.
The government will also shut down controls on the powers transferred to companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The State also said that China will be allowed to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
Under a offer to open state-controlled sectors, further areas are open for private investment.
"The Government will not change its policy against foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the State.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee their activities and to use professional judges and state lawyers was also discussed at a meeting.
At the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders, such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, also participated, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double the maximum value of mercury in raw fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large raw materials and to encourage consumers to significantly increase the dose of renal fat.
The Foodwatch Consumer Organisation, which has a corresponding EU paper, criticised the plans, "The risks and effects of advanced industrial and environmental policies will continue to be fully addressed to pregnant and young people," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foofwatch.
Volfschmidt should therefore increase the limit values for large fish stocks at the end of the food chain such as sharks or swordfish from "economic policy reasons" from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large raw fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury that about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold on the basis of the existing limit values.
After doubleing the limit values, only 14.5 per cent would not be sold.
In contrast to this lockdown, the EU considers feedwatch to increase the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
But Foodwatch called it "trick," because smaller Pacific fish, such as some karpfs, are so low that they already contain the planned maximum values today.
The decline in small fish is therefore "a perfect manoeuvre which helps the economy alone", said Wolfschmidt.
Quecksilber is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is very high above the food chain, especially in reef fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "very few amounts can be caused, especially in cases of unborn damage to the nervous system".
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment states on its homepage that the current highest levels are not expected to be a "health risk for the general population".
Quecksilber is mainly achieved by carbon combustion in the environment.
The German coal power plants were released in writing by the Federal Ministry of the Environment to the Greens-Bunde-Tags-Bourbock, Annalena Baerbock, more than six tonnes of mercury per year, two thirds of the total quantities issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish is about Elbe, Rhein and Donau were "continuous and superficial", the "spegel" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, European-wide warnings against mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
