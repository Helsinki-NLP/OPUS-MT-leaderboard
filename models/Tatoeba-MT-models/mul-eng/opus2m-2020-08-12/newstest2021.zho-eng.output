Newwara's review: The return of the best agricultural workers to the village's Revitalization Army - Newwara Network
The village is alive. It's the key.
Where's the guy?
The best return of agricultural groups is the essential biofuels.
The New York Times, Business, Work.
The New York Society became an electric power on July 26, entitled: The return of best agricultural workers to the village's life force.
This year, 34-year-old blacksmiths left his job in the village of Kisang-juang-jung-jung-kun, where he retired from his job in Beijing in 2010.
After a few years of shutting down, the income of his Portuguese farm year, which he now operates, now exceeds the millions of dollars, has become a small- named leader and has been elected to the two "Committee" branches in the village.
In recent years, a series of agricultural policies, such as rural revitalization, have been encouraged by a growing number of well-being farmers who have chosen to return to their businesses, such as wheat and wheat.
The Ministry of the West Bank of the People ' s Republic of Our Republic, the Ministry of Labour, the Province of the Great Lakes, led by the initiative of the "Witnessed Farmers Returning Engineering" project, only in 2019, recorded over 8,000 of the Ministry of Rural Parties' offices from the cited Best Farmers, the training reserve capacity of the village, and the rest of the 2 million members of the Development Party, providing strong assurances for the fight against poverty and the implementation of the rural revitalization strategy.
It's not small. It's key to the old man.
Since the opening of the reform, a large number of young people in our rural communities have been able to work outside the labour force, some of which have created their own businesses by cutting down.
However, objectively also resulted in a different degree of "vacuumization" in rural areas, particularly rural grass-roots organizations, the registration of the Ministry of the Republic of the Parties and the presence of all party members of the Ministry of the Interior, namely old ageing, academic decline, the lack of strength of the community's leadership, and the lack of response to the problem of hunger.
If the elements such as rurals have always moved to the city, the village has long been in the state of "lost" "blood" and is alive as an empty word.
To attract those who are able, consciously and willing to be drawn back by farmers who are willing to work for domestic services, lead them to become leaders of the mining business, from the point of view of building a party, the Ministry of Rural Affairs, and to fill the base-level forces, which is a solution to the abuse of rural party staff and the grassroots organizations.
Good farmers are coming back and they're gonna have to stay and do it.
In recent years, the Quartet has been building on the basis of strict selection standards of farmers, establishing best agricultural work in terms of reference, service assurance, training capacity, selection of system mechanisms such as capacity-building, employment security, life-threatening skills, and the success of official entrepreneurship.
This year is the year of the determination of the hard-to-response harvesters to break away from poverty, which is a key factor in building a strong bond with rural life.
The Government of each Party would like to place great importance on this group of farmers who, through integrated measures, have made them able to make a living, fight, carry out unhindered task forces, live forces, provide strong organizational safeguards and support for rural poor health and development.
As a result of the epidemic, this year's university graduates are a special event, and on the night of July 11, the billibilising day's graduation song will be played directly on a special line for graduates, the old man, the flowers, the flowers, the flowers, and the music are not easy to wait for for for the finals to sing and bless.
The famous Superintendent SealWu also brought up a "garden", which was a very welcome song of his creation based on the same famous collection of novels.
Because of their relationship with the vaccines, a number of graduates were unable to meet the location and gave the school evidence, they transferred it online.
Data show that over 2.5 hours of singing is now more than 35 million.
" Follow your own heart, take the opportunity, no matter what consequences, and sometimes there will be unexpected receipts. "
Although it's a graduation song, many songs don't have to be performed.
"Everyone's youth is so full of beauty and regret, but it's worth the effort to walk away."
Beijing's natural environment continues to thrive, attracting more than 500 other wildlife cities in the new network.
2020-07-26 05:03:17 Source: Beijing Young People's Journal Authors: The King's Office
The capital's natural environment continues to thrive.
Beijing animals have reached over 500 species.
The report (The Kingdom of Beijing) has been informed by the City Forestry Agency that in recent years the species and number of wild animals have continued to increase as they continue to improve the natural environment in the capital.
At present, more than 500 species of farmed game animals in Beijing have been found to be protected at national level, including dogs, black and white, as well as at national level.
Whether it is one of the two types of urban forests, or the small dome between buildings, it is not only natural for the people of the capital but also appealing to wild animals to " settle in the city " .
During the summer season, a group of plants were found in the natural protection areas of the mountain country in the mountains of the northwestern part of the region.
There's a dog playing in the mountains, and two dogs are playing together.
Back in the first place, a wild bull's "snake" is not living on its own. The head of the Natural Protection Area Management Department at the national level of the mountains was introduced by the end of 2019 in a total of over 6200 square kilometres of blue Seas, where 178 wild animals are protected at the national level and 2nd country level, including wild animals, and nearly one third of all species of wild animals can be detected here.
"In the mountains, wild animals are the real 'owner', and our staff fill it with only 'protection' of people. "
In order to understand the situation of wildlife plants in the protected area, there are more than 30 professional patrols every day, followed by a thorough investigation of the protection line along Article 16 and a "circuit circle" per month, with almost one whole day running throughout the protection area.
" In the course of the inspection, it is not necessary to check the biodiversity of the species and also to check the installation of human embryos, the rescue of injured wild animals, and the installation of outer outer space cameras, etc. "
The natural protection area at the national level of the Sunshine country has now installed more than 200 outer cameras to record the living conditions of wild animals in the wilderness.
As biodiversity in the area of protection has grown in recent years, more and more wild animals have emerged from their heads, and cats, bears, and cats have become "permanent" as they have been "permanently resident" in the country's second-level animal protection rate.
The Director-General for Forestry and Forestry Protection of the Beijing Forestry Department announced that there had been an increase of over 500 species since 1994 and that there had been an ongoing increase in the number of wild species and numbers in Beijing in recent years.
The presence of wild animals in the city has become more and more common and has been closely associated with urban warming in recent years.
In particular, a new round of forest-based greening construction, which began in 2018, has been proposed to re-establish the ecological environment of urban areas, to enhance the ecological function of the forest-based soil, highlighting the concept of "nearly natural".
Planned efforts to achieve interaction with the surrounding landscape and to facilitate "neighbourishing visitors" of wild animals are also a source of sweetness for animals and food plants.
I'm committed to helping computers and our communications around the world.
There are a lot of ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers to talk about what they see and understand.
In view of this situation, a modern computer can tell you, there's a woman, there's a dog.
It can tell you, the woman's smiling.
It can even tell you, this dog is so cute.
I'm dealing with this question, thinking how humans understand and interact with the world.
Those thoughts, memories and stories in such a situation, could draw human attention.
Interlinkages related to the situation.
Perhaps you've seen such a dog before, or you've spent some time running on such sands, and more and more waking up memories and thoughts of the past vacation, when you went to the sea, when you and the other dogs, ran away.
One of my guiding principles is to help the computer understand what it is, what it is, what it is, what we believe and how we feel, so we're able to start developing computer technology, in a complementary way with our experience.
So, deep down this thing, I started working to help computers produce stories like humans, from image sequences.
So one day, when I'm working on the computer, I'm gonna ask her how she feels about Australia.
It looked at the picture. It saw a tree.
It doesn't know what the doll is, but the computer says it thinks it looks like it's an interesting animal.
And then I shared with the computer a series of images about the house's destruction.
The computer looked at a picture, and it said, "This is a wonderful vision!
It's freezing my back.
The computer saw a terrible, life-changing event, and it thought it was positive.
I realize that computer recognizes red and red comparisons, and I think it's something that deserves positive evaluation.
Part of the reason is because most of the computer I'm entering is positive images.
That's because when people talk about their own experiences, they tend to share positive images.
When was the last time you saw yourself at the funeral?
I realize that in the process of improving human intellectuals, it is a mission assignment, data collection, computer understanding, to create huge gaps, gaps and blind spots.
At the same time, I'm going to be coded for different preferences.
Predictions reflect a limited perspective, from a data collection -- from which they reflect the same human beings, such as vision and dot impressions.
I recall the development of that technology, which made me reach my place that day -- the first color picture was a collating on a white woman's skin, which means that color pictures were different to black faces.
And the same difference, that stupid point, continued to bring in the '90s.
Even today, the same blind spot still exists in the Department's identification technology applications, how to identify different people's faces.
In today's study, I think of the most advanced technology that tends to impose our ideas on a data collection and a problem.
And so we're creating more blind points and prejudices, which will be further increased when we use human intelligence.
Then I realized that we had to think, we're creating technology today, how to be seen after five to ten years.
In human interaction with the environment, people use time to solve problems, so progress is slow.
Human wisdom is developing at a speed that is hard to believe.
That means it's really important, and now we need to think about it carefully -- think about our own blindness, and prejudice, and think about how these prejudices affect the technology we're creating now, and discuss today's technology, what it means for the future.
CEO and scientists, they've been able to measure their ideas, about future people's intellectual development.
Stephen Hawkin warned: " Human wisdom will cause human death. "
This is an existing risk, and we as civil society; one of the greatest risks to be faced.
"I don't understand why people don't care more about human intelligence."
But these ideas -- just part of the story.
That math, model, the basic component of these people's intelligence, we can both get and use.
We have an open source code tool for the public to learn computers, and at the same time make our own contribution.
Besides, we can share our experiences.
We can share it in the field of technology and its relationship with us, and how we're doing it.
We can talk about what we love.
We can communicate with the future, which may be more useful in terms of technology, or as time passes, more problems may arise.
If we all focus on opening up discussions about human wisdom, looking forward to the future, it will help create a normal dialogue and awareness about human wisdom, what can it become? And all we need to do is to achieve our best results.
We've seen and understood this in the technology we've been using today.
We're using smart phones, digital assistants and automatic smokers.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they useful?
Yes, they are.
They're not exactly the same.
That's where you've seen the future.
The future will continue from our present creation and creation.
We started the Domingo bone effect, which opened the way for progress in human intelligence.
In our time, we've built human intelligence tomorrow.
Let's get tired of building up real technology to bring the past world back to life.
When people find it difficult to communicate, science helps them share their experiences.
It's based on the technology of online video media, which can be used on the car's automatic driveway.
Science is based on an understanding of images, which can develop to help people see technology and help them better have a vision of the world.
We've also seen science and how it leads to some problems.
We have technology today to analyze the physical characteristics of our birth, such as our skin color, or the appearance of our face, to determine whether we are criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to deal with data, to deal with data on sex or race, to determine whether we can get credit.
All we've seen right now is that it's just a human intelligence process.
Because where we are now, it's a moment of change.
This means that what we do now will affect future developments, and extend to the future world.
If we hope for human wisdom to help us improve the way that humans are made, we need to define strategies and objectives, and quickly open the way.
What I want to see is the development direction that fit human culture and the environment.
Science skills help us deal with psychosomatic diseases or other disabilities, make them like everyone, make life as challenging.
The operation of science doesn't measure your characteristics or skin color.
I'm concerned today about tomorrow and after ten years of science.
Human wisdom can be seen in many different ways.
But in this case, it doesn't have any purpose, no one's driving.
It's a car we can drive together.
We choose when to speed up and when to slow down.
We choose if we need to change.
We choose what kind of people's future will be.
There'll be a wide range of competitions.
It'll turn into a lot of different things.
Now depends on what we need to know in order to ensure that the results of human wisdom are better for all mankind.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Black land "type" from the modernization of agriculture - New York
E-mail 26 July New York Harp. Title: Blackland "type" from "Agricultural modernization
In the summer, two airfields of applied pesticides emerged from the second operating site of the fifth management area of the friendly farm and formed two white lines, with a number of large-scale outdoors of "the first day" in the green field.
The headquarters of this operation insisted that this aircraft could one day carry more than 6,000 landfills of pesticides, which are about 8 times as efficient as no human machinery and hundreds of times as human works.
This farm is located in the heart of my first cousins in Hernong, the province of Paz, where, from the last word of the "Shiji" to the present "Lonondon", the traditional Chinese farm and farm have been transformed into this black soil.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used for modernized agricultural production in friendly farms.
On the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve rationalization, reduce agricultural inputs and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technologies can improve standardized operating levels among agricultural fields.
During this year's water production, the plant has expanded its operating range from 3,000 tons last year to 30,000 tons.
This technology order is more efficient to grow, maximizes the use of sun and soil resources, and can save about 16-dollar labour costs.
The farm tried to inform the production of new technologies, such as intelligence, and formed the largest agricultural machinery group in the country from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, at present, farmers currently have a total holding of 4.9% (per cent), with an integrated mechanization rate of up to 99.8 per cent.
Agricultural operations achieve 100 per cent of GPS satellite navigation, 100 per cent of dry land intensively, and 100 per cent of dry land-based Tamil vehicles.
" Green agriculture, smart agriculture, digital agriculture is a modernized route of exploration. "
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Agricultural modernization is key to scientific progress.
A model of modernized "farm" agriculture, represented in the agricultural sector, has been developed in the recent years, leading to the creation of a system of modern agricultural industry, initially scaled up, standardized production and led by industrialization.
There is an agricultural borough of 350,000 square meters of land in the area of a friend park.
This focused on the introduction of more than 140 agricultural machinery for more than a year.
These tools and farms have witnessed the modernization of our country's agricultural development process.
The small village of Zheu is all for everyone - the Anda-Cao-Tao-Tao-Tao-Tao-Tao-Nuwa
E-mail dated 26 July, New York Society entitled: Small houses for everyone — — Andy-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-

On 25 July, more than 4 p.m., the bride wears a pair of shoes full of shoes, from the front door to the back of the house, and the wife's cousin comes home busy collecting things.
"I've got a call from the Ministry of Rural Affairs to move, and I've been working in the field."
He moved more than 60 yards away from the water, and he looked up and looked at it with a good look, "There was also a drug yesterday, and there was nothing left to clean up."
"No one wants to be buried in the house, but the little house is for everyone. "
In order to cope with the continued high water pressure and the potential drop in the lakes, the joint city of Anguilla was ready to launch a flood of water from the Ouija board of the Ouija board on 26 days.
The bridge is located in the coast of Büssey, near the coastal lake.
Several thousand villagers involved in the complex and three river villages need to be transferred.
As at 1625 hours, our fifth largest freshwater lake water remains at 13.2 m high and over-insuranced by 0.7 m.
The kitchens of the house are clean and are kept on the table with a table of fresh South Korean food, a refrigerator with milk and some food.
"I don't want to move. The water of the river is now looking good."
The weekend says that there's a flat in the house, and some big things don't want to be left out for a while.
"Precisely collect valuable items, such as fridges and televisions can be placed in a temporary location of neighbors or neighbors. "
The lord of the village has been firmly committed to the idea of a treasure.
The Queen is responsible for the transfer of 13 villagers, one by one, and one by one informs them of the establishment programme for each person.
The most recent location of the House of Commons is a two-kilometre skiing school.
In addition to large quantities, there are more than 1,000 food and new items in the home that have been placed on both sides of the coin.
"The food's ready to go to the cousin's house. The house can't move."
The couple had a deal and raised their beds under a new bed about half a mile away.
At 6 p.m., the Queen began to transport three vehicles to her relatives, and on Sunday she continued to collect at home.
At 11:00 a.m., my wife and I looked in front of the house once, and we got an electric car and we were ready to take a seat.
"I hope the water comes back early."
It's beautiful.
On 26 July, at 9:00 a.m., the journalists saw the location of the Ouija board and prepared preparations prior to the eruption.
There's a lot of young people on the New York Internet following the Colin's small team.
On 11 July, the Young People's Movement "a Young People's Game of Hot-blooded Competition " was officially held in the South of the South Sea.
The movement's lead team is in the follow-up section and the support of the Lingala small-scale cross-border branch, while Linden and the gardening points appreciate various features, while the hard core of the "butcher" power-sucking device makes the program "burn" more powerful.
In the first place, 11 sports youth-style sports events, which are a surprise to the public at the same time, are also concerned at "strong conflict" "strongly opposed" "strongly" "strong"" in the competition.
Among them, "Fortified Conflict" comes from the first A-Sporter Jovin, who openly challenged the so-called "Breature Men" in the race before the competition, and the outdoor conditions of the popular should go to the show and even release the phrase "Don't waste your tears."
The young men and movement leaders on the first floor were in a flurry of air.
And "strongly opposed" is more like a fight against the gods who are honored by the same powerful spirit as "the Great King" of the world.
And their identity also began to disappear, and they were healthy and healthy actors, and they were disbanded by the White Army and three military leaders.
At the beginning of the competition, the two young men were trying to get out as fast as they could, and on the long-term resistance to the presence of the public.
In a tense situation, the follow-up section as one of the Young People's Movement Teams is also in a serious battle.
In a brief review, he was also very careful to encourage a young person who lost his game to help each point of error in the recovery process.
And the Young People's Home of the Movement is a formal attack, and she does not hide her appreciation for young people who are at stake.
It is much more satisfying to learn about the daily training of young people who are overloaded by the movement.
The same is true of Linden and Kung Fu, the leader of the campaign team, one of whom is a " anti-Semitarian " and one of them is a " crazy girl with a smile. "
In addition, Gigging and Ginger made a lot of jokes as a sports assistant, as well as youth around the movement.
The Fire of the Church of South France: the volunteers in the area recognize fires, the same time and good words - in the new network
On 26 July, the new Internet e-mail media reported that on 18 July France's religious history building in South France, known as St. Peter and the St. Paul's Church, was severely damaged in a fire accident and that the storm was completely destroyed.
On 26 days, the local prosecutor declared that a district volunteer responsible for protecting work in the church had been charged with the crime as "the destruction of the fire".
He has admitted that he himself has a fire in the church.
It is reported that local prosecutor Senas stated that this 39-year-old volunteer from Rwanda recognized three points of fire in his own church at night.
This man's lawyer said that the fireman had done this a long time ago.
He entered France a few years ago through a way of escape and was detained in the church in this concentration camp.
The Prosecutor noted that he had recently tried to update the visa and was in contact with the Police Department for dialogue on this matter.
However, the church remains unafraid of the fact that it is a very good time to laugh and not talk about it will destroy the church that he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on 18 July, the volunteer had been released from the police investigation because he had been described as a problem of logic and had been questioned by the police.
It is designed to rescue firemen at the scene.
During the 25-night period, the person was again informed because of the new evidence received by the professional engineer of the Paris Central Police lab.
This time, the man recognized his self-defense.
It has been reported that if a crime of deliberate destruction is established, suspects may face 10 years ' imprisonment and a fine of EUR 150,000.
It is reported that this fire caused serious damage to St. Pierre and the Church of Paul, and that the roofs in the church were completely burned and the windows behind it were severely damaged.
France's Chief Building for the Protection of France's History, Brune, believes that it is estimated that the work of the Church of South Africa will be resumed for at least three years.
Comprehensive information: United States unilateralism destroyed relations between two countries.
E-mail New York City 26 July Integrated Newspapers on New York: On 24 July morning, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the United States Embassy of China that China had decided to abolish the establishment and operation of the United States General Council and to request a specific request for the General Council to cease all operations and activities.
It was held that the unilateral measures taken by the United States caused serious disturbance to relations between the two Central States and that China responded to the United States without justification and that countermeasures were necessary.
The head of the China Research Centre of the Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile said that the unilateral measures of the United States destroyed the bridge between the two peoples of Central America and brought about a crisis between two major countries.
China informed the United States that the closure of its headquarters was contrary to United States unilateral measures and was in line with diplomatic practice.
Professor of the University of Argentina, the Director of the Athenian Research Centre, Patrio Josto, considered that the above-mentioned decision was the right and necessary countermeasures for the United States, not for the general population of the United States.
The United States has tried to bring the United States' attention to its failure to cover its new epidemics through pressure from China.
The President of the Innovation Research Centre in Chiquia, Indonesia, said that the United States had taken a challenging diplomatic approach to the two countries of Central America and had faced serious challenges.
China informed the United States that the closure of its headquarters in the United States was normal countermeasures, in accordance with diplomatic practice, which reflected China ' s strong principle of maintaining its own interests and reflected a useful detail of China ' s diplomatic mission.
Frances Semmmundza, co-rapporteur of Tanzania, said that the above-mentioned decision was the right and necessary response to the United States' challenge.
The Central American relationship needs to be restored to normal, and the United States should take the initiative to improve its relations with China and stop interference with China ' s internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve economic and political success with China and how to benefit both peoples and the international community as a whole.
The Executive Director of the Arab-China Association of Friends of China at Headquarters in the Sudan said that the measures imposed by China were justified and necessary to respond to the United States in a fair and necessary manner, in accordance with the basic norms of international law and international relations and in accordance with diplomatic practices.
The former United States has requested the closure of the China General Council in Houston of a serious violation of the basic norms of international law and international relations.
It is hoped that the United States will abolish this earlier decision and create the necessary conditions for the normal restoration of relations between the two countries.
Singapore's " joint early newspaper" has expressed its view that the United States' greater strategic intention is to surround China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
Faced with United States tensions, while China was reluctant to see the continued deterioration of Central America, it had to take countermeasures.

On July 26th, the newsmagazine newspaper of New York City learned from the Broad Sea Police Department that the United States Customs, the public sector, had recently broken down a special group of private-owned oil companies, which initially verified the group's total private- oil consumption of about 120,000 tonnes since 2019, with an estimated 8 billion dollars of money for people and about $240 million for the escape tax.
The East Sea Police and the Customs Private Service have gradually clarified the group ' s staff breakdown and organizational structure.
On 8 July, the sea police, customs, the public security sector carried out a unified network operation, including in the state of the state, in the mountains, as well as in the coastal coastal areas, where there were four suspects of private ships, a total of 4700 tons of oil-consuming and freezing a number of financial accounts, respectively, in the case of ships and oil warehouses.
It was understood that this joint operation had launched eight helicopters, two helicopters, a number of action teams engaged in combating the whole chain of events such as the invasion of the sea, the illegal operation of land, and 35 major suspects were all in the case.
The case is now being further settled.
The relevant authorities of the FARDC indicated that the future would continue to be a high-pressure situation, combating all types of criminal offences committed by the sea and maintaining good maritime order in the area of jurisdiction.
"Hanna" is the state of the United States, or it's a river storm and a new network in the mountains.
On 26 July, an integrated external media report from the Central Internet says that at 25 a.m. on the local level, Hanna's Landing States of Texas will bring heavy rains to the state, floods, and perhaps life-threatening mountains.
The National Wind Centre says that it is expected that the "Hanna" wind will bring floods and floods across the southern and north-eastern regions of the state, floods or floods, as well as the life-threatening volcanic eruptions.
It is reported that the most serious impact of the "Hanna" storm is the southernmost region of Kojoscristi to the edge of the Grand Canal, while the Giant Mountains are likely to explode.
"Any wind is a big challenge."
There are 32 mines in the state because of the storm in the disaster.
This population of over 320,000 cities in Kojoscristi has been closed to libraries and museums and the population is seriously awaiting.
Abbott also said that while the state was experiencing a new epidemic, it could no longer cause more damage to the state.
It is reported that the amount of water falling in the southern part of the state is expected to reach between 6 and 12 pounds during the 26-night period and that there will also be 3-5 pounds of rainfall in the northern part of Texas and in the coastal areas of Louisiana.
Because of the effects of global warming, "Hanna" was formed earlier in the Atlantic Ocean.
In general, the first Atlantic wind cycle usually takes place until mid-August.
Poland will withdraw from Europe a treaty to prevent violence against women
The Ministry of Justice of Poland stated that the next week Poland would take steps to withdraw from Europe a treaty against violence against women.
The Minister of Government of the Right of Poland stated that the Treaty required that schoolchildren be taught the issue of gender issues and exercise their rights to the parents of students.
The Minister of Justice of Poland, Mr. Güblo, would say that his lead Ministry of Justice would present a request to the Ministry of Labour and Family to start withdrawing from the treaty on Monday.
The treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
He said, "The treaty includes some elements that we consider to be harmful psychotropic elements. "
The law of Poland ' s administration has a close relationship with the judiciary and its executive union partners with the Roman Catholic Church to promote a sustained social agenda.
During this month's successful follow-up campaign, the President of Poland, Doda, made the right to hate homosexuality one of the main issues.
On Friday, tens of thousands of Polish people (most of them women) were protesting against the withdrawal of the Convention in Warsaw and some other cities.
In a protest march held in Warsaw, Lempat, one of the protesters, said, "The purpose of the treaty is to legitimize domestic violence".
Some of the protesters stood up and wrote "the law and justice parties are the Hell of Women".
The Law and the Justice Party have long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
The Government of the former Central Bank of Poland ratified the Convention in 2015.
The Law and the Government of the Justice Party stated that the Treaty did not respect religion and demanded that the social policy of free movement be taught in schools.
However, as at present, the party has not decided to withdraw from the Convention.

On 25 July, New York City, Brazil's President Bosonaro, announced on 25 July in his personal social media account that his latest new virus testing was in vain.
In addition to the publication of the latest findings of the investigation, Bosonaro also posted photos on social media of his own possession of the CFC.
Bosonaro has always insisted that such drugs can effectively treat new viral infections and have demonstrated their use through social media on several occasions.
According to the Brazilian media, Bosonaro reported on the day that he announced the results of the virus testing, went to the capital of Brazil, and met with a member of the National Assembly.
In the past, Bosonaro has been away from the office of President.
On 7 June, Bosnia and Herzegovina announced in its joint media show that he had been exposed to the results of his six-day new HIV tests and two tests had been conducted on 14 and 21 days and that he had been exposed to them.
"The Green Way" is the New York Internet.
The Government of the People ' s Republic of Zheu Province of New York on 26 July (Hungary and White) has recently made it clear that the Government of the People ' s Republic of China ' s Army will give priority to individuals or their children who are highlighted in this anti-personnel disaster management mission, in accordance with the conditions and physical inspection, political nuclear-democratic and nuclear-degradable.
" After registering young people, we shall give priority to the military after verification of the youth community, the Ministry of Armed Forces and the search for soldiers in the area of the Sun. "
The Deputy Minister for the Armed Forces of the Nine-Minister for Human Rights of the City of Nicaea said that they had been affected by disasters and that they had been focusing on three days of youth testing.
The nine-major district of the city should be a university graduate at the age of 22 and his mother was a community staff member, the father was a retired army officer from a department of air forces, and the parents who had been competing for ten days had been protecting the value of a flood line.
"These days, in the press, I want to be like them. "
The week's competition said that he had from childhood a dream from the military, and he was more determined on this occasion to join the military.
The nine cities also called for the voluntary participation of young people in patrols, the protection of values, the nature of the local people's troops, and their confidence in the military.
According to the 9th Committee of the Ministry of Armed Forces of the People of the City of Nicaea, it is hoped that, through a priority-setting approach, it would encourage more appropriate youth to participate in the mission glory and the good social environment of military glory.
According to the overcrowded news, Gryvori believes that Viet Nam has made a significant contribution to the development of Astana for 25 years.
Viet Nam is not only an Austrian responsible person but also an Austrian fireman.
In Grivori, the Russian Federation and the Economic Union of Aeronautics believed that Viet Nam had contributed to enhancing its status and to expanding its image abroad.
He stressed that "Asia should therefore be grateful to Viet Nam."
The analysis of the peace initiatives submitted by Viet Nam was indicated in Grievor.
Viet Nam is willing to share experiences with ASEAN countries and to propose constructive peace measures on issues facing the Asia-Pacific region, including the East Sea issue.
With regard to the cooperation between Viet Nam and Russia under the ASEAN framework, Grievor believes that Viet Nam supports Russia ' s cooperation with IAEA and helps Russia to benefit from that cooperation framework.
The AEEC and Viet Nam, including Russia, were able to enter into the US Army market after the signing of a trade agreement.
It recommended that the European Economic Union and the Asian States, as a whole, extend the free trade zone of the European Union and its partner countries to create a platform for economic and security stability.
At the same time, Gryvori believed that Russia, Viet Nam and Astana were moving in the direction and will achieve their objectives.
From now until the end of 2020, the Northern Hemisphere will have the necessary conditions, in particular in infrastructure, human resources and land, in order to promote foreign flows, in particular with value chains and forwarding advanced technologies.
In addition, the Ministry of Northern Hemisphere will arrange for a good transfer to the Prime Minister of the Government ' s decision to issue a statement on investment in infrastructure and operational projects in the Trans-Korean Industrial Area and to ratify the addition of the two industrial and urban-service areas of the Province to the overall plan for the development of the South-South industrial district by 2020.
At the same time, the Northern Province is working to speed up the progress of projects, particularly in the rich and rich states of the United Kingdom, with the establishment of a land fund for competition incentives.
In the year 2020, the North-Westphalia Trade Association was involved in the establishment of industrial areas and industrial group planning projects to integrate provincial planning.
The Northern Province determined that the development of industrial areas should be integrated into national security, protection of the environment and food security, thereby contributing to the balanced development of the industry; that they have comprehensive electricity, water, transport and telecommunications infrastructures and that they are linked to urban construction, trade services, labour housing and health, and other social infrastructures such as education.
In industrial areas, the Ministry of Northern Ireland has been calling for high-tech and clean technology investment projects in the fields of electricity, electronics, telecommunications, sophisticated machinery, industrial support.
In the industrial field, the province called for small-scale investment projects in the field of production and use of land-based labour, in particular agricultural products and food processing.
In the future, the Northern Hemisphere will strive to accelerate its investment in infrastructure for logistics centres in the north-east of the city and develop synergy with industrial garden groups to improve goods, cash flows and help reduce production costs, increase the value of goods, optimise supply chains and develop multimodal communications, thus creating attractiveness for investors to invest in the province.
Update the Russian armed helicopter card-52M for the first time at the end of the year-52M-New York
On 25 July, according to the Russian Ministry of Defence ' s plan, the Russian armed helicopter (hereinafter referred to as " armed forces) upgrade version of Ka-52M will complete the conversion of clothes and plant in the first place in December of this year, which will have greater impact on the detection, communication and arms performance of the aircraft.
According to the Russian News News News Day, military-52M is called "super-level short-pound", and its development contract was signed by the Russian military and military units last April, and the first two upgrades are currently underway in the construction of a "progress" space group's long-standing helicopter plant, which will be replaced by its national test and improvement of recovery by October 2022.
The Russian expert who was aware of the above-mentioned upgrades introduced the "precipitation" of the "super-Special Abdominal Abdominance" — the official list of the VU-52 in November 2011 that revealed some weaknesses in the use of the aircraft, which was then reclassified for "flying board".
It was reported that, compared to KA-52, KA-52M would take part in non- weightless new protective materials, its flight crew would be strengthened and equipped with new equipment to withstand missile attacks, thereby increasing the risk of wartime survival; a higher frequency of launch engines to provide more complex mechanically equipped electronic equipment; an increased electrical system could detect and detect more distant war targets; a new light multi-purpose missiles with major attacks on armoured vehicles and shell-mixed land defence operations, up to 20 km; an increase of about 1 times the same type of missile used directly by the current armed forces; and its weapons and communications equipment would be used to maximize the use of m-28NM armed helicopters with the targets that could be attacked in the air.
In addition, Ka-52M will have advanced electronic control systems, weapons control systems and navigation equipment.
The Russian expert also stated that it was of concern that K-52M would be equipped with communications equipment that would be connected with non-peoples, thus obtaining information about the presence of non-peoples in the atmosphere, such as on the screen of the helicopter.
According to the plan, the C-52M pilots can direct control the unmanned aircraft associated with them and thus increase their ability to control the situation in the war zone and to control remote missiles.
According to the Russian media, the Deputy Minister for Defence of the Russian Federation, Kryvoruchko, said last December that the Ministry of Defence was planning to purchase 110 more direct military cass-52M by 2027.
The new Decree stipulates that the Campania district must be covered from the day-to-day in public places, with a maximum of EUR 1000 fines for the offender.
On 1 June local time, Rome, the capital of Italy, was reopened.
It has been reported that in accordance with the latest preventive legislation issued by the Government of the region, the population of the province of Campania met all public transport tools, as well as access to shops, restaurants, supermarkets and camps, it was necessary to pay for the vaccination requirement.
In violation of that provision, the maximum amount of EUR 1000 fines may be paid.
At the same time, the Act provides that all passengers entering the Campania area must be separated from non-Caingan countries.
The Government of the region will authorize health institutions to coordinate specific hotel arrangements and to separate persons with disabilities.
The Act entered into force on 25 July.
In less than an hour, three clients entering the supermarket were punished.
Since this year, 175 million square meters of water supply has been in the North River.
Newspapers of the New York City Stones learned from the Water Office of the North River Province on 26 July that since this year, the province has been fully utilised in the use of irrigation water and local water reservoirs to continue to flow into the river, the Danube, the river and the Baltic Sea, and has completed a total of 175 million cubic metres of ecological water.
The province of North-Westphalia is busy taking advantage of the time available to increase the flow of water from the South Sea to the Danube River, the Sauna River and the San Juan River.
At the same time, 9 large Mediterranean basins such as East-West Army, and the White Sea to the Sun River, such as the Blue River, were used to implement ecological supplements with a total of more than 90 square miles [90 sq km] of water.
In order to do ecologically complementary work, the Office of the Water Office of the North-Westphalia actively conducts flood management, organizes the strengthening and clean operation of the river, streamlines enforcement measures, and enhances monitoring control.
By conducting inspection and focusing visits, timely solutions to all types of issues ensure that river water supply is orderly.
According to the director-in-Office of the North-Westphalia, a series of implementations of the river basins have effectively restored the ecological environment of the river basin of the North-West River and have contributed to the recovery and conservation of groundwater by coastal waters, and has greatly improved the living environment and the economic development of the coastal population, which is important for the achievement of the river management objectives of "water clear, coastal, riverbed and coastal areas" protection.
You should all know what I'm about to say.
I believe that inequality can lead to social division and corruption before the Great Revolution of France.
The difference is that we can now find evidence that we can understand the effects of inequality by comparison with society and by different levels of society.
I'll show you some data and explain why those data are really connected.
But first, let's see how hard our lives are.
I wanted to start my talk with one.
This picture shows our average life compared to the ratio of total national income -- the latter is the country's average wealth.
You can see those countries on the right, such as Norway and the United States, their wealth is Israel, Greece and Portugal twice those on the left.
But this has not affected the average life of their citizens.
No signs of interconnectedness.
But if we get to know the inside of society, they all have a big difference in health.
This picture shows that it's still alive.
These are the little towns of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
There's a big difference between the poor and the others.
Even those who were just under the roof, their health was worse than those who were on the roof.
So income in our society means a lot, but there's no difference between different societies.
That conflicting explanation is, in our society, we see the relative income or the social status, the identity -- the relationship between us and the small gap between people and people.
When you have that idea, you should immediately think, "What if the space-extreme conference is going to happen? What if it's going to reduce the gap?
That's what I'm gonna tell you right away.
I didn't use any assumptions.
My data from the United Nations — as well as from the World Bank — are the income gap between these rich and developed countries.
The way we use it, it's easy to understand, and you can download it, is 20 per cent of each country's previous income gap and 20% of it.
You can see that both countries on the left are equivalent — Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden — their previous wealth of about 20 per cent is about 3.5 to 4 times as high as theirs.
But on the other side of the inequality -- Britain, Portugal, the United States, Singapore -- income gap is about to double.
In this way, our country's inequality (British) is twice the same success of some other democratic markets.
Then I'll show you what this has to do with our society.
We have collected data on issues arising from internal social disparities, which are more widespread at the social level.
Internationally comparable data include average life expectancy, children ' s mathematical and linguistic achievements, infant mortality rate, suicide rate, prison population percentage, early pregnancy rate, mutual trust rate, pregnancy, mental illness — all of which are consistent with the standard classifications of drugs and alcohol — and social mobility.
We put all of these into one factor.
They're all authorized.
The share of one country is the average of these factors.
You can see that these numbers are relative to the inequality I've just shown, and I'm going to repeat these data.
The more unequal countries appear on various social issues.
The connection is very strong.
But if you look at the same health and social issues compared to the per capita income and total national income, then you'll never find anything, no more relevant.
We have a little concern that people might think that we are choosing a specific issue to join our theory and then we have published a paper on the child welfare index of the United Nations Children's Fund in the British Medical Journal.
It contains 40 different parts, from the others' conclusions.
It includes whether children can communicate with their parents, whether there are books at home, how much immunization rates are available, and whether there are fraud at school.
They're all in.
This is the relationship between the index and the same level of inequality.
In an increasingly unequal society, children's performances are worse.
Relationships with them are clear.
But once again, if you look at the child's well-being and the relationship with the income of the individual, you'll get nothing.
All the data I'm showing you right now is the same thing.
Our society's average benefits are no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They are very important in poorer countries, but not so for rich developed countries.
And the difference between us and our position is now very important.
Next, I'll show you some sections of our index.
It's an indicator of mutual trust.
That means that most people agree on the percentage of people who are trusted.
This is from the World Values Survey.
You can see, on the other hand, about 15 percent of people feel they can trust others.
But in a more equal society, this proportion has increased to 60% or 65%.
There is a very similar relationship between participation in community activities or the assessment of social capital.
I mean, we repeated this job twice.
The first target is those rich developed countries, which we then replaced the test target, which has been repeated by 50 U.S. states -- the same question: are those countries that are increasingly unequal in all these assessments doing worse?
This is the relationship between trust and inequality between the federal government in a general social survey.
A very similar distribution of points at the same level of confidence.
The same thing's going on.
Basically, we have found that almost all the factors related to mutual trust reflected in international investigations are also reflected in 50 states that we have investigated separately.
That's not a coincidence.
This is a mental illness.
The World Health Organization uses the same method of experimentation to collect data that enables us to compare the rate of mental illness of each society.
It's a random proportion of the mental illness population last year.
Its scope is from 8 per cent to 24 per cent -- this indicates that the proportion of other societies suffering from mental illness is 3 times that of other societies.
Similarly, these have a close connection with inequality.
This is a crime rate.
Red point shows the United States, the blue triangle shows the Canadian provinces.
But look at their number difference.
The homicide rate is from 15 million to 150.
This is the rate of prison inmates.
This is a 10-fold gap, and the index function will expand this gap.
But the number of prisoners changed from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main reason for this relationship.
In some places, crime can explain some of the reasons.
But more is a severe trial, or a more urgent trial.
The more society is unequal, the more inclined it is to preserve the death penalty.
This is a high school situation for children.
Similarly, there's a lot of space.
If we discuss social selections, we'll find this gap very serious.
This picture is social mobility.
It's actually based on income.
Basically, it's what it's looking for: is there a rich father with a rich child, a poor father with a poor child, or is there any relationship between these two?
On the other hand, Dad's income is more important — for example, Britain, the United States.
And in North Europe, Dad's income isn't that important.
There's more social movement.
As we used to say -- I know there's a lot of Americans here -- if the Americans want to achieve their "American dream," they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I've already shown it here using the label.
I can show you some other issues.
Those problems are more common at the bottom of the social scale.
But there is a problem of poverty-freeness, which appears to be worse in non-equality countries -- not only a little bad, but almost 2 times 10 times anything.
Think about the cost, the costs of human resources.
I'd like to go back to this picture that I showed you earlier.
First, by means of a duplicate map, we find those worse countries, whatever, seem to be the more unequal countries, but those good ones seem to be North Europe and Japan.
So what we see is the relationship between general social disorder and inequality.
It's not just a matter of two things, it's almost everything.
In this picture, another important point I wanted to point out is, if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they're all very different.
The status of women, as they stand for small families, in two extremes in developed countries.
But another important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
Sweden has a huge difference in income, but it uses tax revenue, national benefits, generous relief, etc. to reduce the gap.
Japan is very different.
First, Japan's pay gap is smaller than before.
It's getting lower.
It's less of a favor.
And in a study of the United States, we found a clear comparison.
Some states are doing well by redistribution, and others are doing well because of the low income gap before tax.
So we're going to conclude how it's not important to achieve greater equality, it's important to achieve this equality.
I'm not talking about full equality, I'm saying that there really is a democracy in rich markets.
With regard to this picture, another interesting thing is that not only the poor are affected by inequality.
John Dorn seems to be a bit reasonable: " No one is an island. "
Through a series of studies, we can compare the behaviour of each social class to that of different countries.
It's just an example.
This is the infant mortality rate.
According to the United Kingdom's general socio-economic classification record, some Swedishs have been classified very compassionately as having many babies died.
It's a class of times that don't fit on the basis of the father's position, so single mothers form a group of data.
But we're looking at what's called "Societal low-level", that's a manual job without technology.
Among other things, technical manual work is needed and higher non-manual work has been advanced to professional work — doctors, lawyers, managers of large companies.
Here we can see Sweden doing better than Britain, doing better at every social level.
The biggest difference is now at the bottom of society.
But even on the edge, living in a more equal society has some advantages.
We showed five different data groups, including the education results of the United States and the international, as well as the health situation.
In general, it seems that more equal society is the most obvious difference in the social dimension, but there are also some advantages at the social level.
I should explain what's going on.
I believe that I have an impact on social psychology by showing and discussing inequality.
More is concern for excellence and self-esteem, being valued and invisible, being respected and humiliated.
Of course, those feelings caused by the competition for identity have contributed to the progress of social consumerism.
But it also led to uncertainty about the status.
We're more concerned about how others judge and look at us, whether we appear attractive, smart, or something like that.
The social value assessment has increased the fear of evaluation of these social values.
Interestingly, similar work in the field of social psychology is being done in the same way: some people have access to 208 different studies; in the study volunteers were invited to a mental testing centre and then tested their pressure hormones and their response when they carry out pressure missions.
In this observation, scientists are interested in what kind of pressure is most likely to increase the inner skin, the most important level of stress hormone.
As a result, those tasks, including threats of social evaluation — which threaten self-esteem and social status — can be evaluated by others.
These pressures have a very special effect on physiology.
We've already accepted criticism.
Of course, some people don't like this, others find this very interesting.
But I should still tell you that when people criticize us for choosing our data, we never did.
We have an unconditional provision that if our data source contains data from the observed countries, we will include it in analysis.
Our data source decided whether the data was valid, not us.
Otherwise, there will be a difference.
What about other countries?
In the periodical review of academics, 200 studies were related to health and income equality.
It's not limited to these countries, hiding a simple proof.
The same country, the same way of measuring inequality, the same question one by one.
Why don't we control other factors?
I've shown everyone the entire national income that didn't have any impact.
Of course, others have used more complex methods in the documentation to exclude poverty, education, etc. in trials.
How's the relationship?
The relevance itself cannot prove the causal link.
We've spent a lot of time.
In fact, people have a good understanding of the causes of our results.
In our understanding of the long-term driving factors of health in developed countries, the greatest change is the long-term pressure from society on immunity and the impact of the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, violence in countries that are less unequal is becoming more and more common because people are very sensitive to themselves.
I mean, in order to solve this problem, we should solve a series of problems after tax and before tax.
We should limit income to the culture of the prize income of the gate.
I think we need to do everything we can to get our leaders to take responsibility for the staff.
I'd like to conclude that we can improve our real quality of life by reducing our income gap.
If that's the case, we'll find out that we've just solved the social and mental health problem of society as a whole, that's really great.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In the past two weeks, Spain's new outbreaks of tuberculosis have increased significantly, and thousands of new cases have occurred in many days.
Between Saturday (25 July), the Government of England decided to temporaryize Spain from 26 o'clock on the local time, remove it from the list of safe travel and leave Spain for 14 days.
The decision to listen to British tourists who are lying in Spain expressed surprise and concern and even anger, as news as soon as it comes to it is not effective.
It has been reported that the British Ministry of Transport (Grant Shapps) is currently on vacation in Spain.
Prior to the publication of segregation measures, Norway has also announced that it will take 10 days for people who return from Spain to live in Norway.
France and Belgium recommended that national residents abandon the plan for the former Barcelona and the surrounding region.
Seafarers in these areas are sick and cannot maintain social distance between people and the police are required to take measures to reduce the number of seafarers.
The tourism industry is an important pillar industry in Spain.
Spain: It's safe here.
With regard to the decision taken by the United Kingdom, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicated that the State ' s illness was controlled.
The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs (Arancha Gonzalez Laya) emphasized to the media: " Spain is safe and not only for Spanish people but also for tourists. "
The Government of Spain will attempt to convince the Government of England to exclude the Balearic Islands from the Canary Islands.
The reason is that these two tourist destinations are far lower than British territory.
In order to prevent the spread of vaccines, the "abstaining order" has also been reopened in the Catalan region of Spain.
The tourism industry is an important pillar industry in Spain, while Spain is one of the most popular holiday resorts in Britain.
This decision of the United Kingdom is expected to have a significant impact on the tourism industry in Spain.

Midsummer: Beijing's temporary high temperature, open rain mode-new
On 26 July, the New York Society was the first day of this year's "Middle" on the news.
The 26-year-old wind blew into the air against the wind and spread into the high cold in Beijing, and a new cycle of rains would continue for several days.
The Beijing Meteorological Station is declared to have a dispersible rainfall (with low-minor power) on 26 November, with a maximum temperature of only 27 °C; a low-to-medium rainfall (with low-minor power), and a minimum temperature of 23 °C during the night.
On the 24 to 25 days preceding, the Beijing City Service was in a high-quality blue warning, with a maximum temperature of about 37°C per day in the major region and a high temperature of over 40°C.
The summer is the hottest day of one year, the hottest day of the year, the hottest day of the year, the hottest day, the hottest day of the year, and the "heat" of the Chinese people.
When they entered, the house was full of holes, and the city had a word of "a two-sided wall."
According to the current forecast, the future three days will be raining in Beijing.
The weather sector suggested that the public should be able to minimize mountain areas and prevent natural disasters.
It is understood that this year's "Middle" has 20 days, from 26 July to 14 August.
When you enter the middle of the room, you'll feel tired and you won't want to eat.
Food can be picked from the menu, with a clean solution, a healthy diet, and a tasteful food, such as pain, which can help to enhance the taste of food and to eliminate it.
The driver may fire the FAA's emergency order to check out the 2000 Poophones-New York network.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) issued an emergency call for an emergency response order on 24 days to carry out an emergency check on approximately 2000 air-conditioning and 737 Classic passenger types registered in the United States, which may result from the failure of the above-mentioned client air-conditioning system to stop in the engine.
According to the Federal Aviation Agency, 4 737 NG and 737 Classic passenger suspension reports were received so far, and an urgent check was requested to continue to suspend 7-day and above and to re-enter the flight to date less than 11 passengers.
The Federal Aviation Agency warned that if all of the two engines were to be turned back to their 5th level, they could die at the start of the operation, resulting in the total loss of power and failure to reboot the engine.
This air traffic controller ordered that the key element should be replaced before the client re-enters.
In response later that day, the pollutant responded to the fact that the new vaccine epidemic caused a decrease in demand and that several clients were stored or used as " more easily as a result of pollution " .
At the same time, Po voice said that it had been recommended that the air operator check-in orders should be provided with assistance in the area of repair and replacement of the doors if problems were identified.
The United States reported that the US major airline operators often flew on flights within one day, but after the outbreak of the new epidemic, large numbers of protesters stopped. As the demand for passengers grew, some of them re-entered.
The Federal Aviation Agency did not issue four details of the air traffic stop report.
One of the events was disclosed 24 days later by the Alaska Air Force.
In his statement, the airline operator said that one of the following customers flew from West Asiato, Washington, D.C., to Ostia, Texas, on July 15 and that a driver was suddenly fired and that the customer was finally hit by an emergency at the Oston airport.
The Alaska Air Force said that it had changed the engine of the client and had checked the engine of six clients according to the Federal Aviation Agency ' s instructions.
The United States Air Force, the Joint Air Force and the South-West Air Force, said on 24 days, that no fire-fighting engine fires had occurred in the rear of the flag.
Four clients will be inspected under the U.S. Air Force flag, and 28 customers under the United States Air Force flag will be subject to inspection.
DAA said that 20 clients would check out the flag but did not indicate whether the engine fires had occurred.
Many media reports that the Federal Aviation Agency's emergency air navigation order is another shock to the voice.
A total of 346 deaths were reported in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, by 737 MAX clients from Indonesia and Ethiopia, respectively.
This series of clients subsequently stopped global flights, owned in January this year and resumed production in May.
In June, Mr. Steve Dixon, Director of the Federal Aviation Agency, acknowledged that according to the 737MAX client, the Federal Aviation Agency "has been wrong about the control of the noise".
"School! Good Teachers" The next week, "School Leader" will launch a new-Water network.
There's a new imaginative line.
The interactive knowledge-sharing program, "Water on the Line! Good Teacher", will be released on July 20th in the South Sea.
It was understood that the programme would create a new full-time youth school, and a number of well-known and talented teachers would stand up to challenge the production of interesting knowledge.
In contrast to the deep impressions in the hearts of the former teacher groups, "The teacher is well-founded" is a group of values and skills.
They're either like young students of the sciences or a bunch of bunches, and they're going to be able to live with all the power of "man."
In the programme, these excellent young people's knowledge as "knowledge-sharing officer" will challenge interesting knowledge courses.
They need to demonstrate through positive knowledge and show the most interesting part of their studies to attract the audience.
In contrast, the "inquiry mission" site, which is composed of all age groups, presents a variety of issues, increases the difficulty of teaching "knowledge-sharing officers" and increases the scope of the program.
It has been revealed that this "knowledge-sharing officer" has a high-level academic teacher at the University of People's People's China for all eternity, who is conducting a study of the names of students and of good young teachers such as the king of history who have had decades of experience, who will display to the public the "hard nuclear" knowledge of various sciences in the present world.
In addition, the program invited Professor of Economics Zhao Zhao as the "Schooler of Knowledge", a joint "Water and Dream", to talk to the audience about youth, and to create a "public school for all young people".
Director of the Hong Kong Government Division: The situation is severe, full of resistance to new networks in Hong Kong.
On 26 July, the Director of the Hong Kong Government Division of the Hong Kong Region said on 26 July that the situation of new lung cancer in Hong Kong continued to be serious, and that, if the vaccine was reversed, the Government would take more stringent control measures to further restrict the business of the farm and reduce the presence of civilians.
However, the Government of the region at this stage does not intend to impose "a residence order" or "a ban" on citizens.
On the day of the construction of the church, a website entitled "The situation is severe and full of resistance" was published.
He said that this epidemic had been the worst for half a year and that it would be very critical for two weeks in the future to work towards preventing the spread of the virus in the community.
Apart from the necessary measures taken by the Government of the Special Territory, self-regulation and co-operation of citizens are also essential.
He called on the civilian population to stay at home as much as possible and to reduce social communication and out-of-court use.
Citizens should take measures to protect themselves and others in line with the mandatory measures taken to cover their mouthpieces, focusing on personal and environmental health and work-related washouts, and should be more likely to stop unnecessary association or association of friends or to reduce to the city.
He expressed his deep concern about the change in vaccines in Hong Kong and the support of the Government of the Special Territory for the prevention of vaccines, and actively responded to the latest requests of the Administrator to assist in increasing the inspection capacity and the transformation of the Asian International Hospital for the like " Side Hospital " .
The build-up report indicates that the Government has conducted a comprehensive inspection of the free virus for specific high-risk groups, such as Anjastos, Disability Hospitals and Rehabilitation Officers, Food Office staff, Train Drivers and Physical Managers, involving over 400,000 people.
He was very concerned about the cases of infection in the Anjat Building, and the Government of the Region had arranged for a specific temporary clinic for friends of Anjat Hall.
He said that the Government of the Special District was building a separate vaccination facility near the Ouija board centre in New Hampshire, which was expected to provide additional 700 separate rooms by the end of September.
The Administrative Officer also announced on 19 days that the Government of the Special District would build several separate rooms between 2000 and that it would fall before the end of this year.

In recent years, the NEPAD has noted that " the history of the Chinese Communist Party, New China, with a view to bringing more than 1 billion people and more than 9,000,000 parties, particularly at all levels, to learn a good lesson in the history of the Chinese Communist Party, the history of China. "
A serious study of the history of the party, a new Chinese history, is an unforgettable experience for the Party's staff, keeping in mind the necessary lessons on mission, taking on rich food and raising the family's emotions and making the long journeys of the new generation.
A history of the New China Party, which records the struggle and the litigation of the Chinese Communist Party since its birth, has demonstrated the belief and loyalty of the Communist Party in the use of life and blood, and has always maintained its original and destination.
History is the best textbook, and for party members, history, new China is the most popular chapter in this textbook.
Every party member's department needs to be constantly strengthened in its historical context, moving to the future history of the past, establishing a new agenda for the new mission, taking the "caught-up" of the era, and taking the long path of moderns.
In his life, in the history of the student party, he maintained his original mission in the new history of China.
The history of the party, the new Chinese history, is filled with the constant initial mission of the Chinese Communist Party and the strong faith of stone. It is evident that the Community party has always had a warm feeling with the people.
Far from knowing the history of the party, the important events of the new Chinese history, the important meeting, the important person, not only the mental stir, the thoughtful prayer, but more than the mind-set of the mind, within the understanding of the original faith, and the sharing of the meaning of life.
With regard to the Department of the Party, the desire to continue to give priority to life, always moving ahead in this colour, will be found in the history of the Party, the origins of which we have been issued in the new Chinese history, the first step towards keeping our senses and firm position, and the strength of the country to be a national hero, and to ensure that the revolution is transferred from the Red Mount of the Red Sea before the blood and life.
In the history of the student party, in the new Chinese history, there is a high spirit of respect.
Since the formation of the Chinese Communist Party, it has developed a series of great spirit, such as the spirit of Red Sea, the spirit of the Mountain, the spirit of glory, the spirit of peace, the spirit of war, the spirit of Singapore, the spirit of "Two-star" and a series of great spirit, such as the spirit of space.
These great, historic spirits have provided strong spirit to our party on its front road to fight all kinds of risk challenges, which are free of fighting, indiscriminately, and inexhaustible, precious spirit.
In the history of the Party, China's history is the process of putting these spirits in a warm and self-sustained state of mind and self-esteem to feel proud of the pre-resurrection spirit, to maintain the community party's spiritual garden, to achieve a solid foundation of dreaming, and to inherit and honor these spirits and produce a new era of light.
Reading the history itself, in the history of the student party, the new Chinese history has been preserved.
With regard to the Department of Party Affairs, there has never been any history, which could bring more serious warnings than the history of the party, and the new Chinese history would show up and take account of it.
In the history of the party, in New China, we can both see the faith of an old revolutionary who is committed to his own faith, not only with a sense of failure to achieve the goals set, but also with some people who are motivated by the idea of faith and go to the deep lessons of the revolution to stand up, and show and warn us never cease to stand firm and eager, never to give up, always having a strong spirit of struggle, and always having a strong spirit of integrity and integrity, and to correct the law.
In order to be truly a strong believer in communism, loyal practitioners need to think about "push," serious "pollution" infection, the history of the party, and the new Chinese history should be self-examined by every party member.
In the history of the student party, the new Chinese history of courage re-enacted.
The A/C.P.A. noted: " Learning Party History, National History, is the maintenance and development of China ' s special socialism and the continued promotion of the necessary lessons for parties and countries to progress. "
Looking back to history, asking for the first time, to continue glory and to go to the future.
Each Party's Department should keep the history of the study party, the new Chinese history as a lifelong pursuit, the continuing direction of life in the study, the courage of history at its various places of work, and the responsibilities and the active activity as an active role.
Consisting that the progress of the former revolutionist is a reference and direction, that the political colors of the Communist Party continue to shine, that the struggle continues only in Korea, that has an objective battle spirit and that is more dangerous than ever before, and that it is written in a series of resurrections of the People of China.

The rich and rich-grandparently rich-grandmothered bluefin tuna has grown up with a "Eco-priority, green development" concept, which now has a "Symphony" that is called "Economic, Green Development", followed by a "Golden Dream".
It's the river's "Silver Dream"
"The Rain River under the sky, the Rain River, is 397 miles [397 km] away from the "Mother River" on one side.
However, as industrialization progresses, urbanization, the development of river lakes in the use and management of imbalances, excessive depletion, floods around the lakes, flooding in the water areas, leading to droughts, floods, floods, environmental disturbances and ecological degradation.
Now, Ninsha is contributing to a variety of ecological reforms and is trying to clean up the rivers of the Red Sea.
The water's coming down from the source.
In the Ninsha Bank, locally through the "promoting + cleaning + strict" approach, the whole area of industrial soil pollution has been concentrated, the urban water treatment plant has achieved the full level of standard A emissions, the urban build-up of black water infrastructures, and the successful declaration of success in the third set of China's black water model cities.
In addition, in 2017, the Ninth-Ninish regime was fully operational and now has reached the fifth-level river basin control system of the district village, which has become the norm.
The 64-year-old samurai lived in a village near the river, where he saw the change in the river: "The former part of the water smells and there is no taste after it was harvested. "
Sociologists say that the ecological environment has improved, and his life is much more comfortable, and now he and his family walk along the river and feel the blue sun.
The "dark land" of the Sasha.
Birds, trees, rivers, rivers... the beauty of the "Sao-Sao-Sao-Sao-Sao-Sao-Sao-Sao-Sao-Sao-Sao-Sao-Sao-Tao" park in the Ninsha Bank.
The rivers flow into the river, along the road form riverbeds, lake basins and many droughts, play an important role in the rational use of water resources and the ecological balance of water resources, while also becoming an international guide for migration of the species of fish.
Since 2009, the Ninsha-related sector has invested around 345 million people in the project's funding for the project for the protection of shelters, currently accounting for $19.9 million, with 78.5 per cent protection rates, natural lakes, 200 national swimming pools, 1 national municipal swimming pool, 6 municipal swimming pools and 8 municipal parks.
The Deputy Director-General of the Banking Protection Centre told reporters that the protection of cattle has increased biodiversity and is particularly evident in the species of birds, "the remains are a dangerous species, with only over 20,000 people in the world, with more than 2,000 fishing areas. "
At the same time, in accordance with the Ninsha Act, the Red Line between 500 metres of the region was established for the protection of the two coastal banks of the Gulf River, providing that no unit and individual must develop and operate within the scope of protection.
The Deputy Director of the Centre for Water Services of the Bank of the City of Banking has been briefed by the fact that, through the management of pollution sources, integrated river ecosystems and the construction of the final dams, as soon as the water content of Article 9 has reached 100 per cent of the standard of category IV, the water has now been cleared and the fish has flowed and the flowers have been grown. "
The "Drink of Water" of the Peanuts.
The city of Ninsha Bank had a name for "Shuang": the only city in the town of Zhaoju is "to keep drinking water."
Since 2010, the city of Banking has faced the issue of a continuing high-speed water shortage, which has been an experience for many high-level residents of the region in recent decades, but in many large water sources it is too limited to be able to cope with the situation in the area of large-scale groundwater overwhelmed areas, and water shortages have become a problem in the banks.
The improvement in the quality of the saltwater supply has been beneficial and has become a good solution to the problems of drinking water for local residents.
The Vice-President of the Banking City Water Agency made it clear that, in order to improve the production of water requirements for the inhabitants of Bangui, Ninsha started a water project on the west bank of the City of Bangui and replaced the original groundwater.
"On 29 December 2019, the Water Agency officially transferred water to the three districts of the city of Bangui, and in 2020, the town of Mining and the inhabitants of the Grand Canal also drank water. "
It is clear that the banking sector will take full account of the changes in the integration of rural drinking water and urban water supply into the region, " next step we will integrate rural water distribution into the West Bank's water supply projects, which are expected to be fundamentally integrated into the banking region at the end of this year " .

The Ministry of Labour reported that, in accordance with legal regulations such as "net security law" "television regulations" and "internet user information protection provisions", a third-party inspection body of the organization conducted a survey of the use of mobile software to ensure that companies with problems are integrated.
This is the issue of the existence of section 58 APP, including the collection of personal information on a private basis, the collection of personal information on a cross-border basis, the frequency of applications, the excessive demand for rights, the loss of account, the private share of third parties, and the lack of access to such rights.

The Louis family: John Lewis is a fighter for "the weakest."
A member of the United States Congress, John Lewis, was remembered as "the weakest fighter" at his follow-up meeting on Saturday (25 July).
The public follow-up meeting of Louis began on Saturday in the state of Alabama.
There were two follow-up meetings on the first day.
At a public meeting at the University of Troy, Alabama, on Saturday, five of Louis' brothers and a cousin spoke of him as a loving, fearless man with a family.
Henry "Grant" Lewis, the youngest brother of Louis, said at the meeting: "He is committed to helping others."
Samuel Lewis says his mother warned John "Don't worry, don't worry."
He added that John had not heard from his mother, saying: "We all know that John will be in trouble, and he'll always be in trouble, but that's because he's stuck in the right thing, that's a good trouble."
The sister of Louis reminded the people at the meeting that John's most famous argument was to create a "good problem" and that it was not to prevent the incident from occurring just for justice.
John had been applied for at Troy University in the city of Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but at the time he refused his entry.
This young man, John Lewis, who preached on his farm with dogs, eventually received religious and philosophical education at Fisk University.
Many years later, the University of Troy granted Dr. Louis honor.
Doug Jones, a member of the National Assembly from Alabama, said that the current protesters "are at peace and non-violent protests", as Louis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: "Even the President of Tranquo has beaten a shipman and made all the protesters violent, but he's wrong.
The protestors are lovers and they hope that the United States will move towards a more equal country."
A series of six-day events to commemorate Louis will be held this week at the funeral in Georgia.
On Saturday, Isis' tree was suspended in public monumental activities at the University of Troy, where respect for this civil rights movement was expressed for the first time.
On Saturday evening, a private ceremony was held in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public commemoration.
The remains of Louis will be passed on to Edmund Pettus Bridge, Selma.
In 1965, he and his group of demonstrators requested black ballots were wounded by the police in the state of Alabama before this bridge, and the police also had to hand over their troops to the demonstrators.
Louis was almost killed at the time.
This day is called the "Saturday of Blood".
The remains of Louis will be transported to the capital of Montgomery, Alabama.
Steven Reed, mayor of the city, encouraged people on the human race and ended this last time with Louis.
At the same time, officials called for public participation in the activities and maintained social distance.
Kay Ivey, Head of State of the state of Alabama, ordered half of the flag to be dropped on Saturday and Sunday.
In the near future of the Memorial, the remains of Louis will be separated from the Assembly Hall of the state of Alabama, in the city of Montgomery, located in the Assembly Hall of the state of Georgia of Atlanta, as well as the United States Congress in Washington, Washington, U.S.A., to commemorate the public.
The President of the United States Parliament, Nancy Pelosi (Nancy Pelosi) and Mitch McConnell (Mitch McConnell), and most of the members of the Senate, declared that they could be honored at the summit this week and Tuesday to the United States.
As a result of the outbreak of anti-emergency vaccines, public activities will be held outside the home.
I'm going to go out and look for an opinion on the New York Network.
On 26 July, the New York Society encouraged residents to do physical inspection and early detection; prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors; establish a network game health review system; use units to have specialized and functional health managers prior to the official publication of "Intra-Economic Health Regulations (Requirement for Comments)" and residents of deep age will have their own "health law".
In order to encourage urbanization to do physical and early detection of problems, the above-mentioned submissions suggest that the health sector should develop a basic health inspection project directory based on factors such as age and career.
Health inspection costs within the basic directory of the health inspection project are paid by the Social Health Insurance Integrated Fund in accordance with each year's standards.
It is clear from the request that the unit should reasonably set human resources, arrange time for staff to work, impose more severe staff burden on mental and physical work, implement a rotational system to avoid excessive damage or physical health damage to the human health of workers, while strictly implementing staff leave.
In addition, staff units are required to have specialized and functional health managers and regularly organize staff health checks.
With regard to the physical health of minors, it is proposed that comments should be made on the prohibition of selling alcoholic beverages to minors, while restrictions on the sale of alcoholic beverages should be made on their places of sale, which would be adjusted by the market surveillance management authority for violations.
In addition to "absorbing" , minors also need to " multiple movements " .
In accordance with the request for an opinion, the school has to schedule more than an hour each day for family sports activities.
For network games, public, cultural telecommunications sports, network control, health management, Internet service health control systems should be improved, network health review systems should be established to promote good communication between young people and cultures in order to promote the development of youth health.
In addition, a request for an opinion was made for the release of patients with infectious diseases into public places and the medical institution had to pay 20,000 dollars for private punishments without the consent of the public.
It is worth noting that, in addition to the physical health of the population, comments should be requested that, prior to the development of urban space planning and construction, industrial garden planning and construction, resource development, use and environmental protection, biomedicine industry development, normative documentation and approval of major construction projects and major public services projects, public policy should be assessed on the impact of public health implementation.
Without an assessment or an assessment, it would have a serious adverse impact on public health or the health of the urban population, and it would not be possible to establish or approve the implementation.

In recent years, the JAPC has highlighted the need to strengthen the leadership of the party, to promote the expansion of the party ' s top level and to provide strong assurances to the governance of the urban community.
Consisting that party-building is guided and that the leadership of the party is implemented in all aspects of the field of grass-roots governance is a critical fundamental requirement for improving the quality of grass-roots governance.
To improve the level of grassroots governance, to strengthen party leadership, through enhanced political orientation, to build battle tanks, to combine red forces, to promote political advantages of parties, to organize advantages and to transform the people's efforts into governance advantages, to transmit Party forces and claims to "the last mile".
Focus on filling in the soul and strengthening the political orientation.
The strengthening of political guidelines for biogeographical governance must be well implemented.
In order to develop a deep understanding of Chinese special socio-socialism as the primary mission of the new generation of China, to build "Immediately, to remember my life" as a party's permanent and final class, to strengthen my ministry, to read the original principles of the original school, to distribute training, to study, to organize large workshops, to continue to promote the innovative and armed spirit of the party, to further strengthen "four awareness", to strengthen "four self-reliance", to make "two" better performances.
By means of a learning process that combines the lines with the lines of learning, the wide range of learning channels leads to the integration of learning into the daily and often to the integration of learning into the field of grassroots organizations and members of the department.
Focusing on practices and focusing on key issues in the decentralization of grassroots governance, focusing attention on the concerns of the public, the concerns of the people, the concerns of good intentions, the politicism and capacity.
Get regular promotions, make fighters.
WFP is both an important component of the GGG system and an important component of its governance capacity.
Promoting the normalization of WFP and the entry into force of the regulations governing the work of the Department of the Party, leading to the weakening and deterioration of the Organization of the Party, through the establishment of the following mobile mechanisms, the establishment of new offices, the establishment of a standardized and weak distribution, the establishment of a sound decision-making mechanism, the establishment of a multi-service mechanism, the establishment of a framework, supplementing tables and promoting development.
In rural areas, strengthening the standardization of rural party organizations, the implementation of the system of standardization of building standards in the Departments of Party Services, the form of normative organization, learning activities, management mechanisms, effective promotion of "third-session curriculum", thematic party activities such as day-to-day activities.
In the city, attention is paid to street communities, explore forms of the establishment of the innovation branch, combine areas of weakness, "pity" "pity", "pity" and "pace", actively build the Union of Urban Parties to achieve effective coverage of the work of the parties.
At the same time, the establishment of a system of sound grass-roots governance mechanisms, a comprehensive system of public affairs, a common practice, a common approach, emergency co-operation, difficult co-operation, a decision-making mechanism led by the Al-Qaida Party Organization, a process of interlinking the public service mechanisms of the Party ' s departments, an increase in public access to the public service, a sense of happiness, dignity, self-esteem, and a more warmer climate of grass-roots governance.
It's an initial role. It's a red force.
The Ministry of District Party personnel is the cornerstone of Al-Qaida governance.
Enhancing the capacity of grassroots governance, focusing on enhancing the governance capacity of the Ministry of the Interior Party staff, and focusing on the role of the model role of "red cells" in grassroots governance and the combination of red forces at the top of the service community.
In order to improve governance capacity as a necessary training for the Ministry of the Interior Party, to further strengthen thinking skills, professional training and practice skills, and to develop a spirit of urgency in the critical task force in this position and to contribute to the modernization of national governance systems and governance capacities.
In order to carry out a wide range of " community breakdown, reporting to" activities, through participation in the activities of thematic party day, linking difficult groups, identifying services projects, recognizing micro-will, making reasonable recommendations, and taking part in community building, management and services, the participation of party members in community governance.
In order to play a full role in rural non-permanent actors, the creation of a team such as the establishment of non-permanent parties and the creation of a team of non-permanent parties will lead to the active participation of large-scale grassroots parties in activities such as poverty eradication, eco-building, confidence-building, tourism and the prevention of smoking, and better integration of red force into civil service.
The ground is solid.
The Al-Qaida party organization is the base of government headquarters.
The only way to build a party's leadership as a key means of promoting innovative development of grass-roots governance is to keep close party relationships closer together, to increase people's well-being, to promote grass-roots governance, to bring it out, to get out, to get up, to get up, to promote grass-roots governance, to be organized, strong and effective.

It's possible to hide the sheep in the repatriation season - New York.
On 25 July, New York City's National Parking Authority (Kinkin), an electric journalist, was informed of the five-way protection stations available from the Cacili Authority of the three-sourced National Parking Authority, which had been monitored for the past time, and showed that sheep hides and skins that had been buried in the coastal areas of the Pacific Ocean had been buried and had begun to return to their original habitat.
The monitoring scene near the five-way protection station shows that on 25 July, about 40 male goats were led by 3 male sheep and 3 female sheep were kept in hiding only 3002 kilometres through the dark road, and the five-wheeled sheep had begun to return.
In recent years, experts have analysed that one quarter to five percent of the total number of flocks of sheep kept in the herd.
The Deputy Research Institute of the North-West Institute of Biobiological Studies in the Western Hemisphere, China, also stated: "In the early stages of the return, sheep are at higher risk of being arrested and therefore the number of young sheep groups will be lower and even less likely to occur without infants. "
According to the statistics of the Corporal Management Office of the Director of the three-sourced National Parking Authority, the total annual increase in the number of flocks has been observed, with only 4860 flocks in 2019 and an increase of 338 over 2018.
In fact, it was said: "It is expected that this year's return will end in early September and that the number of shepherds will continue to increase. "
Protection of animals at the national level.
At the end of May each year, from the three sources of the Blue Sea, the West Bank and the New Alpine Mountains were to travel to the coastal shores of the Pacific Ocean.
Our National Shepherd Protection Expert, a researcher at the Institute for Animal Protection in Susi Province (Northern Institute for Animal Hazardous Studies), said: "The flocks are returned to their home after the end of the breeding season, and the land continues to take young chicks back to their resting place. The number of herds leaving the nesting area is greater than the number of herds, but then the flocks return to their rest by different geographical groups along different routes."
In order to ensure the safe return of the flocks of shepherds, the journalists learned that the Office of the Director of the Field of the Former Three-Source National Park Manager has arranged for staff to continue video monitoring and field patrols in the main areas of return.
If a group of shepherds were found trying to cross the road, the patrols would conduct temporary traffic control at the first time and ensure that they were safe through wild animals through the route and that they would be at the lowest possible human interference on their journey back.
So, how should I end up in everyday life?
The experts suggest that it is best not to walk or work during the winter as far as summer is concerned, since the sun is the strongest and the possibility of drought is high.
If it is necessary to leave at this time, it is necessary to do some protective work, such as sunscreens, sunglasses, sunglasses, and the best sunglasses to prevent injury.
Clothing is the most selectable color, so it's the best, so it's the best, so it's the best, so it's the best, so it's not the best, it's the best, it's the best, it's the best, it's the best, it's the best, it's the least-class, it's the least-class, it's the least-class, it's not the most-fashioned clothes, it's not the best-time, it's not going to be hot when it gets out.
At high temperatures, sufficient water is prepared to be used for drinking and not to wait until it is too late, because once it is felt that the body is running out of water, it is controlled at 150 to 200 millimetres per drink, and it is not to drink cold water.
Based on a low temperature, general staff drink 1.5 to 2 degrees per day, high temperature workers and 3 to 5 degrees per day.
More than once, it is appropriate to supplement a few wells and fill the gaps that have been lost because of them.
In addition, it is easy for summerers to feel tired, and drinking water is a very good drink.
High levels of water in the summer can be used to supplement water; milk products can both supply water and meet the physical needs of the body, such as wheat, barley, sigua and sugar.
In addition, groups working in the high-temperature environment should be adequately supplemented by products containing lead and other elements.
It's a short night of summer, warm weather, human beings' new appearance, and consumption, and it's easy to feel tired.
Enough sleep can give both the brain and the body the rest of the system, benefiting from work and learning, as well as preventive measures.
Experts say that the best time to sleep is from 22 to 23 hours and that the best time to get up is from 5.30 to 6.30 hours.
When sleeping, be careful not to sit under the air and the air to avoid airborne diseases and heat.
Experts suggest that groups of people who are out-of-house activities or perform high-heat operations may be accompanied by 10-inch water, human teeth, hot water or hot air. They may be placed on the site at any time in order to prevent an outbreak.
I hope everyone can take some time to think about a very simple fact that, so far, most of our knowledge of the universe has come from light.
We stand on the earth looking forward to the night sky, and we can see the stars of the sky with our physical eyes.
The sun is so powerful that it's so bright.
We can see the light coming back from the moonball.
From the time we know the universe, through the light we see.
With the help of modern spaceships, we have been able to collect the silent universe images -- this series of images that can be traced to a huge explosion.
But the universe is not a mystery, because the universe is not really silent.
I want to tell everyone that the universe has its own partner, and the universe itself is constantly playing, because space can move as much as it can.
So when something important happens, it can send a series of voices to the universe.
Now, we want to be able to give this amazing visual work on the universe to sound.
Although we've never heard a voice from outer space, we should be able to increase the volume over the next few years, hear what happened there.
With regard to the capture of the voices of the universe, this great goal, we focus our attention on the dark cloud and the future that it shows, because when the clouds can blow up, like a wave of lightning, they send a very special sound, and I am very happy to play some of the sounds that we predict.
One day we may be able to see a shadow, a cloud may remain visible in a very bright background, but it is not yet observed.
Although black holes can't be seen, they can be heard, it's because they're hit by air like a wave.
This idea that the universe can sound the same way from Albert Einstein, is actually from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe was empty, if the universe was empty, it would look like this photo, except those on top of the relief lines.
But if we break free in the universe, even if we don't have these auxiliary lines, we're going to draw these lines because we'll find out we're next to the direct movement, along the straight line that doesn't happen through the universe.
Einstein also realized that this is the most important part of "material" -- if you put energy and matter into the universe, the universe will collapse.
That's what Einstein's vast scope is.
Even the path of light will be broken.
When it gets bigger, it turns around the orbit of the sun's movement, like the earth's orbit around the sun, and the moon's orbit around the earth.
It's the natural line of music in the universe.
But Einstein didn't realize that if you pushed the sun into a six-kilometre-like ball -- that is, if you cut the Earth's equivalent to a million-dollar object into a six-kilometre ball -- you're going to make a hole, and this object's density is so high that if light is too close, it won't be able to escape -- there's a big black hole in the universe,
But Einstein has always considered black holes to be just a mathematical point.
He doesn't believe that there really is a dark hole.
He believed that nature would prevent the formation of black holes to protect us.
People started using the term "black hole" after decades and realized that the black hole was a real existence -- in fact, they were some of the great-quality stars at the end of their lives, which happened after a catastrophic earthquake.
Our sun will not turn into a cloud.
It's not really big enough.
But if we've done some thinking experiments -- Einstein really likes to do this -- we can guess if we're going to force the sun to break within six miles, and then put a small planet around it, for example, on a 30 km distance away from the sun.
The earth sheds its own light, because the sun no longer sees us, we have no other source of light -- so our little planet has its own light.
You'll find out that you can even place the earth on a 30-mile road outside of the cave and let it run smoothly.
This black hole, it's almost as big as Domanhaton.
Before it destroys the Earth, it may be crashing into Hudson Street.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
What we're talking about is one thing that's being pushed down to half of Manhattan.
So we move this planet to a place close to the black hole - 30 kilometers away - we notice it runs along the perfect path of the black hole.
There's some announcements that the Black Cloud will destroy everything in the universe, but actually you have to leave as soon as you get really close.
But it's very impressive that from our point of view, we can always see the Earth.
It can't hide behind a cloud.
Some of the light from the earth fell into the cloud, but some of it was broken into the cloud.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the horrors of space boroughs in Karajaga and you're fighting with the Zionists, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Our sun will not shrink into a cloud; its quality is not large enough, but there are tens of thousands of clouds in our galaxy.
If one of them's in the bank system, it looks like it's gonna be like this.
We'll see a shadow of a dark cloud on the billions of stars in the bank system and on the bright rays of the stars.
If we turn to this dark hole, we'll see the light going around the black hole, and even when we start to enter this shadow, we'll never feel some big changes are going on.
If we try to start the rocket and get out of there, it won't work, because we can't run away, nor can the light run away.
Although the cloud looks black from the outside, it doesn't look like it, because all of the planets' light lines can fall together with us.
And even so, because of the relatively low time effect, our time seems to have changed compared to the time of the bank system, which seems to be as if the external system is accelerating, before we're destroyed by the black hole ourselves.
It's like a physical experience of death, and you saw the light coming out of the tunnel, but it's a perfect experience of death.
You didn't tell anyone you saw the light on the street.
So far, we've never seen such a shadow left behind, but it can be heard, even if they can't be seen.
Just imagine, in a real universe theory -- the two of them have existed together for a long time.
Maybe they were stars before, then they cut down two black holes -- each quality is 10 times the sun.
Now we're pushing them within 60 miles.
They can rotate hundreds of times per second.
At the end of life, they're close to each other with light.
In a few seconds, they can cross thousands of miles.
When the clouds and the universe are attacked, they're forced into space and spread.
These motions are broadcast rapidly in space.
This computer simulation was completed by the relatively small group of Goudads of the National Aviation Space Agency.
The solution was almost 30 years ago.
It's one of many teams.
It shows two black holes around each other, these are the lines in the picture.
As you can see -- maybe there's some ammo -- you can see it fired by red balls, these are exciting waves.
They're actually in the universe, and these sounds will spread rapidly out of these clouds, until these two clouds are integrated into one unit into a peaceful circle of clouds.
If you stand close enough, your ears will come together with these space pressures and radiation.
You can really hear these sounds.
Of course, you wouldn't help to find out what happened, too, your head was pressed and flat, so you probably couldn't understand what happened.
But I'm willing to play the sound we predicted for you.
It's my team's research results -- a relatively simple calculation model.
Imagine a smaller quality of black hole falling into a larger quality of black hole.
The sound you heard comes from a small-quality black hole in the process of approaching a large-quality black hole in space.
If they're far away, they'll sound very small.
But a loud voice becomes like a wave of motion, hitting space, moving space like a wave.
We can predict what this voice will turn into.
We know that in the process of falling down, small-quality black holes will become faster and the sound that is sent will be more bright.
Finally, we'll hear the little black hole completely down into the big black hole.
I never thought it sounded like that.
When I hear it at home, I feel that there's something that can't be done.
Sounds like, uh, uh, uh...
That's another sound that we're modeled by our research team.
I'm not going to show you a picture here, because the black hole won't leave any useful clues, and the real space won't show you those fake lines.
But if you hear this voice when you're lying in the universe, I suggest you run fast.
(Laughter) It'd be better if we could get away from this voice.
These two black holes are moving.
Two black holes are approaching each other.
In this case, they're all very proud.
Then they'll be integrated into one.
The sound of the bell is a sign of black hole integration -- when it's done, the sound of the bell will be sounded.
That's what we're going to do about what we're going to see.
Luckily, we're very safe in the capital.
I suspect two black holes in some part of the universe have been integrated together.
The same suspect is that the space around us can also feel these over a million light years, or from a million years ago, they're spreading rapidly and finally meeting us.
But these sounds are too small for us to hear.
Some of the world's experiments need a lot of blood to build together -- there's an experience called LIGO -- it's going to be able to detect a distance of less than one atomic nuclear range every four miles away.
It's a very complex experiment, its flexibility will not be exceeded in the next few years -- it'll be used to test space motions.
Another research project on the universe was expected to start in the next decade, called Lisa.
Lisa's gonna be able to see a super-quality cloud -- those are the sun's millions of times even hundreds of millions of times.
In a picture that we're looking forward to moving away from Ha' al-Qaida, we've seen these two stars.
Looks like they're stuck together.
Their center may have a high-quality super-black hole, respectively.
But they're not stopping. They're actually being integrated.
These two black holes will be hit, their integration will last for billions of years.
So the sound they send has gone beyond our human senses.
But Lisa can see that the last phase of the super-high-quality integrated cloud, which was 15 minutes before their integration, began early.
This exploration is not only limited to a cloud, it can also be used to detect any major disturbance in the universe -- the largest of which is the number of "the great explosions of the universe."
When this word was created, some people would say, "Oh, who would believe in the great explosion of the universe?"
This video that I've produced in my friends at Proton Studios shows the scene of a major explosion from the outside.
We would not really want to be like this; we want to be inside the universe, because there is no such thing as the universe.
So, imagine you're in a big explosion.
There's nowhere in the universe. The universe is around you.
It's been 1400 million years, and it's still ringing around us.
The stars gradually form a series of stars in a planet, and at least one such planet exists, suitable for life.
Here, we're crazy about building experiments, computing, writing computer code.
Imagine, billions of years ago, two black holes were intertwined.
This voice's been in the air all the time.
We're not even here.
It's getting closer - 40,000 years ago, we're still painting on the wall of the cave.
If the sound we're going to get is a huge explosion, it sounds like this.
Seriously, it's loud.
It's a white voice, a confused voice.
But it's nowhere around us, unless it's in the universe, some other processes are reversed.
If we can detect these sounds, it'll be like a normal music to our ears, because this quiet response comes from the universe that we're created, from the universe that we long for.
So in the next few years, we'll be able to increase the volume of these concerts a little bit, let the universe show us in the form of sound.
But if we can detect the earliest gaps, it will also make us more understanding the major explosions, enable us to track down some of the most difficult, and even more complex issues.
If we're going to play the universe, we can know that there's been a big explosion in the past, and we can even hear its complex sound, but is our big explosion the only major explosion in the universe?
I mean, we wouldn't stop asking if there had been a similar explosion before?
What about the future?
I would like to say that if we raise the meaning of this issue to this level of rethinking promoted by TED, at least in the last minute, we can ask some questions, those that we may never answer.
But we don't want to say that our universe won't be a part of a bigger story?
Or say we're not just a part of the universe -- each part has experienced its own huge explosion -- maybe some of them are just a bunch of dark holes, some of them aren't -- maybe there's a conscious life, some aren't there -- they're not our past, they're not our future, they're somehow connected to us?
So we can't stand to assume that if there's a multi-square universe, there's life in other parts of this multisquare universe?
This is our life in the universe.
Is there any other life in the multi-world that they wouldn't even assume of our existence, thinking of their own origin?
If that's true, I can imagine them as we do, computers, computer numbers together with test engines, trying to detect those tiny sounds that came from their origins, and suspect who else was there.
Thank you, everyone.
(Applause)
Engagement of professional art in the movement of goods in the market - New York
During the season of the school "Schooling" season, the weekend begins with a hard line of art.
However, it is not in the American Museum, nor in the school garden, but in public space in the capital city of Korea, and will be open to the public free of charge until 23 August.
Newspapers learned that this 2020-year-old art exhibition was collected from the Central American Academy of Art, 50-group works from the Chinese Media University and 57 young artists from the Gypsy American University of China, from 2nd level to 6th level, and a full-time exhibition of high-level works in the inner courtyard, with the highest level of coverage of the artistic season.
The significance of this exhibition was particularly evident under the circumstances.
The U.S. President of the United States of Korea made a statement: " We choose to take back the space under the line of the 'Georgian' graduation, and we want more young people to see their own research and understanding of the world and to enhance their artistic and mental healing powers for society and the mind. "
She revealed that this reference work had been collected to the graduates of several universities of art and had been selected from among them as an appropriate display of commercial space, from traditional paintings, sculptures, to new media devices, interactives, VRs, volume and wealth for the most important years.
In one of these, Liquor’s creative language, which was combined with mechanical and handicrafts in "The First War of 2020", expressed his feelings in this context; he studied "Sound Money" by means of works created by a bridge in the South Pacific; "Credential Creation", "Creation Creation", "Treativity" such as "Trade"; "Treaty" is often displayed by animals with a strong "Catholic" in nature, from which young artists can see the understanding of human relations; and the "Creation" works by fellow fishermen are a gift" for young people who remember growing up, "when they have a day's success, they remember that simple and true."
In a small number of self-exploited graduates, there are the honours of the grading system from the University of Zing-America.
"I arrived in Beijing on 7 July, at the time of the fact that I was a bit concerned about vaccination, and three days ago I conducted a nuclear test with alcohol and testing reports. "
His work" was more complex than the structure of the bridge yesterday, and he had to be a relative.
At the same time, he was also entrusted with the task of helping fellow students to repair damages.
"To show up at 4:00 a.m. and then make repairs, time is tight, forgets and works together, and is a little sad."
He hoped that as the vaccine became more stable, his fellow students would come to Beijing to see his work.
(Laughter)
Early that morning, 65-year-old Bosonaro posted a photo on TTTute, which he wore with his feet, without his pants, sat in front of a table with breakfast, smiles on his face, one hand raised his finger, and the other put on a box of antioxidants.
He writes in his introduction: "Good morning, everyone!
However, Bosonaro did not specify when this new virus transmission test was conducted.
On 5 July, Bosonaro experienced new lung cancer, six days of exposure to the results of the virus testing, and seven days of direct television he declared himself infected with new lung cancer.
On 14 and 21 days, Bosonaro conducted two tests of new vaccines, resulting in continued blindness.
During the period of separation, Bosonaro demonstrated through social media direct exposure to the use of chlorophylls, and said that chlorophyll was good for new vaccines, and that after their use it was good for them to recover from chlorophylls, and that the Brazilian medical authorities claimed to use new chlorophytosanitary vaccines.
According to Brazil media reports, there are still five ministers and 10 government ministers in Brazil who have been infected with new vaccines.
It's a small plane crashing up to four people on the plane -- a new network in Switzerland.
On 26 July, according to the EU Internet, the local time was announced to the media on 25 July by the Swiss police, and a small plane was destroyed on 25 July in the Swiss Alps.
Two Swiss and two Austrians were in the middle of the accident.
It was reported that a small aircraft destroyed more than 3,000 metres of the sea near Mount Al-Qaeda, in the state of Wallis, Switzerland, and that the rescue personnel were confirmed after the accident and that 4 of the passengers were involved were affected.
The State police in Vale indicated that the observer had called the police at 12.25 p.m. and that he had seen a small plane fall from the sky.
A few minutes later, the police were informed that the airport had fired.
Upon receipt of reports from the police, fire police officers, medical personnel and rescue personnel were promptly coordinated and the helicopter was loaded with emergency relief.
After the rescue personnel arrived at the airport, four of the four found it difficult.
The police verified that the victims of the accident included two Swiss persons aged 50 and 66 and two Austrians aged 46 and 50.
The police indicated that the police were currently working with the Swiss Transport Safety Investigation Committee to investigate the causes of the accident.
A new network in the 33 districts of the Great Rainbow is being launched.
On 26 July, the new Central Network re-enforced electricity (the journalist and the journalist) was informed by the city's Water Agency that over 24 hours ago, there were 33 districts, 16 of which were hit by heavy rains.
The heavy rain rescinded 71 rivers in the middle of the river, and two flood warnings had been issued in advance.
According to the city water stations monitoring the main water station, the heavy rains in most areas occur on 25 hours to 26 hours.
There were a total of 33 districts, including the village, the capital, the state, 16 districts, and the village. The largest day the rain falls is in the village of Mount Cinn, 197.5 mm.
There are between 1 and 7 metres of water in the middle of 71 rivers, such as the South American River, and the highest water is not over-protected.
It is expected that from 8 a.m. to 27 p.m., there may be a different degree of water flow in most regions, and that individual small rivers may occur in excess of the surface water.
At the same time, locals will be concerned about the long-distance and the potential floods of transit.
CBA welcomed the first audience after the race, and wanted to see what new networks are in the season.

On July 26th, CBA official news from the CBA was received by CBA at the end of the day for the first round of the competition.
On 31 July, the event included staff members moving to the island, as well as doctors, teachers, public security personnel, and groups of people who contributed more to society during the period of vaccination, during which the CBA was officially engaged in the post-serious season of the season, which would also be resuspended to the ball.
Infected by the vaccine, the CBA began its fight on 20 June, about five months after the interruption of the CBA.
Although there were few audiences on the 26th afternoon of the show, it was evident that there were people in the mood, while others were silent.
On the other hand, there is a relatively low level of resistance in the classroom, and such a picture has not been seen for many years.
At the end of the season, if you want to see the show, you'll notice it below.
This open-to-vote market is a diamond sports centre in the Isle of Yai Island, which is sold on the full-time line for real-time purchases, under the system of real-time registrations, all of which are 12 years old, and which has a certificate of nuclear acid testing within 48 hours.
It's a $50,000 prize. It's a "pre-warming first" show in the new network.
On 26 July, the North Sea newspaper (Linger) announced that the NZM had made a significant contribution to the warning of the tsunami, and that it had paid him $50,000.
At the same time, he was summoned by the Ministry of the Whole of the City Party to learn his full-fledged duty and to be bold and active as a volunteer spirit.
On 21 July, the sand dunes of the village of Luxembourg City of Nzburg made the river Seine River, the first to warn of the eruption, the 58-year-old.
On the afternoon of 17 July, it became clear that the wall had been broken down among the villagers and that it was immediately visited.
He just walked out of the house and saw the village group break off the street four feet [45 m], and the road was always extended to the graveyards, about 50 meters long.

New drug development at the University of Australia is intended for the treatment of new strains.
Researchers at the University of Monash, Australia, were developing a new drug to prevent heart disease and middle winds on 26 July, and hoped that such drugs could be used for the treatment of blood clots resulting from new vaccines.
Researchers found that one of the blood vessels would speed up blood clotting before or during surgery.
As a result, they developed a drug that could temporarily harden the blood vessels so as to avoid blood clots and prevent heart and heart disease.
Researchers have indicated that such drugs can only inhibit the blood clotting effect when there is a heart attack or a heart attack.
In view of the fact that similar blood clots have been shown to be one of the main causes of the death of newly diagnosed patients, researchers hope that such drugs can be used in the future for treatment of such patients.
At present, the drug has had a good effect in animal modeling and researchers are preparing to perform human-beding tests at the next stage.
Before the day of the study, it was published in the journal "Science and Translation Medicine" in the United States.
He became a CBA reconnaissance to allow the public to see the scene, and the first audience to enter.

New Hammer, New Hammer, New Hammer, New York City.
More than 6000 square feet [48 sq m] per square metre, a series of sequences, such as a color "to the sun", followed by the movement of the sun, the sun re-reflects the sun to a temperature of over 200 metres above the center and achieves electricity.
On the 25th day of the day, the journalist saw the radio station in the New Hamie-Hungary Lake, New Hampshire.
"The so-called hot-to-petroleum electricity is to focus the sun on the radiation from the surface of the sun into the heat of the absorbing heat and then turn it into energy through traditional power generation technologies. "
The Deputy Director-General for Central and Central Tehamian limited power companies has submitted that their design principles are similar to that of the sun used in rural areas of the North-West China.
The radio station opened construction in October 2017, reached and networked at 6600 square metres last year, with a total planned installation of 14,500 fixed days.
" In comparison with traditional solar technology, its maximum advantage is to store the heat that can be collected and to generate electricity at night. "
It was bold to say that the 13-hour storage system that the project was set up could keep the CDM stable and not be affected by the change in light; it could also be able to engage quickly in electronic communications based on the needs of the web.
After the project has been fully built, it can achieve an annual output of more than 198 million tonnes, with an annual saving rate of over 60,000 tons of carbon dioxide, 60 tons of carbon dioxide, some 20 tons of carbon dioxide, more than 15 million tons of carbon dioxide, and a continuous supply of clean energy for local sources.
In addition, there is another color "to the East Bank" in the mining industry in the city of Hammy.
The Humphrey Sun power stations consisting of more than 2,300 litres of solar power stations, and 714 installed electric equipment, similar to the orbit of the sun, will always keep the sun and the sun on its 90th horizon.
" We use two-way tracking technologies to keep electricity efficiency in line with the high-level adjustment of the sun by combining control. "
The station's long-term dream was that, under good weather conditions, the more traditional electricity generation technology could increase by around 20 per cent.
In the first half of this year, the power station has reached more than 7 million electricity levels and has been complemented by local electricity requirements.
The city's lighting industry is currently the largest size of the new unit, the largest of which is the most complete type of lighting industry model area, together with 38 electricity projects in the lighthouse, totaling 820,000.
In the first half of this year, electricity production increased by over 11 million and increased by 6 per cent over the same period as 2019.
Hammy is one of the best areas of China's solar resource conditions.
The average annual solar radiation is more than 6200 meters per square metre, which is approximately 3200 hours per day.
In recent years, the city's highly developed light industry has been "to the West Bank".
The solar power output of 250 billion units has been built, which is over 14 billion electricity in the first half of the year, compared to about 14 per cent of the growth.
Currently, over 330 stations in New York and the Internet have more than 10 billion.
It is expected that this year, light emitting electricity will reach 150 million degrees and that the standard will be replaced by more than 60 million tons.
The police are still working on the New York Network.
On July 26th of New York City, the following day, "A student of a university went missing after a visit to Green Heagle trees" was interviewed by netizens.
On 26 June, the Ministry of Public Security of the Hasimongo People ' s Republic of China reported that a student at a University of Nuningi was still in a state of disengagement, and several police were on the inside of a block of disengagement and were actively looking for work.
On 10 July 2020, the Security Council of the City of Germ, Hessey, informed the security forces at the above level that a student of the University of Nunyin was riding Z164 cars from Ninkin to Germ on 5 July, and asked for help in searching for a telephone service at the South-West River-West Region of South-West Water Protection Station, Ningle Soondaj City, on 9 July.
According to an investigation by the City of Germ City Security Board, a man entered the province of Günther on 6 July 1954 and arrived at the city of Germ on 4 a.m.
On that day, at 8 p.m., the missing persons had been able to ride out of the train some time by train from the G109 Grand Hotel in the city of Germ, and at 12 p.m., they had been able to get to the police station in Calison and the train driver had returned alone, leaving at least 7 p.m. to the clean water station near Daj. until 9 p.m. in the region.
In the further investigation, the police found something that had happened at 1707 hours on 13 July through the Jingi checkpoint.
The Chungjii checkpoint is an inspection station established in the city of the City of the Secrecy, in the south of the city of Germ, and because the inspection station is not able to determine its personal and vehicle information, the police can only search along the road and coordinate the search of the checkpoints on the side of the Cecile if they find something, and contact the city's Public Security Agency immediately.
According to the latest situation, on 26 July at 1 p.m., the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for the Development of Crimea (UNHCR) took relief equipment and went to the Entrepreneur's Protection Station on the dried road, to search the Sundaja Protection Station and to actively seek contact with the Shilling Police, the West Bank and the South Korean Police, and to work together to pursue rescue work.
The local police wanted to find out something early about the missing persons, such as the relevant guidelines, and provide them with time-bound information to the law enforcement and the law enforcement authorities in South China.
At the same time, the relevant experts indicated that visitors had to be regular, rational, civilized, always keeping alerts on the road, risking access to unattended areas, meeting emergencies and reporting on time.
The U.S. media has opened a new network of truth in the capital of Houston, China.
2020-07-26 14:40:44 Source: Central Network Author: Judiciary Editor: Judiciary: Judiciary
The U.S. media has opened up the truth that China has been forced to shut down in Houston.
On 24 days, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China informed the United States Embassy that China had decided to abolish the establishment and operation of the United States General Council and to request that it cease all operations and activities as a countermeasure for the United States of America to be closed on 21 May as a matter of urgency.
The United States Government is concerned about this act, which has been challenged by foreign media and scholars.
Why did the Chinese ask for the closure of the capital?
Many external media claim that it is still unclear why the United States would elect China's capital in Houston, but for the purpose of this movement, the external media has stated directly: for the general election.
The U.S. television news network (CNN)23 reported that the United States demanded that China shut down its campaign in Houston General Assembly.
The article states that the United States Government ' s response to the disaster of new immunization has resulted in a lower rate of support for President Tranpu before the General elections.
The White House officials claim in private that the strong strategy for China is to save Tranup's support rate and also to transfer the responsibility for the removal of whitepox vaccines to respond to failure.
The article considers that the Chinese General Assembly in Houston is a "political drive" chosen by the United States and a very cautious " goal," and the US Government has chosen it "to develop a strong attitude and avoid the risk of major conflicts".
The British Broadcasting Company (BBC) also believes that while the U.S. economy is at the time of the U.S. elections, while the United States economy has been severely affected by the epidemic, Tranup believes that 'the Chinese card' has political advantages'.
The current situation is "an upward trend and a relative struggle", which, to some extent, has been promoted by the United States Government from its national perspective, only will the tension between Central America deteriorate.
The United States Columbia Broadcasting Company (CBS) reported that Tranup's future was under pressure because of the outbreak of the epidemic and that he was again accused of being immunized by the vaccine.
The United States has almost every day a new action aimed at the so-called "China Exploitation of the United States".
"It's very important to build two countries in Houston. "
The United States commented that the United States had requested China to close its headquarters in Houston to increase the tension between the two largest economies in the world.
In addition to the impact of the diplomatic aspects of the closure of the Chinese General Hospital in Houston, it is also difficult for US citizens seeking visas and other services to find access to consular services in the South of the United States.
One business group in Houston regretted the United States ' request to close China to the Houston General Assembly and said that the General Assembly had played an important role in the establishment of trade, investment and cultural links in both countries.
The United States believes that this reflects the importance of China ' s economy.
The U.S. Foreign Policy Web site believes that this American initiative is part of a series of challenging initiatives, which will only undermine the relationship between the United States.
The Road Society appealed to Professor Johnson Polak of East Asia of the U.S. University of Chicubrukins, who, since the establishment of a comprehensive diplomatic relationship between the two countries of the United States of America in 1979, did not want any action to be taken against the United States of America's headquarters in Houston.
Hong Kong " South-West News " reports that this movement of America has not existed in the more than 40-year diplomatic relations between two Central American countries.
Analysts believe that this movement could cause lasting damage.
China's capital in Houston was built in 1979, the first capital of China, which was established in the United States.
Currently, China has a embassy and five headquarters in the United States.

Speaker at the British Hotel: The Government of China is a strong supporter of network security - new network
On 26 July, China's Chinese Ambassador to the British Embassy, 25 July, China's spokesman at the British Embassy, questioned the respondents about the network's attack on the wrong reporters.
The speaker stressed that the Government of China was a strong defender of network security and consistently opposed and combated any form of network assault and network crime.
Some journalists asked: According to the media, terrorist organizations associated with China had interrupted an British company's network system, launched attacks on British technology companies with patented data and penetrated into the EU's national government network.
The speaker stated that the Government of China was a strong defender of network security and consistently opposed and combated any form of network assault and network crime.
There should be sufficient evidence to be found in the case of investigations and definition of networks that cannot be proved without any suspicion.
The speaker said that a series of events, such as the former "Shutland " , have proved that the United States has been carrying out its most global network-wide secretion.
Peace and stability in the space of the Network are in common interest in all countries.
The speaker noted that China ' s achievements in scientific innovation were not stolen, not stolen, but made it hard to fight through its own strength.
In 2019, China submitted approximately 5.9% of its applications through the "Credentials Cooperation Treaty" (PCT) and an annual growth rate of 10.6 per cent became the largest country in the submission of international patent applications.
China has become a major power for innovation and intellectual property.
In the first half of the first year, the Chinese People ' s Bank has shown that the new increase in loans involving agriculture and microenterprises has increased throughout the year 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Bank used a wide range of monetary policy tools to lead the banking industry to increase its lending capacity and provide adequate financial guarantees for vaccine prevention and recovery.
The majority of Urumium-free testing areas have been essentially completed twice as new in high-risk areas.
On 26 July, Urumy's new Internet power plant (The Journal of the United Nations) was protected by the Urumese City Health Commission on 26 July, informing of the latest vaccinations and nuclear acid testing in the city of Urumqi, the majority of Urumqi's nuclear-sodium-free testing areas are currently fully completed.
The State Service Group of Experts and the Self-Government Areas, Urumazi, experts are further assessing the development of vaccines based on the results of the nuclear tests and epidemics.
The press release will inform New Guinean vaccination and prevention on 26 May.
According to him, from 25 July to 24 July, 22 new cases of new lung cancer in the city of Urumati (of which 5 of them were transfused as non-communicable infections) and 38 new cases of non-communicable infections were reported.
As at 2430 hours on 25 July, 135 cases of infectious diseases in the city of Urumqi were present and 147 cases of non-communicable infections were reported.
The new 25-day non-communicable infections were also mainly identified through the city-wide free testing of carbon dioxide.
On 26 July, the Director of the Urumazi City Health Commission said that most of the areas of work on the free testing of nuclear acid throughout the city of Urumati had been essentially completed.
He also said that from experience in other parts of the country, there were many factors that affected the results of the testing of nuclear acids, such as the flexibility of testing agents, the time of infection and the time of removal of the test personnel, the comparability of the tester when taking materials (probably due to the lack of location) and the level of professional training of the test personnel.
For various reasons, a nuclear test would also result in false results.
The so-called falsity means that the tested person is indeed infected, but the results of the test are fragility.
In addition, there is a need for two nuclear tests to be excluded for cases of infectious diseases and suspected cases of such diseases.
For individuals at high risk of infection, there may be a possibility of fragility in a nuclear test if there is an outbreak of fever and respiratory symptoms, and there is also a need for two nuclear tests to be excluded.
He said that, in view of the above situation, for the physical health of the entire population of the city, the city of Urumazi would have begun to conduct two free testing of nuclear oxygen for mountain areas, such as the Saf Al-Bak region, while conducting "Research forpossessment".
It has been reported that the mountain range, Sa al-Bak district, is a high-risk area of vaccination.
The "hot" line is streaming through a new network of international films on the sea through unusual industrial confidence.
2020-07-26 06:52:39 Source: Text-to-speech Author: King-Speech Editor: King-Speech
The "hot" on the top line, the international film series over the sea through unusual industrial confidence.
The present report (Chief of the Prime Journal) yesterday opened a large screen for the twenty-third International Film Festival, which was held in the context of the 2020 International Films Forum, in the context of strict vaccination measures.
As the first international film show to be held since the continued proliferation of global vaccines and the normalization of my country ' s vaccine control, this year's international film festival was significant.
On the basis of regularization of vaccine control, the international film series on the sea is a credible and more determined declaration — our faith in fighting vaccines has not changed, our faith in people's day has not changed, the global video creation centre has been built, and the belief in "the culture of the sea" cards has not changed.
The annual International Film Festival at the Upper Sea was once again released and began to be an innovative and growing trend.
It is therefore necessary to take steps to meet the high-quality development services of the industry in order to meet the people ' s spiritual needs.
This year's more like it.
In order to appreciate the difficult situation of vaccine control, the International Film Series on the Sea requires serious vaccine prevention measures to be implemented in detail; on the other hand, it is a combination of intelligence for China's film creation and a vision of video-visiting needs, opening up on-line and multi-table activities.
On the first day of the opening, from the under-line to the industrial forum, the relevant activities of the film series were strictly implemented by the relevant prevention policies.
The Forum's activities are controlled within 50 persons and each video station is separated, with a maximum of 30 per cent.
As the film group committee held, in any case, "the safety and physical health of the population is the first one " .
It's very simple under the line. It's a lot hot.
In order to follow the initiative "The people of the city, the cities of the people as people" and as a festival of the people, this year's International Film Programme is an innovation and a request for transformation, using "the performance", "the participation" of the Great Teachers, to meet the various needs of the audience.
On the first day of the opening, the official partners of the film show filming videos and the first half-year-old filming, according to a series of "one" videos", were filming back.
On the night, the Golden Open Forum was also in the Central Video and the Jaguac Teachers' work, learning from strong countries, creating a number of platforms, such as App, and bringing hundreds of people to the attention of the latest trends in Chinese film.
At the opening forum yesterday, members of the Central Radio General Television Group, the Deputy Director-General, spoke openly and announced the opening of this film show, the Committee of the Marines, the Minister of the Ministry of Public Affairs, and the Vice-Presidents were present.
Vaccination expert Fuchi: Caution for the development of vaccines early in 2021
The above statement was made at a video conference organized by the International Capital Fund on 25 February.
He recalled that it is not yet clear how new vaccines will develop during winter and what the final impact of vaccination will be," and that the only way to end all of this is that we all choose to be part of the problem."
According to U.S. University of Johns Hopkins, as of 25 hours, the new U.S. emergency cases have reached 417,6 million and 14.6 million people have died.
Fuchi stated that some regions in the United States are currently struggling with anti-immunition.
Despite differences in field conditions, there is a need for targeted response programmes, but diversification strategies do not mean close links between regions.
Vaccinations in one region will eventually affect other regions.
"Now is not the time for self-sustainment," Fuch said, "our work has not been completed, we must intensify our efforts, and we must remain alert to the uncertainty of the future. "
U.S. medical experts, the founder of the "Drug Drug Treatment Act" of AIDS, noted at the meeting that the United States has not yet reached the end of the epidemic.
"We all have to do our best to slow down the spread of this virus."
It was called upon that the public would take time for scientists to develop new drugs and vaccines through their actual actions.
The International Capital Fund is a non-profit organization aimed at promoting international exchange activities in the United States and in the Asia-Pacific region, committed to the promotion of the status of the United States of America and the development of international youth leaders.
On that day, the Minister for Transport of the United States spoke at a meeting, such as the Minister for Transport of the United States, the Federal Parliamentary Member of the United States and the President of the International Leadership Foundation.
They are particularly grateful to Asian medical workers and volunteers who are on one line of vaccines and call upon the United States public to continue to adhere to prevention standards such as "social distance " and to prevent the spread of vaccines.
There are no new cases of local infectious diseases, 24 new cases of non-communicable infections - New York.
News from New York City on 25 July and 25 July, on 25 July, and from 15 July to 25 July, on 24 July to 14 July, revealed that there were no new cases of local lung cancer, and no new cases of non-communicable infections.
From 22 to 25 July, 12 cases of local tuberculosis have been reported throughout the city, focusing on the treatment of separation in the 6th public hospital of the city.
The Deputy Director-General of the Municipal Health Commission for Health said that according to the case of vaccination, the city had organized more than 600 sampling points in the area of the city's third-level medical community in the street community, in the district of Maine, the village of workers, along the riverside, and in the Kimpu region, and had been working to promote the nuclear acidification of people and that nearly 2,000 patients were conducting a daily nuclear testing.
As at 1430 hours on 25 July, the entire city had a total population of 21,000.
In the present 12 case cases, 10 case cases are identified as limited company workers in the World Ocean Strip of the Great Lakes; in the case of 54 cases, 46 case cases are the company's staff and its relatives; in all cases, the business staff and its relatives are 85 per cent.
After the trial, the General Assembly decided to strengthen strict control of all staff members of the World Ocean Strip of Great Lakes and close contact with all staff members of the United States of America, and to concentrate on the implementation of 14 days of separate medical observations and at least two nuclear tests.
At the same time, the General Assembly decided to further expand the implementation of the scope of central medical observers and to include at least 2 nuclear-related inspections of communicable individuals (such as disease and non-communicable infections) and the full implementation of 14 days of communicable medical observations by close contactes.
The General Airport, the Grand Railway Station, issued a notification every 25 days that the implementation of the principle of non-reconnection of all city personnel is not necessary and that it is necessary to be connected and must have 7 days of nuclear test evidence; the General Railway Station has been suspended throughout the city by 12 hours from the 25th day.
Brazil's study showed that CFCs are not effective in treating new vaccines.
Recently, a Brazilian study showed that HCBV was not effective in dealing with new cancer patients.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The U.S. Trade Representative to deliver the August meeting.
The Hong Kong "Sunwarn Morning News" was quoted by a prominent informant as head of the Chinese Trade Negotiating Group, co-chairman of the State Department and U.S. Army, who was expected to hold formal meetings on August and to assess the performance of the first phase of the United States trade agreement between the two parties.
It is reported that although China has significantly increased the number of agricultural products purchased in the United States over the past few months, the number of commitments made by China in the trade agreement remains one step away due to factors such as new HIV infection.
Analysts said that recent closures in the United States of America, as well as other disputes, could undermine any progress made by both parties in trade.
The first phase of the trade agreement in Central America entered into force one month after the signature of 15 January, in which it provided for a high-level trade framework group composed of both sides, which should hold a meeting every half year.
The informed persons revealed that this meeting would be "an important turning point", enabling both parties to assess the progress of the agreement.
However, the person also said that if tensions in the United States led to a lack of willingness to speak at this time, both parties might agree that the telephone meetings held on 8 May, i.e. one-half of which had been met every year in the trade agreement.
Since this year, relations between the United States and Central America have deteriorated rapidly, including a series of issues such as the origin of new vaccines, trade, Hong Kong, New Zealand, the South Sea and the Idea.
President Tranpe of the United States changed his attitude in spite of the achievements he had achieved in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year.
He said at the 23rd White Journalist that although China had recently purchased a record of U.S. mercury, it also bought a lot of paper, "but this trade agreement is now my meaning, it is not as it was when it was first arrived."
A prominent government adviser to Beijing also believes that because of the poor relations between America and America, a new round of trade negotiations are not very likely to take place, "The issue of trade between the United States has lost its share of relations".
However, he revealed that China ' s 23-day trade-related unit continued to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "We have done our best, so any additional procurement will be difficult".
The Vice-Chairperson of the National Trade Commission in the United States of America said that keeping the first phase agreement "is more important than ever" and that China has made progress this year in opening up financial markets to the United States.
An independent research firm analyst, Plenum, said: "It's not better to talk, even if it's only possible to act as a public service. "

The Chief Representative of the Nasdak China Region: now is the best time segment of China's company IPO -- Economic Observations - Professional Financial Information Website
Economic Observatory Newspapers Because of the Russian coffee counterfeiting incident, the U.S. market has imposed more strict regulation on the central unit, as well as long-term pressure on the value of the value added, pressure on the unit in the United States cities, pressure on the Internet, and the recent opening of the blockage in Kyoto.
It's a very short time. It's like a car company. It's hot in the city.
Are China's businesses now the best time in the city under the crisis?
"In the case of recent IPOs and subsequent companies, it is not of any nature that IPOs have been affected, but now the market is very good and even now the best time for China's IPO companies last 10 years. "
The head of the Chinese district of Nasdak, which is in the Nasdak, said at the "Communication Unit of the Citizens of the Citizens of the City Company in 2020" held by Snowball.
In April of this year, the U.S. Credentials Board (SEC) and the Public Company Accounting Board (PCAOB) issued " an important statement on audit quality and control of access to audits and other international information - the challenge of accessing information currently available to U.S. municipal companies with a large number of operations in China".
This statement states that, although international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, the United States regulatory authorities continue to exist in terms of access to information, SEC and PCAOB continue to face legal and practical challenges; compared with the document, the PCAOB website lists the top-ranking companies and their audit agencies, which are listed in a large number of companies.
In addition, in May this year, the Senate of the United States Congress adopted "the Foreign Company Account Act", which provided additional information to foreign companies in the United States City.
It appears that the overall crisis in the unit did not affect investors' mouths.
" This news has caused fear for all, and it is not possible for all to go to the United States in the future, but we have discovered that these issues are not the case with investors, that investors may ask these issues even as a standardized issue in recent American IPO events, but that is not the important reason why they are not invested in a Chinese company.
It is recommended that everyone look at the current situation with as much interest as possible.
Of course, this appearance may seem to be the most serious situation in the past two years, but there is no impact on the investor ' s mouth.
So from now on or before the end of this year or the U.S. elections, U.S. IPO's heat will continue. "
On 9 May this year, Kinshasa was officially established in Nasdak City, U.S.A., and became the first Chinese company to sell IPO.
"The top of the town of Kinshasa is a very large trust for China's company that prepares IPO for the back. "
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

It is interesting to note that China's IPO's quality for the first half of this year, with strong basic and growing quality companies, will be more attractive to investors.
From a short, medium and long term perspective, IPO continues to have a positive attitude toward the Chinese company.
"The short term is that the heat of U.S. IPO is still continuing; the medium term is that China's company has more options, Unit A, Port Unit, Unit of America, all will consider the U.S. and Central America's choice as market choices and time factors; for a long time, everything will return to normal, the market's fluctuations are cycled, both political cycles and economic cycles, and finally return to normal stages and the city is always ahead of movement."
At the same time, he said, "There are no more factors to be determined this year, but for quality companies, no matter whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are genuine and have the potential for growth of investors, the other factors are relatively necessary, while investors need better investment.

People's Day commentators: focusing on their own affairs and building new priorities for the future — on learning how to work closely with the Competitiveness of the Business Conference - Newwave Network
E-mail 25 July Beijing People's Day Commentary article 26 July: The focus of the efforts to do things their own way and to develop new priorities for the future
At present, global epidemics and the world economic situation remain very complex, and our country has not had the challenges to face.
Maintaining strategic strength, building confidence and focusing on doing things our own is key to our meeting various risk challenges.
At a recent business conference, the NAP noted that, in the current protectionist rise, the global economy is undermining, the external environment that is undermining global markets, we need to focus our efforts on doing our own things, fully taking advantage of the country's over-largest market advantages, gradually forming a topically-oriented new forms of development in the country ' s internal circle, increasing the level of modernization of industrial chains, stimulating technological innovation, speeding up key core technology attacks and developing new advantages in the future.
The wise man, the prudent man, the chosen man.
In the outer environment of deep economic globalization, markets and resources have played an important role in my country's rapid development "outside.
Now, the world under the epidemic is experiencing a profound change, facing more unstable factors, economic globalization is facing the backdrop and the backbone.
A better time to prepare and work to respond to the idea of change in the external environment, to promote the deterioration of our economy, and to move away from it, a very important aspect is to make the expansion and meeting national needs as a strategic basis for development, to take full advantage of its own advantages, to increase its domestic momentum for economic development through the prosperous domestic economy, and to increase its momentum for our country ' s economic development.
We need to be deeply aware of the construction of a complete internal system of needs, the relationship between long-term development and long-term peace.
The status of the Party ' s central trial situation, which clearly provides a firm implementation of an expanded internal need strategy, is the need to respond to the outbreak of vaccines, to the need to maintain the sustained health development of our country ' s economy and to meet the needs of the people for the growing beauty of life.
The advantages of the economy of the country are internally circular.
Our country has the largest global integrity, the largest industrial system, strong production capacity, improved packaging capacity, more than 10 million market subjects and more than 17 million people who are highly educated or professionally skilled, including over 14 billion people, including over billion middle-income groups, are in the new industrialization, informationization, urbanization, rapid development of agriculture and investment demand potential.
Public governance is the subject of all forms of economic joint development, the distribution of labour in many ways and the survival of the socialist fundamental economic system, such as the socio-economic system of the socialist market economy, which can promote the empowerment of all types of market actors, the release and development of social productivity and promote efficiency and equal opportunities and continue to achieve common wealth.
We would like to put this strategic base in place, to increase production and distribution, to improve the quality of domestic markets, to make clear the strategic direction for structural reform, and to promote a greater level of mobility balance of overall delivery and demand.
In order to accelerate the construction of an integrated internal system, to promote technological innovation and other aspects of innovation, to accelerate the progress of the digital economy, smart manufacturing, life-health and new materials, to create more new growth points, to increase growth, to become a topically topical, and to promote new forms of development across the country.
Open it up. Close it up. It's gonna fall.
The NEPAD noted several times that the open door of China would not be closed, but would only be further expanded.
It is not a matter of shutting down the door of operation through the internal market and international markets, but of making better use of two international domestic markets and two resources to strengthen more sustainable development through the use of domestic and international potential.
At the same time, there is no conflict between the expansion of domestic needs and the expansion of openness, the expansion of the internal circle, and the promotion of the establishment of an open new architecture, and the promotion of participation in international cooperation and new competitive advantages.
While international protectionism is now on the rise, we need to stand on the right side of history, continue to deepen reform, expand openness, strengthen open cooperation in the field of science and promote the development of an open world economy and promote the building of a community of human life transport.
China has experienced many difficulties in its history, but it has never been pressured, but it has been the courage to grow up through difficulties.
On the way forward, there is strong leadership at the centre of the country ' s central party, with close ties to equality, a great advantage of China's special socialism system, a strong mobility capacity and a strong comprehensive strength, a united struggle for all the peoples of the whole country, and we must be able to overcome all the difficult obstacles, maintain our country's economic well-being, fully building a healthy society, and successfully open up the new national agenda for the full construction of modern socialism!
What about the balance of the proceeds of the "90s" against the "repetitious" money?
As the balance is earned, "90" has not only escaped the balance value, but started "repealable" money?
In the first half of the first half of the year, the Chinese New Economic Research Institute, which has jointly paid off the " 90-dollar balance report " (2020), showed that "90-year-old" was more expensive: the amount of money was almost four times the growth in 2019.
In fact, after '90', it's more likely to start from a 'small money', which is six per cent of every dollar worth of money under 20 cents...
It's worth the rest of the money, and it's like "90."
Data show that among the remaining 70 million users, 1.34 million users are "after 90".
China has 174 billion "90s" -- that is, about three out of four "90s" for the rest of the country.
At present, the annual income rate of the 7-day fund, such as the balance sheet, is higher than 2 per cent from the start of the year and has dropped to about 1.5 per cent.
Even so, there was no impact on the pace of the '90' money.
In the context of the increase in the value of the balance, it is not uncommon for young people who use the balance value to be converted directly into "citizens".
The payment of valuable data shows that, as at 13 July, nearly a month's pay for the new "kids" is more than the growth, and more and more young people are paying for "increasing" financial assets.
There were analysts who believed that funding was a major cause of a clear decline in the share of the MFF from the balance sheet in the market.
The report also shows that "90" women tend to spend more money on average than men and that 6 of the users with funds on the pay platform are men and women tend to choose a more stable financial method.
After saving the money, what's the plan after "90"?
The payment of valuable data shows that "90" is customary for the purpose of making money and that most users will travel as money targets.
Many "90" money was used to prepare for post-mortem journeys; the film industry was restored and new ways to move from money to consumption.
Let the side of the party stand high on the wall.
In recent years, our South-South has been affected by continuous flooding, which is very severe in the fight against floods, resulting in the destruction of 26 provinces (areas, cities) of the state, the Black Sea, the South Sea, the Great Sea, the Far East and the North.
Disasters are orders, disaster zones are the battlefields, disaster fronts, party flags are the battlefields, organizations at different levels, the Ministry of the Great Party, the People's Defence Forces are firmly committed to the implementation of the important spirit of the Global Register of Disaster Prevention, the rapid entry into the first line of prevention of disaster risk relief, becoming the main pillar of the population in the disaster, and the life force of fighting in the area.
The party's flag stands high on the hill, and it is an expression of loyalty and a call to the mission.
Before the disaster, one party organization was a fighter and one party member was a flag.
On a cross-border front line, organizations at all levels, large-scale parties' departments show high loyalty to the party, listen to the call from the party's central call to "look at my" action, "come with me" the courage of "I" and build a stand-by-the-way bridge, which is a very unstoppable Chinese bridge.
The party's flag stands high on the hill, standing on the ground, as well as on the corner of the hill.
In the face of the floods, the rapid action of all levels of party organizations, the outbreak of the "Hungary", which has been put on the scale of the conflict, the Ministry of the Great Party, the People's Defence Force, remains firmly in the position of the opposition, with "The Party's will and action" being the most important and most reliable obstacle to the people of the disaster area.
The party's flag is very proud of the country's flag, its private dedication and its responsibility.
In times of crisis, at the moment when the people's lives are threatened with serious threat, the Ministry of the Party, the People's Defence Forces, all concerned, without privacy, and in the face of being forced to fight this difficult battle, as a whole test capacity, as a wind, a safe haven, access to the military, is such a private and self-sustained spirit that is very encouraging to the faith and determination of the people in the disaster, combined with a strong spirit of the fight against the disaster.
"People up to life up to" is both tested at the same time and more critically tested at the same time.
On the anti-Hunga River, the Ministry of the Great Party and the People's Defence forces are always trying to keep the people from seeing the red flag, fighting the image, encouraging the voice to add to the party's flag with unquenchable sand!

France Larger Military Intakes of Space-Newwave
The French Minister for Defence, Florence Pali, said on 24th, that France would add billions of european defence budgets to the development of space military forces to prevent " unfriendly movement " from being carried out outside space by other countries.
During the period from 2019 to 2025, the budget for expenditure on the French military projects will increase from €36 billion (about $42 billion) previously developed to €43 billion ($500 million).
In accordance with the French Parliament's Military Planning Act of 2019 to 2025, France is expected to update the existing observation and communication satellites in the future, launching 3-electronic audio-visual satellites to improve the modern level of Rada's monitoring of space.
French President Emmanuel Mackron announced last July that the French Air Force would establish the Department of Military Commands and the Air and Space Force within the French Air Force.
Pali said that she would formally declare the establishment of this space force when she later arrived at a military school in the Provincial District.
Pali said this space force belonged to the air forces and 500 people were prepared before 2025.
She said: "In the past, it was thought that space served the common interests of science, and that the idea was never repeated, now that space is a place where nations are fighting global sovereignty. "
Pali reiterated the pre-Makron appearance, claiming that the French did not want to launch an arms race.
"We're never in the arms race, but I have a responsibility to know exactly what threats we may face."
Pali reimbursed on the monitoring of military satellites common to France and Italy in 2017.
She says, "Cruit money" is a Russian satellite.
The Russians rejected that statement.
Parly says that France will soon have a small patrol satellite capable of detecting and blocking those who are unfriendly behind the blacks.
The French media believed that because of France's quest for the establishment of a space force, U.S. President Donald Tranpe requested the United States Department of Defence to draft a law on the establishment of a space military.
Tranun-Pu signed the National Defence Authority Act last December and ratified the establishment of the sixth major United States Army — the Space Force.
Some experts are concerned that these United States initiatives have accelerated the U.S. militaryization pace and may lead to a new round of space arms competition.

On July 26th, the new Internet re-enacted a limited company from China's railways to China's limited company, which ran the entire line of approximately 189 000 square miles [18.9 sq km] of high-powered triangular traffic.
It is understood that the triangular triangles are not only the longest high-speed tunnels within the three-storey area, but also in the projects currently being built within the country, which are designed to reach 350 km/h.
In the south of the River, North of Lakes, in the outback of the triangular city, in the north of Tokyo, in the south of the state, and in the south, in the south of Vanuatu, are an important component of our "eight-and-eight-eight" high-speed railways and the way to Winan.
It's been a full 26-day line of high-speed triangular traffic.

The first phase of the operation was opened on 1 December 2019, and the second phase was accelerating the development of construction.
The 26-year-old triangular line is a total of 100,000 high-speed full-line control projects, which are located at the re-entering city border with the mountain range, covering about 18.9 km, and up to 890 metres.
The tunnel began its construction in February 2017 and was completed on 26 July 2020.
According to the United Nations Highway Design Team of the Designor Group of the China Central Engineering Group, the government of the Kingdom of China has a limited responsibility to design, according to the fact that there are very complex geographical conditions in the location of small triangular channels, facing the risks of rock, mud water, high-risk tunnels, high-risk tunnels, road design and construction.
"In the construction of the project, we use geo-research legislation, over-geographical projections such as the exploration of objects and pre-exploration law, and special design programmes have been undertaken for the remaining 30 types of holes.
According to the construction industry, when the construction of the tunnel was done, the construction of the tunnel was guided in a manner that guided the construction of the dam through the construction of the dam, the construction of the dam, the strengthening of the pipeline structure and the construction of the water treatment station, both ensured the orderly progress of the project and avoided the destruction of the build-up of the water bodies of the triangular area, while successfully overcoming the poor soil, such as the long 7 km of the well, with a maximum rainfall of 15.7 million cubic metres per day.
After the construction of a total of 100,000 high-speed vehicles, it will become our central route in the South-West region, and in the north, the new fast-speed passenger route in the North-East region, the improvement of road capacity and quality in the North-West region, the completion of the regional road network, the accelerated development of road resources and urbanization processes, and the promotion of regional coordination development and the promotion of the implementation of a major Western development strategy.
Experts say that the collection of migration information through the U.S. census will be used for the distribution of public seats in public halls
Several civil rights organizations and several U.S. cities and villages accused the United States Federal Government of attempting to exclude migrants without proof of being incorrigible outside the U.S. population census.
The census of the U.S. population will decide to allocate the seat of the United States Parliamentary Assembly.
The U.S. Free Alliance of Civil Rights Acting Lawyer Sarah Brant said to the United States, " It is not necessary to do so. "
She then said that it was difficult to determine the citizenship of those who accepted the census in the census, and " it was not reliable. "
Another civil-liberal co-operation organization presented its proceedings on Thursday, challenging the administrative order of Tranup.
In New Jersey, some towns in Georgia have joined the proceedings.
Alington, Virginia, joined the proceedings on Friday.
The President of the board of directors of Al-Qaeda said, "The Constitution of the United States requires that every 10 years our population be properly cleaned, and we must be clean to everyone living in Al-Qaida, and cannot allow this illegal attempt to scare the people and suppress the number of immigrants we are in. "
Other organizations and individuals praised President Tranup ' s administrative order.
The Minister of Justice of the state of Alabama said that the order was a "victory" of the state.
He said, "When the seats of the Assembly of the Assembly and the electoral missions are divided into states, there must be a number of people living in each state and those who are legally resident. "
Last year, the Supreme Court of the United States prevented the Taranup Administration from incorporating the issue of citizenship into the 2020 census.
President Tranup signed an administrative order earlier this week, which ordered the Minister of Commerce of the U.S. Population Survey to submit data on the uncertified population censuses, in order to exclude these uncertified populations from the census figures in all states and thus to determine that each state is either to increase or reduce or to retain the seat of the House of Assembly.
Every 10 years, the United States will relocate its seats according to population change.

Moving on, promoting industrial project construction-focused articles- South Lakes Journal Network-Water online
Hot Lake South, hot face.
On the other hand, the construction of industrial projects throughout the province promotes the enthusiasm for the release of present-day vision and covers three-day coolness, "in terms of industrial strength and the clear direction of the project in terms of heroism".
South-South development is always dependent on building projects, agriculture.
In the face of a very unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the central party of the Middle East as a core party, a circle was held throughout the province, worked hard to protect the vaccine and protect the two pillars and the industrial project as a "first-hand" for the implementation of the "Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Six-Sided".
From one quarter of GDP fell by 1.9 per cent, from the first half to the first half of the first year to the growth by 1.3 per cent, the difficulty of the period, the intensity of efforts, and the lack of words.
In this valuable achievement list, industrial projects are being built to speed up economic recovery in the South and to develop stability to the best key pillars.
It's positive, it's irreversible.
Industrial projects are built to be put into large sizes of the General Assembly, which are better in position, circumstances, circumstances, and in terms of knowledge, demand, and should be changed.
In the complex context of the current international situation, it is also necessary to study the new features of the current situation with a silent mind, more prudent and more scientific efficiency, better integrated into the country ' s national circle and the new forms of development that promote each other ' s internal circle.
More focused on capacity-building in industry.
In the first half of the first year, my province had not only a large number of newly-incentive-industrial-based investment projects destroyed land, but also hoped that more traditional preference industries would speed up the pace of digitalization, intellectualization and green industrial transformations, such as flying.
The third science-based project on the existing production line for high-pressure power grids is a priority for the production of smart grids; the new tobacco industry in the South Sea is committed to the transformation of energy, the process of building a modern factory, as well as the life-saving picture of "The New Age" ... ... around the country's major strategy and "two new times", aimed at strengthening the promotion of the preferential industry, actively developing new innovative industries, and the overall expansion of technological innovation and national production alternatives, so that the basic conditions can be met and re-emerged.
More focused on developing new socio-economic models for development.
As with its new epidemics, it has created a red-and-white economy, boosting the potential of digital economies to provide new tools for industrial change: in the first half of the year, my department ' s computer and office equipment manufacturing industry grew by 12.6 per cent, and increased by over-sale sales of retail business networks by more than 32.2 per cent, and by food business network revenue by 35.6 per cent compared to growth.
In the midst of the crisis, new agencies are being launched, actively promoting digital industrialization, industrial digitization, leading to the economic integration of digital economies and entities.
More focus on optimisation and stabilization of industrial chains supply chains.
The engineering machinery is the leading army of the South-South industry, but two thirds of the companies that are assembled outside the province still have space and potential.
The strengthening of industrial links will not only result in the continuous accumulation of capital enterprises but also in the achievement of technical disruptions in the key sectors of industry; it will also require potential development to strengthen the expansion of the link links, to promote the development of the "link" response, and to accelerate the construction of self-control and safe industrial links.
It's hard to pass, business, but the South is still a good business environment, the market's hot soil, and the recreational land.
In the case of loss caused by the return of the vaccines, the authorities found a short-term pain point in the short-term pain to achieve a life-threatening story that was not recommended for business operations, the policy was not broken, the problem was solved by night... in the case of the loss of the vaccine.
A focused research industry, the development industry, and the real-life business environment will be able to win more investors' wealth.
The front wind is on the move, but the state of the wind is on the rise, which has become the building of industrial projects under the province and has contributed to high-quality development.
During this critical period, it is important to learn well and to follow through on the important series of guidelines to criticize the spirit of self-reliance in order to address the uncertainty of its work effectively outside, to promote industrial projects, to build common heat, to build common hot water, to ensure "135" and to fully build a small-scale society.

Employment and commodity prices are generally relatively stable in terms of "heat" economies.
Economic Journal -- China Economic Network Journalist Forest Fire
In the first half of this year, in the face of the outbreak of new vaccines, my country has integrated its efforts to promote vaccine prevention and socio-economic development, and the situation of vaccine control continues to improve, and the economic stability of the situation is evident, and the overall employment and commodity prices are reflected in a balanced approach to civil relations and a warm economic performance list of China ' s economic performance.
Two months ago this year, the rate of unemployment has risen.
In particular in February, many business production activities were mainly in the state of employment, reduced business demand, delayed recruitment or cancellation, and increased urban unemployment rates.
As the situation of vaccine control improves gradually, the whole of society's production life order continues to be restored.
The Party ' s central stand-alone demand for progress is central to the overall core of its efforts, increasing macro-political strength, comprehensively strengthening employment priorities, and actively promoting the promotion of the advancement of the Penstow expansion of employment.
My country's increased policy on retirement, the creation of a "relief" policy group, the phased relief of three social insurance units, the extension of social insurance costs, the expansion of the social security burden of small enterprises' unemployment insurance returns, the benefits of industrial training policies, and the provision of respiratory benefits to business-focused groups' employment, etc.
As stable employment policies are implemented, business demand increases steadily, the employment situation gradually improves, the city's unemployment rate declines gradually, and in June, the unemployment rate is 5.7 per cent.
The Director of the Division for Population and Employment Statistics of the National Statistics Division stated that, in the second quarter, employment policies continued to be effective and that the early return to the land of employment due to the impact of vaccinations had been delayed, and that the urban participation rate in June was about 10 per cent higher than in February and close to the level of the same period last year.
Data show that the total growth in urban employment in June was more than 19 per cent more than in February, with the majority of sectors reaching pre-mortem level; the average working hours of business staff per week reached 46.8 hours, an increase of 6.6 hours than in February, and less than 0.1 hours in January.
The same is true of thousands of homes.
In the first month of this year, CPI was 5.4 per cent higher than in the first year, creating a new rise for several years.
In February, CPI was a little more than a drop, but it was still between five and five.
CPIs are relatively high, there are both pre-poverty demand factors, and there are lower rates of error during the spring season and relatively low rates.
However, the impact of new vaccines on commodity prices is particularly evident.
The impact of vaccine control, when material supply is widespread throughout the country in February, was inadequate, increased costs of transport of goods increased, as well as the acquisition of some citizens, and the price of some life-threatening necessities was clearly high.
In order to address obstacles to the prevention of vaccines to the price of goods, the relevant sector has incorporated important life-threatening materials into emergency transport security areas to ensure the transport of goods.
Under the role of a series of policy initiatives, the fruit and vegetables market provides strong guarantees.
In order to respond to the rapid rise in the price of beef this year, the central export price policy for stable prices has been followed by rapid implementation of the sector, significant improvements in the delivery of meat reserves, orderly recovery of mercury and normal production of order.
From March onwards, meat prices decreased, and food prices dropped by 10.6 per cent by 10.6 per cent in May; infant milk was reduced in June, import prices decreased and group consumption increased, and meat prices rose slightly.
The characteristics of seasonal changes in food prices are marked by an average of 3.4 per cent in the first half of the year.
The share of the previous year had a higher impact on benchmarks than on the price of the fruit and the average decrease of 13.3 per cent in the first half of the year.
The basic life of the population is guaranteed effectively and the Economic and Social Council remains stable.
As the traffic flows resume gradually, security supplies are increasing everywhere and market demand is changing.
At the beginning of March, CPI dropped from four months to 2.5 per cent from March to June, with a decrease of 4 months, compared with a decrease of 4.3 per cent from March to the overall level of commodity prices.
For the next half of the year, our country ' s prices will continue to remain at a temperature and level, with a low overall pressure, but still need to be promoted in order to restore production life.
Effective responses to food, farmland, natural disasters such as drought, strengthening market control, strong fight against droughts, and the price of opium.

As an artist, communication is very important to me.
Through my artistic work I tried to explain that humans are not naturally separated, but everything is interrelated.
About 10 years ago, I first went to South Asia, and I saw the ice.
I'm afraid.
My heart's moving fast, my head's moving, trying to figure out what this really is in front of me.
It's just a snowflower, covered in another snowflower, built once a year.
The form of ice is when they break off from the ice or break off from the ice.
Every ice mountain has its own unique characteristics.
They have a clear way of interacting with the environment around them and their circumstances.
Some of the glaciers refused to cooperate to the bottom, while others of the glaciers couldn't endure the melting of ice at once under severe storms.
When you see the ice, it's easy to think that they're all unique, they're independent, unique, more like our human beings at times.
But it doesn't really matter.
As the ice melts, I breathe into its old smell.
As the ice melts, it releases mineral-rich water, which they feed on.
I'm starting to draw these glaciers like I'm filming my grandfather's paintings, knowing that at these particular moments, there's always been ice in that way, but it won't be like that anymore.
It's not death when they're finalized; it's not an end, it's an extension of the path of immortality.
I've been filming ice, some are very young -- thousands of years old.
Some ice, over a million years.
The last picture I'd like to show to everyone is an ice-cream I painted on Kekertsusiak Island, Greenland.
It's a very difficult opportunity for everyone to actually see a snowflake.
So that's what the picture shows.
You can see a small boat on the left.
It's a 15-foot boat.
I want you to notice the shape of the ice. It's the shape on the water.
Here you see it's starting to turn, moving the little boat to the other side, a man standing there.
It's a medium-sized mountain of Greenland.
It's about 120 meters high or 40 meters high.
It's a real movie.
(Music) Like this ice mountain, they show everyone the different aspects of their personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)

On 26 June, the Deputy Director-General of the Ministry of Industry and Information of the Heinan Congregation of the People ' s Republic of Guinea-Bissau indicated that he was building a building.
On that day, direct shipments of products "with the heart of the fight against malaria" were held in the Red Sea, together with representatives of China's Coalitions and Enterprises, together with a multi-stakeholder group of GHG products, which were sold on the line for nearly 10,000 BLW and totalled approximately $38 million.
A picture of a rice product for the farm site.
It has been reported that this direct shipment activity has been carried out through the Beijing Chamber of Commerce network, fast-paced, domesticly-known retail companies such as Chembes, direct broadcasting, electronic platforms to facilitate the exchange of "enterprises and farm-farms" and, through the line, continued to distribute "Glusters" to consumers, which are expected to generate almost $528 million a year in total.
In this regard, the Prime Minister of the Béküdde Group of Limited Companies, Jeanna, considers it " very valuable": " This is an effort to increase the reputation of the bluefin tuna products, attract more consumers to know, like the non-expendable natural maize products and to stimulate the cultivation of rice. "
At present, the company has concluded a strategy agreement for production cooperation with a limited company in the bluefin tuna industry, a cooperative in the bluefin tuna sector, and together with a view to promoting long-term development of the bluefin tuna industry.
It's a sea of oil for the blue Sea.
This evening, due to the need for road safety control, farmers were stopped on their way "to follow the path" and many farmers were seriously affected by the fact that they had been deprived of their food and that their income had been severely affected.
"In the first year, farmers moved from the south to the north, from the south to the north, and from the south to the west, where they lived without a place to live.
As companies, we have the responsibility to help them."
Anna called it.
"Michael is the 'environmental detection team' and is not able to survive serious regional contamination. " The Chinese Association of Coal Products's Permanent Vice-Presidents introduced the Small River, which is an important element of the ecological chain and has an irreplaceable role to play in protecting the diversity of plants and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, the supply of maize could increase agricultural growth, especially in areas where poor conditions are widely managed.
Studies show that the yield can increase oil production by 15 per cent to approximately 30 per cent.
The presentation of bluefin tuna products is presented by the Deputy Director General of the Chinese Association for Coalition Products.
" The economic, ecological and social benefits of the maize production are far greater than the value of the dairy products themselves, the livestock industry has had great potential for human health, agricultural production, the growing prosperity and ecological protection, and there has been little knowledge of this. "
And I'm not going to be here. I'm not going to be here.
Now, however, there is a growing number of farmers who, apart from regular farming outside of year old, have been selected by many poor people who are unable to take action with a unit.
" The State has financial support, we link technical assistance to guidance, lack of knowledge and judgment on the market environment, and also need the assistance and coordination of industry associations to open the way. "
The Little River says.
"We hope that everyone will be more concerned about the future and help feed groups," Anna said, "our dairy products will also be carefully selected and controlled in accordance with national standards, guaranteeing quality and protecting consumers ' rights while helping farmers. "
The effects of continuous flooding have been re-examined since 22 July by the GHG Group of the GHG, which has been re-extended after the GHG in the region, a massive wave of changes have occurred, a total of 13 metres from the well, and an estimated 550,000 cubic metres from the water supply.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, the maritime sector has decided to exercise temporary traffic control over long-distance rocks to the coastal waters.
According to the monitoring of the weather and water sectors, from 25 days onwards, the global rain in the Middle East and the North-East regions has been resuscitated to major rain, partly of the region's rainfall, and in the area.
There will be the highest water station at 26 o'clock in the evening and the highest water is close to safe water.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, the maritime sector has decided to exercise temporary traffic control over long-range rocky rocks to the coastal waters.
After a re-examination of the City Defence and Weather, Water, Water, and Unit Emergency Talkers, the Ministry of Urban Defence Control decided to publish warning information at the IWW II level and to initiate emergency response at the IWF level.
The Ministry of Rehabilitation, the Ministry of Defence, called for a high level of attention to the water conditions, in particular longevity, drought, drought, tsunamis, tsunamis, and tsunamis, as well as for members of the community concerned, in particular long-term droughts, floods, water change, prior analysis of trials, early warning delivery, enhanced surveillance, strong determination to transfer the threat to the population of the region, timely mobilization of emergency relief teams and materials, rapid and efficient disposal of disaster (risks) and avoid the occurrence of fatalities.
The representative of the Vietnamese Embassy in Laos welcomed the participation of a representative of the Lao People's Republic, who participated in the sacrifices of the Old Vietnamese People's Association, and the representative of the Provincial Government, and of the Lao People's Army Association.
The British priesthood was held in a harsh atmosphere, and representatives of the British continued to sing praises to the British, to the success of the British and to the greater degree of solidarity.
In his address, the Ambassador was very pleased to say that this was an opportunity for both former Vietnamese and Lao peoples to share their common appreciation for the British revolution and to express their appreciation for the liberality of the free sacrifice of the two countries, and also for the good of the two peoples to remember the two countries and to work together to fight against their common enemies, to seek national independence, national unity, to build a common country development, and to consolidate relations between them.
On 23 January 1946, 74 years ago, 28 former combatants of the Old Fight Union were braved when they entered the Ponehe site.
This step-by-step attack has led to a historic victory in both countries in the early stages of the struggle for national liberation.
She stressed that the people of the two countries had always remembered that the victims of the fight against the liberation of two nations were noble, while stressing that a young group of two countries would continue to promote the old and strong tradition and contribute to the continued development of older relationships and the prosperity of both countries.
It's a long way past!
A new network in the 3,000-th international Milan-threaded amnesia.
On July 26th, Beijing, on the 26th day of the day, the International Milan International War of the Regen.
According to the Italian media statistics, the client's role in Photoana is the 3,000th International Milanese Association of Minds, and the Blue Army is also the first to launch this series of games.
Since the turnout of the League in 1929, the International Milan is the only team that has never been neglected and the only team that has never been reduced.
According to the Italian media, the international conflict between Milan and Tonania was the 3,000th in the history of the Black Army.
In the civil war in this area, three international Milani clients won the war against the United States.
This service opened twice, and Sanchez contributed one ball instead.
From the beginning, the competition entered the international millennia scene, which finally turned into a game.
On the left-hand side of the Belgian road, the Rukaku trainer broke the door.
In the 82 minutes of international Milan, such as the French strike, in the post-Muslim road crossings, the Sanchez road bag was fired by fire; it was completed twice before the end of Lukaku and was sent to the city of Brozovic to a long distance from the direction of the road, where Lukaku entered the block area after crossing Romero and was released by air at 3:0.
The international Milan client 3:0 won the hottest in Asia, and divided up to 2nd, after the fall of the multistakes, into 4 per cent of the leader Yuvintus.
Thus far, in the 3,000-threaded amnesia, over 90, international Milan won its 1489th, 834th, 677th, and 49.6 per cent.
Between them, the team went to 5038 and 3102, and the place went to 1.68.
The Blue Army has received 18 UNAMSIL troops and has never been reduced.
The unmanned aircraft was landed in Lithian territory when carrying out its mandate near the " Blue Line " of the border between Israel and Lebanon.
The statement does not mention the reason for the failure of the non-aircraft.
An Israeli media reported that this indiscriminate machine may have been damaged and collapsed.
It was reported that the Deputy Prime Minister of Israel and Minister of Defence, Guntz, had indicated on Monday when visiting the northern region of Israel, that Israel would continue to take action against Syria and Lebanon in order to ensure its security interests.
Israel ' s long-term view of Lebanon ' s God Party as a major threat to security and accused Iran of bringing weapons from the Syrian territory to the Lebanese God Party when the situation near the border was tense.
Israel has fought against the organization several times and has launched an air attack on its objectives in the Sudan.
An old-fashioned band of men playing a cuba-news network.
A large-scale fight show, which was held in Zhaolon, the pilot, the Sushi, Zhaowa, and the Lili, was held on July 16th at 7:30 a.m. in the Land of the East.
The drama described a joint sub-computer's flight to the J.P.A. (D.A.) U.S.S.A., which killed the head of the Japanese agent and shattered the Japanese army's surprise.
In accordance with the historical revision, the U.S. military files have been collected from the shells for many years.
During the Moscow Defense War, the Soviet Red Army was in favour of the Far East, at which time Japan's North-East Army considered it to be an opportunity and would like to join the army.
In order to address the risk of being subjected to hostility, the plan "Mudanura" was implemented jointly with Susu's intelligence staff.
According to this historical background, the famous drafting of the works has been condemned and has resulted in a dramatic collapse of the mind.
This time, he was the head of control and control.
In his play, he was the Chief of the Criminal Section of the Office of the River Police, a well-beinged and even a little upset by the Cuban police, and a real identity as a member of a local party.
The women's main dream with the play was the Director of the Forest Security Board, who was deeply impressed by the blessings of the Japanese Division, and there was also an enemy between Donovan and his minor relationship.
In recent years Su has tried many different types of roles, from "we are young" to "advanced aggression" on the ground, which has been highly impressed by the audience and has been confirmed by the technique.
This was the first time that Sussie and Zhao-Zong had been archived, with the establishment of Chief Tuba and the Women's Police, with views and curiosity.
In addition to the two main points, the "Victory" includes the many powerful players such as the Kwana, the Lili, the Money, the Reahan, and the Deputies, which are also part of the drama.
It's also known that the "Calculation" production is also very good, and the team is going through Zhao, Zhao, and Zhao, nearly 2,000 kilometers from the province of Ji Minin.
In order to add to the urban landscapes of the ancient North-East day, the set of American workshops was working at night, carefully on every detail of the scene and building and furnishings, ordering the performance of the medieval scene to be more efficient and with a historical sense.
The floods in the two provinces of West Yemen led to the death of 16 people -- a new network in Yemen.
News from New York City, on July 26 (Punjao-Punya, King) Sana: According to Yemen's local media on 26 July, Yemen's Dutch and Hajje Province was hit by an earthquake that killed at least 16 people during the last 48 hours.
It was reported that the floods caused by the floods in the Netherlands caused 13 deaths, and 3 deaths in the nearby Haji province were reported.
In addition, dozens of houses in the northern part of the province of the Netherlands and in the southern part of the province of Ha ' aqueducts were destroyed and some roads and farms were destroyed in different degrees.
The ongoing military conflict has resulted in a close breakdown in Yemen ' s health system.
According to statistics from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, since 2017 more than one million people have been infected by earthquakes and more than 2000 have died.
Yemen ' s medical institutions are concerned that sustained floods have resulted in renewed outbreaks of tuberculosis.
The "absolutely out" show is a dream-new world.
The film's "absolutely out" film, led by young people, is officially featured in the art of magic, as well as in the arts, as well as in the Middle East, the Middle East, and the Royal Palace.
The video told stories of the return of Vinas to the castle and the battle for dignity, showing a journey of hot-blooded nightmares.
The film "absolutely out" has been promoted by Thailand as the starting point for the rehearsal of "Tao" as the starting point for the famous King of China's dream, and the whole story is based on a change in Chinese cultural values, whether it is the determination to lay a false flag for the father during the past period of Vienna, or the subsequent efforts to restore the man in the traditional culture of China to pursue his family and dreams with the support of friends and lovers.
The "absolutely out" effect of internationalization will also be triggered by various types of audiences.
At the same time, "absolutely out" shows a great deal of the horrors of thievery beatings and training, the violent and hot blood on the scene.
In the video, a small game designer from the East Astronomy helped Vinas, who was re-enacted by the game, to return to the stage and capture the scene of the scene, combined with the new-fashioned high-tech and hot-blooded competition, also showed a small-scale and vinas look like "a different", a brother-in-law with a practical goal.
In addition, the love between Vinas and the well-being of the well-being of the well-being of the well-being of Vinas and the firm commitment of Vinas to the well-being of the well-being of the people has also increased the feeling of the king of the fall.
Four sectoral joint operations!
Initiation of the App ' s law enforcement collection of the use of personal information management in new networks

Opening of a new round of exchanges on land, with 17.5% transfer of funds from the overseas countries - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial Information Website
Economic Observer Network Journal of 26 July, U.S. Department of Land Control (60066.SH) issued "an indicative notice of the transfer of shares of the company's shares by way of public procurement arrangements".
The content of the press shows that for further-intensive national financing reforms, improvements in the structure of the capital master country, improvements in the structure of the shareholding unit, the share of the share of the share to be transferred does not exceed 17.5 per cent of the share of the share of the share of the shareholding unit (hereinafter referred to as "the property of Haiti") and the share of the share of the capital unit (the share of the capital (the capital of the capital) above (the capital of the capital) (the capital of the country) (the “the capital of the sea investment") is intended to be transferred through an open-ended agreement.
The cost of this transfer is not lower than that of the two above: the average daily value of the average price of the 30 trading days prior to the notice dated 27 July 2020; and the net asset value of each unit audited by the last one of the annual accounting companies.
At present, new strategic investors on the ground remain uncertain, and according to the public information estimates, new strategic investors are expected to receive 17.5 per cent of the amount of funds transferred to this mixed area.
It is worth noting that after the transfer of this unit, it is expected that there will be no control over the original and actual control of the unit, but more changes in the control structure may occur.
Since the establishment of the Green Control Unit, several institutional reforms have been carried out: in 1992-1997, under the rules governing marketization; in 1997-2013, the establishment of a non-performing State control unit, a unit of staff holding units; in 2013-2015, strategic investors have been introduced, formed a non-public capital transfer unit, combined with all systems that are integrated into one another; and in 2015 until now, the entire city has become a public company.
The current mix programme is similar to the GHG, and in December 2019, high-capital hemisphere is awarded a $1416.62 billion share of power-driven power generator (000651.SZ) 15 per cent of the unit, the GGG-residence small-scale spare parts, and the GHG electricity is implemented in a modern business management way such as control structures.
In Haiti, the overseas investment was a group of State-owned ventures that were fully funded by the IMO, the Head of the Green Control Unit, and the Prime Minister said that it was a good idea to promote the integrated reform of State-funded funds as required by the Central Party, to accelerate the important initiatives of a new stage of national financial finance reform, to demonstrate fully the need for a new approach to the reform of a number of corporate clothing, to support the introduction of new strategic components of the mercenaries, to further increase the level of marketization, to increase business management freedom and to speed up the reform process in full release.
Cross-pronounced travel and the national capital of the Trans-Military Road is dedicated to New York.
At 1220 hours on 25 July (the newspaper Leif) New York City, a total of 200 passengers from D771 motor vehicles arrived in the city of Manau Province, which was also designated by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism since the country's first cross-pronged motor vehicle tour since the visit of the TIR (the City) team on 14 July.
On the west side of the country, the city of Lunja, the city of the West Bank, the airport, has many views, such as the village of Zhijiang, the deep valley, and the village of Zhijiang, and over 200 seafarers will conduct a one-way tour during a two-day course.
The Deputy Director-General for International Tourism (Group) of the Borders of the Overseas Railways said that, according to the latest policy, the company had an urgent need for cross-country travel, for the first time contacting the city of Lancoon, and for the careful launch of the products "On the Sea to Langue" and "On the second day of the summer, the products were not sold for one week.
My uncle from the sea said that because of the infection this year, there's no door.
"It's been a long time in the house, seeing a group of people on the street, and soon sharing the news with a friend, who had never come to London before, and who had been looking forward to this trip."
It was understood that in September last year, the city of Lancou signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the limited companies of the International Tourism Group on the Overseas Sea, which was scheduled to launch 12 high-speed tourism in the Netherlands in one year.
Am I wearing myself?
The U.S. White Consulate has been reworked early and new in the states.
The U.S. White Corps consultant has been working in the state of Anti-Ban.
On 23 July local time, the number of cases of new lung cancer in the United States fell by 40 million, representing 30 per cent of global diseases.
Over the past few months, U.S. President Taranup has repeatedly called for the restoration of state-owned reconstruction until recently, and has been taking the initiative in the open-ended press conference, and his consultant has been more "responsive" than some governments have ever done.
On 22 December, the President-in-Office of the White House, Calian Conway, in the press release, stated that some governments had not complied with the standards of rehabilitation and had reopened places such as the bar.
Conway also noted that the previous statement regarding the President ' s " absolute power" decision to re-work in various states was misleading.
"The President is a federalist who believes that all states have the right to self-government."
She argued for Tranquo.
However, the "word" contained in the Contigence," which Tranquo said orally on 13 April.
This is the most self-sustained operation that the netizens have known as "reforming history."
Karen Conway wants to change history. She's a liar.
Trennan, governor of Michigan, said that he was an independent judge because she followed the medical guidelines and kept working.
Tran's intention is to promote rehabilitation so that he can hold meetings.
This isn't the first time that Carlian Conway got into a fight.
On 15 April, when he received Fox News, he released: "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seems to understand "19" as a version, and it's crazy by netizens: I don't know how to look at the paper!
Recently, we've seen the impact of a network attack on the business world.
Like Morgan, Jacob, the wealthiest and most expensive of these companies, has revealed their data to millions of dollars, even billions of dollars.
A few more attacks like this, the whole world economy will collapse.
Nor can public areas be happy.
From 2012 to 2014, the U.S. Personnel Management Office has been providing a very serious disclosure of data.
Security licenses and fingerprints were stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
You may also have heard that some government-funded aliens try to use data to affect the overall results of some countries.
In the last two years, together with large-scale data incidents in the Federal Parliament of Germany, together with the National Committee of the Democratic Party of the United States of America, e-mail incidents.
Network threats have affected our democratic process.
And there's a strong trend.
The more computer technology developed, the more vulnerable the means we use to protect data.
Especially a new computer technology, called a number of computers, it uses the microclays of the natural environment to significantly increase computer operating capacity.
It's powerfully able to break the many encryption systems we're using today.
So do we have no hope?
Should we start picking up electronic survival equipment for the next coming date?
I don't think so.
There's only a number of computers in the lab, and it takes a few years to get out of real use.
More importantly, there has been a lot of significant disruptions in the encryption area.
For me, it's a very exciting time in the history of security.
About 15 years ago, I realized that we were unlocking new skills that could produce quantifications that would not exist.
Using the basic laws of physics to advance the development of encryption technology, this idea has made me no longer excited.
Today, some selected companies and laboratories, including me, have advanced this technology to a practical application stage.
That's right.
We're going to use a lot against a lot.
How'd it work out?
First of all, we're going to get to know a more encrypted world.
You need an envelope, you have some important documents to send to your best friend, James Bond, lock it up, guarantee security.
Because these materials are the best secret, we're going to use a super-progress envelope.
It has a special password lock, and once it's locked, it'll convert the contents of the document into the computer's serial number.
So as soon as you put the document in, lock it, this time it's turned into the computer's number, you're sending this envelope to James.
When you haven't delivered the envelope, you call him.
Once he gets a copy of the license, enter the password, complete the document translation, completely perfect, you've successfully delivered a encryption information to James Bond.
(Laughter) An example of fun, but it describes three secrets.
Password -- we call it the key.
You can imagine it as a code.
Tell James the phone number.
We call it the secret.
It assures us that we can send the secret security to the designated location.
And the key to encryption and reconciliation documents.
We call it encryption.
By means of the key, it will convert the contents of the document into the sequence number.
It's hard to break the code without a good calculation.
The importance of the bill is that if someone gets a copy of it, opens it, opens it, has no secret, does not add a code, can't read the contents of the document.
It's just a couple of computer numbers.
Most of the security systems depend on the safe means of transporting the key to the right place.
However, rapid growth in computing capacity is at risk of many of the methods we're using.
For example, we are now applying a very wide system -- RSA.
When it was discovered in 1977, about 4 billion years ago, a 426 RSA secretary could be destroyed.
By 1994, only 17 years ago, this code was broken.
As computer efficiency increases, our need for code increases.
Now we'll always use 2048 or 4096.
As you can see, the struggle between encryption and reconciliation is under way, and wants to win against each other.
In the next 10 to 15 years, when computers arrive, they're going to break more complex mathematical laws, which are the basis of the encryption system we're using today.
In fact, the computer will turn our security castle into a close-up paper house.
We're trying to protect our castle.
In recent years, a number of research institutions have emerged, and research on how to use quantities to enhance encryption.
People's got some exciting surprises.
Do you remember three points that were encrypted?
However, progress in science and engineering has been threatened by two of them.
First of all, it's the secret.
The computer numbers are the basis for the secret.
But to this day, they're not really with each other anymore.
Now, we're creating secrets, based on the machine frequency, based on software, we call it a machine number.
There's always some, maybe not so clear rules inside.
These numbers are as low as organically, or in terms of terms, including the smaller ones, they are more easily predicted.
Recently, some of the shelters were attacked, and they were very creative.
They're taking a little time to take a look at the machine.
Network offenders use reverse engineering to produce a reverse reverse digital generator.
So once they have a lot of rates, they're predicting a shift, so they're going to make a lot of money.
The secret isn't safe either.
It's important to have a real computer digital generator for security generation.
Over the years, researchers have been trying to create a real computer digital generator.
But most of the design, whether it's not easy or fast, or it's hard to re-use.
But the world of a lot of things is really complicated.
It is very important to use this true traceability.
The device that can measure the amount of effect can be generated very quickly and continuously.
It's not possible to play the crime that just said.
A number of universities and companies from around the world are making real computer digital generators at the center of energy.
In my company, our amount of computer digital generators were born on a two-mile-long lighthouse table.
Then we cut it into a box size.
To this day, we can put it on a PCC, put it on a simple computer.
It's the fastest number generator in the world.
It's measured by the amount of energy it can produce 100 million followed-up numbers per second.
Today, it has been widely used throughout the world to enhance the security of suppliers, banks and government agencies.
But even if there's a real computer digital generator, we're also facing the second major network security threat: that's the security transmission issue.
The current key transfer technology can't be connected to a number of computers.
And in terms of the quantity solution to this problem, it's called the distribution of the quantity key, a summary of QKD, and it uses a basic feature that is a direct violation.
Look at this microchip thing, it'll change it.
I'll give you an example.
Let's think about it again, giving James Bond the code.
But this time, we don't call him, we use a lot of energy, we use this code to get this code through the usual light transmission to James.
We assume Dr. Nono wants this code.
Fortunately, Dr. Nono's trying to cut off this number of secrets will leave an electronic fingerprint, James and you can see.
The secret that's drawn like this will be gone.
And the remaining secret can provide strong protection for data.
Because this security mechanism is based on the fundamental principles of physics, the amount of computers, or any future supercomputer, it can't be broken.
I'm working with my team, along with many colleges and the defence sector, to improve this exciting technology, to develop next generation's security products.
The Internet predicts a high-time Internet presence, which is expected to have 250 to 300 million devices on the Internet by 2020.
To think that our society is functioning normally in the Internet world, it's essential for the trust of these interconnected systems.
We believe that mass technology is very important for building such confidence, and it will guarantee us that we will enjoy these wonderful innovations, that these can enrich our lives with many colors.
Thank you all.

Do 3-year-old children's playgrounds have been robbed and the school's reparations have been reimbursed?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Legal Journal Author: King's Deputy Editor: King's Deeds
The operation was interrupted, the child was reparated from school.
□ This reporter.
A three-year-old boy who was playing at a university's opera was accidentally hit by a football team's head when he was playing.
After some compensation, Mr. PVK, as a legal representative of a small text, appealed to the court to apologize to the school in the place where the operation was conducted and paid medical costs, amounting to $2 million, such as psychological damage.
Recently, the Beijing People ' s Court of the Sea in the District of Beijing found that the school had established a protection network at its operating site and had fulfilled the appropriate security obligation and had been reparated by someone who had so decided to reject the complainant ' s application.
Mr. Win claimed that during his 2019 vacation, he played small games at school and was then training for the game team.
To avoid the risks posed by this, small texts, Mr. Win and many other small friends and parents are active in the security areas designated by the game team.
But later, when the team of the game team dropped something at the time of the shooting, it caused the ball to fly over the grid to the above-mentioned security area and hit the small rear-view mirror.
Mr. Win was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment and diagnosed as an extraterrestrial.
Mr. Vin believes that facilities at school did not comply with the relevant security requirements and did not manage effectively the teams and related facilities.
The failure of the school led to the above-mentioned events and caused great suffering in small towns and also caused greater suffering to its families, and it should be legally responsible for the school.
In this regard, the school party argued that the school had already set up a protection net at the operating site and had imposed administrative provisions, training notice, notification of the need to stay away from the operating site and to remind themselves of safety, and that the prosecutor could not prove that the school "did not meet its security obligations", so he refused to pay compensation.
The Court considered that the presence of security security obligations in the management of the operation of the school to be an open place for the university of the case concerned, although such security obligations would only be required to meet the general obligations.
Schools have set up a protection net at the operating site and have fulfilled appropriate security security obligations and have been awarded medical compensation to small individuals in accordance with the above-mentioned compensation agreement, with two billion dollars of losses, such as transport costs, and have agreed on this one-time solution.
After the case, the Chief of the Small Testament again appealed for compensation to the school and, without legal basis, the Court decided to reject all appeals against the accused.
After the declaration, both parties had not appealed, and the decision had come into force.
In accordance with article 37 of my State ' s Act on Infractions, schools as administrators of public places have security obligations; in the event of damage caused by third parties, third parties are liable for violations, but not exceeding the obligations of insurgent public places.
The judge claims that, as the manager of public places, the most likely knowledge of the actual situation in the whole area is predicting the risks and damages that may occur, so it is possible to take the necessary measures to prevent or mitigate the loss and to avoid the minimum cost of damages, and that the law provides for its obligation to ensure that social activities are carried out.
In this case, the obligation to provide school-owned security is in line with its social activities, in particular the obligation to take basic security measures and to inform the public of the dangers of blindness.
In the practice of justice, it is also not necessary to impose excessive security obligations on public places administrators.
If schools have already adopted the establishment of a protection network and have fulfilled their obligations to inform them, they may find that there is no fault in school and that they should not be held responsible for the law.
In addition, the liability of third parties for violations, even if the administrators of public places such as schools do not fulfil their security obligations, is also an additional compensation for damages and may be reimbursed to third parties in accordance with the newly enacted Civil Code.
In such cases, the victim should no longer extend the scope of the claim after receiving direct compensation from the offender.
Today I want to show you how we make things in the future.
I'm sure our building and machinery will soon be able to assemble themselves, self-recover and repair.
So I'm going to show you the current situation of the manufacturing industry I'm thinking about, and then compare it with some natural systems.
So in the current manufacturing industry, we have a monumental building -- two-and-a-half-year time, 500,000 million parts, very complex, using new technologies in the fields, the soil and the bushes.
We've got moving machines that can take us into space -- five years, two hundred million pieces.
But on the other hand, if we look at the natural system, we have two million species of protein that can break into 10,000 seconds, we can copy DNA with about one hour.
It's our complexity of the natural system, but they're very effective, they're more effective than anything we've created, they're more complex than anything we can make.
They are more energy efficient.
They're a little wrong.
They'll be able to repair themselves.
There is an extremely interesting thing about the natural system.
If we can turn it into our building environment, then the way we build things will have a lot of potential.
I think the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
First of all, we need a code for all the complexities we need to build -- our building and machinery.
We need to define them as simple sequences -- basically our building's DNA.
The next part we need to prepare this part can accept this sequence and be used to break or recapture.
We need some energy to activate, so that these parts of us can break down according to the procedure.
We need some kind of miscellaneous balance to ensure that we build successfully.
So I'm going to show you some of the future projects I and my colleagues are doing to achieve this self-assessment.
The first two projects are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale reversible machines — 8 meters long and 12 meters long.
They're injecting electrical equipment, transmitter.
You need to decode the way you want to break, code it into a series of angles -- 120 degrees, 120 degrees, 0 degrees, 120 degrees, 120 degrees, -- such things; a series of angles, or shifts, can pass through this sequence by electronic means.
Each unit receives its own information -- for example 120. It rotates, checks whether it rotates and then transmits the order to its neighbours.
There are many outstanding scientists, engineers, designers working for this project.
I think this item really shows up: Is it really possible to expand?
I mean, thousands of dollars are spent on making this eight-foot machine.
Can we really expand it?
The next question is to look at mobility, or try to reorganize it.
But it's more step by step, it's trying to actually calculate.
It's basically incorporated most of the basic modules of calculation, digital logic, directly into the parts.
It's with the door.
Each door to calculate has one fourth of its body, two fourths of its input.
One of them is from the user's input, like you're building a bridge.
The other is the entry of a pre-eminent box.
Then it'll give you three-way outputs.
This means that the user will pack the bags in whatever way they want.
It's based on what it did before and on your orders.
Now it's starting to move within three-way space-- up or down.
See left, [1,1] input is equal to 0 output, indicating below.
On the right side, [0.0] the input is 1 output, indicating up.
So this real meaning is that our structure now includes the blue map we want to build.
Thus, information on what they want to build has been fully included in it.
This means we have some form of self-copying.
In this case, I call it a self-direction because your structure contains a precise blue map.
If you're wrong, you can replace a part.
All local information is included in it and tells you how to repair it.
So you've got something that can be boring, and you can read it and one of the outputs.
It is directly embedded; no external command entered.
The last project I'm going to show is the favorite link, which might be the most exciting example we've seen in the mobile self-adjustment system we've seen.
It's reversible and organized and has become a fully activated system.
It's basically the element you have in a series.
Every element is exactly the same, and they're the same.
Each line, or each element wants to turn to the right or to the left.
If you're going to fit the tie, you need to prepare for it.
To tell each unit to turn left or right.
When you move this line, it collapses into any structure you're coded for -- so, in that case, a circle, a fire, two interconnected bodies.
Basically, you can design within three-way space — or one-way, two-way — this link is fully activated.
What kind of future does this foretell for us?
I think this tells us these in our body structure, in our building and machinery, this self-adjustment, self-copying and self-rehabilitation possibilities.
There are new organizationalities in these sections.
You can get a new possibility from there.
We'll have space.
Imagine our building, the bridges, the machines, all the pieces can actually be calculated.
How amazing and estimating and disseminating the ability to calculate and design new possibilities.
It's an exciting potential.
I think these projects I've shown to you are just a small step towards the future, if we achieve these new technologies for a new self-organized world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Under the standardization of immune control, people's enthusiasm for the movement's health is high.
With the gradual release of cross-pronounced tourism operations, the tourism market will also be welcomed back.
From 21 July, the Province of Fountain resumed its tourism operation, and the first week after the opening, as a welcome to the tourist hot door, came up high.
As a tourist destination city, a few visitors arrived on the weekend.
The train station is expected to send 37 million passengers to the train and the airport is operated by students, tourists and visitors.
The tourism market was gradually back on track, and in July it ran 440 times a day, and 80 per cent of domestic flights have returned to the pre-mortem situation.
Air carriers have closed the doors to the upper sea, Beijing, Copenhagen, and the capital city, such as Western, and have taken over the post-resurrection tourist market.
At the present time, a number of cross-pronounced travel products are on the top of the road on many tourist societies, which are the main points of the team's agenda.
On the train station, the airport's high-speed air traffic rates, the units concerned at the value chain, the area where people are gathered, such as the security roads, and the promotion of the improvement of the "8-pound health code" and the sharing and interaction of health data between 31 provinces, have contributed to the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
"Can we get a new fireflies out of New York?
"Explorer 2" announced on December 24 will appear as a video of the original archive of the age.
The second continues to be a performance of praise, control and leadership for the whole new story.
It was reported that the accession of the second element of "nuclear bomb" also made it more difficult for this bomb expert to face challenges, warning of a number of surprises in it, a heartbreaking line, a massive explosion of shells, a fire-extinguished airport, and a rather devastating scene.
Three years ago, the "expert of shooting" by the former rebels captured the five-storeys of the year and won seven nominations in Hong Kong's film award, and the award was also a public-interested card.
This time, the "expert 2" is also expected to re-expect whether it can bring out a new fire to the King's band.
"Explorer 2" told a whole new story: the former bomber storm expert (Zedwaji) landed at the scene of the explosion and was listed as suspects by the police.
In order to find the truth, he had to seek the help of a good friend of the shooter expert.
The women's surveillance of the case was also included in the case as well as in the case of the ex-girlfriends of the storm.
It is still a bomb expert, but it can be difficult to see the new role of the Dwarf from the archived warning: cut off one leg and wears a belt on the other side of the rocket expert's tail and another on the other side of the command of former girlfriend Janie.
What was the relationship between the three and what was done at the Hong Kong Hotel and what were the cases, what was the professional experience of the bomb expert, and what was not surprising.
It is understood that the film's main game is the world-class landmark building in Hong Kong, along with its top-down specialization team, which has led to a real visual shock.
(Laughter)
On 26 July, the new Internet of the Russian Satellite Network reported that it was the Russian Navy Day on 26 July and that the major military events of the Navy Day were held in St. Petersburg and Kashtaad.
The President of the Russian Federation, the highest unit of the armed forces in the country, Chung-Pukin, has attended the celebration, where 15 bats and submarines have been visited.
At the local time, on 28 July 2019, St. Petersburg, Russia, held a large military event.
It was reported that Beijing was celebrating the Navy's Day to the Marines and that a number of small dogs had sailed across the river from the coast of Finland to join the Navy and were subsequently visited by troops at the main theater.
Putin stated that the Russian Navy had included the most recent arms and special equipment and that the equipment level was constantly rising.
In the Russian Navy, Beijing said: " The Russian Navy has a high-powered army, strategic submarines and multi-purpose submarines, aircraft such as the latest aircraft, special weapons and special equipment. "
On 24 June local time, Russia celebrated the victory of the War of the Defence State for the 75th anniversary of the war.
He also stated that the Russian Navy would rely on digitalization and effective means of defence to achieve a unique advantage.
It has been reported that the Russian Navy's main maritime forces celebrated military service in St. Petersburg and Kazakhstan, together with 46 battalions participating, including the "Casatonov" defense, the "Currakov " large anti-Square in the Navy, as well as large landmines, small missiles, shields and submarines.
The series was presented in a quiet manner near St. Petersburg, which was the most impressive of which was the first Russian warhead "Poltawa" in the 18th century.
In order to avoid the spread of new vaccines, only local residents and guests can enter Kashtod this year.
The last Sunday of July each year is the day of the Russian Navy.
Becky Yerey, the founder of the Becky Club, has died at the age of 86, and is in the new network.
On 26 July, the Beijing Group announced that Beijing's founding team, China's famous commander, music educator, final academic member of the Central School of Music, was conducted for the year of Professor Zhao Zhao, who was disabled from medical treatment and died at 13.55 p.m. on 26 July 2020, in Beijing, at 86 years of age.
Photo from Beijing's music team website.
Born in 1934, the Song of Sunnyakin, from a young Korean music.
In 1951, the Young People's Radio Consortium was directed by the Young People's Radio Group, and was re-examined in 1951 by the heavy music system of the Haiva East Masters, the teacher was taught by Professor Zhezman and the German commander, and the former Soviet expert, Alzamanov.
In 1958 he was taught at the Beijing Art Academy of Music, and in 1973 he was transferred to the Central Music School, which he conducted.
The year was 1983, the year of the formation of the Beijing Olympics.
Over the past thirty years, he has pursued the purpose of "love and dedication" and has conducted this group around the world and has received several prizes in the most important national competitions.
In the past, the Central Group was led by a team, the Central People's Music Team, the Eastern Music Team, the More than 30 Teams, such as the Maritime Union, and several concerts and concerts.
The works include "group training", "computer training", "computer training", "second song", "Children's Song" (sub-table) and the paper "Communication of Music", "Communication of Music" and "Communicator Law" and "Denance and Voting Language".
Do you know how many plants?
There are 250,000 species -- at least we know there are so many -- 250,000 plants.
And the flower is a problem.
It's really hard for plants to grow.
A great deal of experience and many resources are needed.
Why would it bother you so much?
Of course, the answer is, like many other things in the world, sex.
I know what you're thinking when you look at these pictures.
So important is sexual reproduction -- plants have many other ways to reproduce.
It can be used in the form of an egg; it can grow in the same sex; it can be given in the same way as the egg.
But they really need to distribute their genes together with other genes, so they can have an ecosystem.
That's how progress is made.
The way in which plants now transmit this information is through flowering.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every family should have one thing to look at.
How many plants there are, how many different types of flowers.
This is actually useful for law enforcement, etc.
It's a very low-efficiency process, and it's why we always run into our nose.
Because most of them have been abandoned, hoping to include reproductive cells in flowers, they're going to fall into another flower.
All the trees, that means all the hills, and most of the trees, spreading flowers.
But most species actually use insects to complete this process.
The insects and other species can carry flowers, move them directly to where they need to be.
Obviously, we notice the relationship between plants and plants.
It's a kind of social relationship, whether it's a bird or a bear, they're all able to get back, and usually it's a flower.
Sometimes this social relationship will lead to a remarkable adaptation -- a beautiful adaptation of the Red Cross.
Plants have been acquired, and the sky has spread flowers to other places.
The plant's advanced, where it creates a path that falls, it's probably lost.
Many plants look like other insects.
These are hundreds of flowers, very rare, so when an unknown insect falls on it, the flower turns around, carries a lot of flowers to hit the back of the plant, so it can follow the insects to other plants.
There's a kind of flower that looks like there's a common flower, and to some extent it's true; it's forced to bloom, it's flowering up, and it's taking flowers elsewhere.
There's at least 20,000 flowers -- a variety of amazing things.
They have different flowers.
They have to try and attract fans to help them complete this process.
It's called Darwin's flower, because it's been studied by Darwin, and when he saw it, he gave a remarkable prediction.
The basic thing we have to do is -- when we get to the flower -- it inserts the middle part of the mouthpiece, and then down the path knows the flowering order to get flowers.
Darwin said, look at this flower, "I guess there's something going on with it. "
There's no question about it. It's a bug.
I mean, it's usually wrapped up, but it's been extended, it looks like it.
Now you can imagine, if the flower is so valuable that the price of produce for plants is high and can attract many fans, then, as in human behavior, people may start to deceive each other.
They might say, "I have some flowers.
It's a plant.
It's a plant that likes South Africa's insects.
It's a model.
This plant is a plant before the simulation.
There's a long-distance ring that doesn't get any flowers from the liar because the liar doesn't give it any flowers, it thinks it can.
So, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Such lies spread throughout the plant kingdom.
It's a black flower: they may look like we're black, but I'm telling you, for the right species, it looks like only two very sexy.
(Laughter) When the insects arrive and stand on the ground, they will, of course, be taken to other plants, and if they look at the images that each family should have, they can actually see some pictures there, three-dimensional.
It can even make the insects feel comfortable, it looks good.
These electron-shaped micro-circuit pictures -- this is a field flower in which you can see the different parts of the structure with different colors and colors, and maybe you can see very different patterns.
It's advanced to simulate the face of metallic light seen on some of the bacteria.
You can see this face -- it's very different from the other face we've seen.
Sometimes the whole plant is like an insect, even if we look like a bug.
I mean, I think it looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.
It's a beautiful and wonderful thing.
It's a smart place.
I think it's sometimes dirty.
For suitable types of bees, it seems like another very aggressive bees, it will fly through it many times and try to get rid of it, of course, it will make it blossom.
Another thing it's doing is that this plant resembles another plant that has an animal that likes food.
But there's nothing.
So it's cheating on both levels -- it's hard to believe.
What we see is Ireland, part of the great smell.
I actually felt it before.
These flowers aren't really that necessary.
They're spreading amazing flavors, attracting any interesting insects.
This flower doesn't feel like it.
This flower actually feels very hard, and once again, it's a progress, it looks like it's a corpse.
That's why he likes it.
He flew in and helped him.
It's the White Sea. It's also called the Dead Sea.
I don't know what it tastes like to die, but this flower may feel very much like.
It's really scary.
It doesn't stop you from feeling bad.
Get in there, get in there one way.
It's a very good piece of meat, not knowing that there's no food here, but it's going to die here, but at the same time it's going to benefit, because it's broken down, it's gone, it's raining to another flower -- it's amazing.
It's a marine plant, a European Ocean, a mother of the Black Sea, in this country known as an extension plant.
This is what I did last week at Dosset.
This guy's getting hotter than the environmental temperature is about 15 degrees -- it's amazing.
And if you look at it inside, it's something like a big one, and it's drawn by heat -- it's a kind of chemical substance of the fungus, and the insects -- they're stuck under this container.
They're having sweet flavors, and then they're getting a little confused.
In the night they were covered with flowers, beneath them on top of them, and then the hard hair we saw on top turned into beads that made these flowers run away -- it's hard to believe.
If you think this is hard to believe, it's one of my favorites.
It's the spring of spring.
People from Brazil should know about this plant.
It's the most amazing thing.
It's about a mile long.
It has a capacity that I know no other plant has when it emerges -- it's the meat in the middle -- for about two days, it's caused some sort of change in taste, some like milk.
And there's no lungs, it's plant food, it's got a lot of things like green beans, to burn them at the rate of burning them, burn them, thank you, run at about a small cat's speed.
By weight, it's two times the energy of the chicken -- absolutely amazing.
It's done something unusual.
Not only will it rise to 155 degrees, 43 or 44 degrees, two days, and it will remain warm.
There's a heat exchanger to keep warm.
Why do you want to do this? I heard you ask.
Now you don't know, some insects like to share under this temperature.
They're in there. They're full of flowers.
(Laughter) The plants are full of flowers on them, let them go and feed them.
It's such a weird thing.
Now we think most of the mammals are insects, but actually in tropical areas, many species of birds and mammals are also being pollinated.
Many of the warm flowers are red, which is because they are red and they look like us, we think it's very good to see red.
But if you look at the light, the bird and us, we see red, green and blue, we see this light.
The insects see green, blue and green lines, they can see all the dark outer lines.
There are some colors behind here.
"If we can see those colors," I heard you ask.
Yeah, we can see.
So what do you see?
Last week I took pictures of these desert resorts, half-day flowering in Dosset.
As we have seen, these are tiny flowers, all over the place.
It looks like it's under the light.
That's what it looks like if it's off the red.
Most monkeys don't feel red.
And then I put the outer ring on my head at a certain rate of time, and then I got this photo.
It's like a really weird heart.
Now we don't know what the bear sees at all, when I call it red, you know what I see.
We don't know what happened, whether it's insects or other humans' brains.
But it looks like it's probably that way.
It's another little flower -- located between different extraterrestrial frequency zones, different clusters to match different transmitters.
It looks like it's probably like that.
To prevent you from thinking that all the blue flowers have this feature -- there's no harm in the painting process; just put it on three feet, and don't come down -- under the green light, look at this.
This could be the basis for the defense, because it works by absorbing radiation.
So maybe some of these chemicals are useful.
Finally, it's a night of smoke that Bjorn Rosslett sent to me from Norway -- a wonderful way of hiding.
I like this way of hiding.
I think it's very clever.
That's the main use of this kind of spell.
Of course, the Golden Star is a God of love and fertility. It's a flowering word.
Just as flowers have spent so much energy trying to attract predators to their invitation, they don't know why they have successfully convinced us that they contain rich inside us when we were born and born, especially when we were married, when you think about it, at this moment genetic material moved from one body to another.
Thank you very much.

On 26 July, the new Central Network reconvened electricity (Purity Newspaper) on 26 July, the Commission for Urban Development and Reform reported that the city had been robbed of 4404 people as a whole, representing 42.54 per cent of the population concerned.
This year, 53-year-old Levinian countries receive an interview from new netizens, who said that they were fishing in the Lung River, and when they were 11 years old, they were fishing with their father, fishing on a small boat, crossing the Red Sea, climbing back to the coast, and down to Long Beach. Each time they leave home, they spend about ten and a half months trying to keep their family alive by fishing.
Since 1997, however, as the rural population has increased in urban areas, the population of high-security cities has increased and environmental pollution has increased.
The Lung River border built paper factories, factories, plantations, and contaminated water.
By 2007, the Lung River had become a wastewater mine.
"All the fish caught are black and dark in the back."
The country said it was becoming increasingly difficult to fish after the river was contaminated.
Locally, large-scale hydropower management pollution has begun to occur, including clean, patrolling and water resources management, and so forth.
Literacy also recapitalised its people and became a member of the patrol team and maintained its water resources.
Since 1 January 2020, total prohibitions have been imposed on the urban areas of biosafety and related waters of the capital.
According to the data of the Commission on Urban Development Reform, as at present, the recapitalisation of 3403 vessels has been completed and 4643 fishing vessels have been signed, 63.3 per cent of the three-year overall mandate, 86.3 per cent.
A total of 42.54 per cent of the population was arrested by 4404 people.
Of the 4404 persons who have been arrested, 4267 persons have been employed and 96.89 per cent of the people who have been arrested.
Pension insurance guarantees cover 2691 persons, representing 61.10 per cent of the people who have been arrested.
The next step, the reconnaissance city will step in and step up specific restructuring actions to improve the use of the cross-border project cleanup, complete a new cycle into the river-distribution census and conduct appropriate restructuring operations, essentially complete the "third" task (i.e. mining, mining and mining) of small hydroelectric cleanup operations, improve the deforestation of both coastal areas, strengthen the construction of the green mine, strengthen the illicit flow of lead, and develop the results of the illegal removal of the target areas, and further enhance the prevention of the reunification of river basins.
Strengthening Israel ' s prevention response to vaccines in new networks
2020-07-26 04:56:44 Source: Daylight Journalist: King's Dream Editor: King's Dream
Strengthening Israel ' s prevention of recurrence of vaccines
The initial outbreak of the new lung epidemic is evident in Israel ' s prevention measures.
However, with the progressive understanding of prevention measures, the number of new vaccines in recent Israel has increased significantly, and the Government of Israel has taken several urgent measures to strengthen prevention of infection.
On 28 February, Israel examined the first case of new lung cancer in its territory in order to quickly close all entrance gates, to suspend the informal sector, to turn schools into online courses, to restrict public transport and non-required social activities, to block serious urban outbreaks, and to maintain joint police control initiatives.
This series of measures soon had a positive effect, and by mid-May, the new Israeli case of tuberculosis had been reduced to a number of points once a day.
As vaccines are controlled, Israel's prevention measures are fully dissociated, and since June the new vaccine has gradually increased the number of patients.
In particular after the entry into July, the spread of vaccines continued to increase rapidly.
In recent days, there have been more than 8 days of Israeli daily growth and 916 new cases have been published as of 25 July.
As at 25 July, Israel had a genuine hospitalization rate of 59745 and 448 deaths.
The Government of Israel has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen its prevention of vaccination.
On 6 July, after the serious outbreak of 30,000 cases of disease, the Government of Israel closed down health facilities, swimming pools, bars and nightclubs such as the General Assembly and issued a policy of restrictions on public transport and provided that every passenger on public transport could not exceed 20 persons.
On 17 December, the Government announced to the Government a series of new restrictive measures, including the implementation of the block city, including the end of the week, which provided for the implementation of the block city for a period of five17 hours per week and five hours per week.
During this period, the public could go out, but shops, shopping centers, entertainment shops, libraries, libraries, animal gardens, museums, museums, museums, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed and basic facilities such as supermarkets and drugstores will remain open.
At the same time, in all dates and times, more than 10 persons were prohibited from attending meetings, health facilities, workshops, restaurants and coffee shops would be closed, allowing for the provision of external services.
At the same time, the people of Israel did not pay sufficient attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and could not form a link with the Government in combating it.
After the Israeli outbreak of the epidemic, many people were on the street for street protests, which affected their own economic interests by governmental measures.
On 11 July, over a thousand people conducted demonstrations in Traviv, which were considered to have an impact on the economy.
During the evening of the 21st night, thousands of protesters gathered before the funeral of Prime Minister Nathaniya Huu of Jerusalem, protesting the promulgation of the restaurant, and the prevention measures, such as the coffee house, were not compensated accordingly.
In addition, many people have also failed to comply with the requirements of two-mile-safe social distance, and to avoid being punished by the police because of their lack of access to it, many people simply put their fingers on the floor or hang on their hands.
During the vaccination period, schools were a major disaster zone for the spread of new vaccines, and it was discovered that teachers and students in early childhood camps had not been required to pay their fees, nor had they maintained two metres of social security distance and were covered by the virus for large numbers of teachers.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the National Security Commission against Vaccination Advisory Mission, believes that Israel is heading towards a " dangerous situation" and notes that the measures taken by Israel currently are not sufficient to close all vacations, recreational places and summer schools in order to control further the spread of vaccines.
Waksman stated that Israel was lacking a comprehensive plan for anti-emergency prevention and that parliaments and government departments should reject their own interests as soon as possible and to reach agreement on anti-emergency issues and take clear steps to develop measures, including related restrictions in the various sectors.
This is Tel Aviv 25 July. This is the newspaper in Tel Aviv, King.
Ninja, a strong farmer, was unable to take advantage of her older son, and two people sat in the car, from house to house, to the university of culture.
Even though these two years' walk is impossible, 77-year-olds are looking forward to "the three-and-a-five come here and play."
This is an invisible building in the state of the original city, which is different from that of the general agricultural house. It is also a beautiful and beautiful movie, sculptures, traditional beads, beads, and so forth.
The Lord of the House called it "The Garden." It was a tree.
More than 10 years ago, he began to design a cultural university.
The cultural life of the villagers has become rich.
Newspapers haven't even gone to the university, and the song has been broadcast.
The choice of singing for our neighbors is that of the village village of Blyhhan.
She's been in love since she was a little girl and now there's a little rage in the area, and as long as there's time for her, she'll come to the cultural college to play for her relatives.
Recently, Brilliant also played the network directly.
Brilliant said, "There's a stage where more people see their own performances, it's a very happy thing."
On the stage, the performer's face is one eye, the dancer's voice, although he's still adorable, but he doesn't give up.
As is the case in the farmhouse, the "garden" art and non-recycling is outside of the cave.
The University has also collected several years of agricultural equipment, with more than 300 materials from traditional and handicrafts, paper, paper and film.
He was attracted by the reporters to go to the mall and showed them his old things, old wines, three-pounds, line cars, and so on.
Why does a normal farmer build a cultural university?
"The movie is my home art, and I've been learning this art since I was 15.
The Kung-kung Cultural University was established in 2012 as the first rural "non-material cultural heritage clinic" in Ninsha, also a model museum for the protection of urban non-material cultural heritage.
In addition to the University of Liquor, there are also more than 120 cultural museums in the former city and 79 civil groups, of which there are more than 50 cultural universities, such as the University of Liquor, the Royal Museum of Culture, the University of Liquor, and the University of Liquor, covering towns and streets of the former state, with over 5,000 visitors.
These peasants live in the middle of the countryside, enriching the cultural lives of the people and satisfying their spiritual needs.
"As life progresses, traditional cultures cannot be reduced. "
"The "Treaty of the War" comes back again "to count" to see the "Treaty of the Ride" attackers on the New York network.
The 40th World War I will be held in Beijing on 16 July.
"Figure" has been translated into real-time history and has been collected for years in the canals, the first Soviet military file to face.
In the drama, a popular actor with the "Catholics" played a role in the "Catholics", challenging a sensitive "Catholic" agent.
In recent years, the red-haired "faced" "aircraft" has proved to be the most powerful force in the world.
Unlike the previous war works, "recognize" the world and extend beyond the background of the story to the eastern part of the Soviet Union.
It was based on the final stage of the war on the day of the war in 1944, and described a story of the positive action of the Sudanese Far East Intelligence Agency "Mudandaura" under the leadership of the Ministry of Forests of China and the head of the Sudanese Bureau of Intelligence.
In a number of battles, the man's head as a high-level interlocutor, one of which is the wind, the intelligence, the perfect image.
But it seems that such a person is not fit to be a midwife, "I should be the one who can't find a child, if a place is such a very beautiful picture, can't all be interested in you, can't I? "There's a phrase in the wind," said the Voice, "you don't come to me, I forget I'm a national party," and I'm going to improve."
So, in the "consumption" he doesn't want to be a judge to design his master's dolls as an interesting "eating agent".
The other side of the "Victory" competition was created by the world's Prime Minister of Police, who was represented by the Japanese well-being and lily.
In the north of the south, two powerful players added a number of high-powered views to the entire drama.
The lead pilots used the word "play" to describe the play of the band and the action of the band, "that's certainly a game, and they're both special silences, and they're very shocking to me. They're often 'present', such as we just wrote half-page lengths, and I don't stop when we film them, and they can't always play."
It is not only possible to perform roles from a human perspective but also to give the audience more perspective when players are in their roles and guarantee their own personal status.
In the drama, you can also see a number of famous faces in the "Georgian Wars", three of which were joined by the "Georgian F4" in the "Georgian War."
This time, the left-hand side of the flight was replayed.
"These two people are not so generous, they're only in that time, and they're moving along in that environment."
"We're going to have a feeling, and this feeling is that people around me must be good, bad people are enemies, but we're going to develop them, and our troops are going to grow up."
The two of them were also carefully designed by the Journey Board, and he was confident that a satisfactory response would be given to the audience.
(Laughter)
Four of the students were killed by the Nemmongoam Army. Officially, the incident was called a wake-up attack on the new network.
During the 25th night of the New York Times, on 26 July, the New York City government announced that four local students were unhappy with drinking water.
On 24 July, at 15.50 p.m., the Security Council of the United States of America received a warning that there were six primary secondary schoolchildren.
After the police were arrested, the local civilian police went to the scene for the first time, rescued two students, followed by the local emergency response agency, the water services unit, and participated in the rescue.
It was reported that the rescue site had been launched together by civilian security police, police officers, fires, hospitals, and 80 others who had been sent to continue their search for water through noise detection.
The journalists learned that the local rescuer had found the first victim student on 25 July at 6.40 p.m. and that the second victim had been found at 11:30 p.m. and the third victim at 2540 p.m. and that the third victim had been identified at 12.40 p.m. and that the last victim had been found at 13.34 p.m. and that more than 4 were found dead by 120 emergency centres.
Officially, this time the flood struck a warning to the whole community.
At present, the local government-related sectors are preparing some knowledge on the prevention of floods and are hoping that the tragedy will not occur again.
On 25 July, the President of the Hong Kong Government Finance and Capital Office of Hong Kong stated that the financial market in Hong Kong remained active and functioning orderly.
He welcomed the financial stability and economy in Hong Kong.
At a web workshop organized by the Hong Kong Economic Trade Office in Toronto and the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce (Communication of Canada), 24 (Dorondo Time), it was pointed out that Hong Kong was experiencing a difficult situation because of "adjusted windfall" and new flu epidemics.
Port exchanges stable and preferable levels of assurance.
The banking system has no clear sign of financial flows, on the contrary, over $11 billion since June.
The total bank's savings have also continued to increase over the past few months, and the stock market has a series of open-source fund-raising activities and the market has risen.
It is generally said that new vaccines have brought pressure on the global economic and financial market, but the basic advantage of Hong Kong remains unchanged.
Many of the advantages of Hong Kong, including geographical, rule of law, high-speed communications, free flow of financial and financial information and simple low-tax systems, continue to be the leading international financial centre in Hong Kong.
It was pointed out that the Government of the Special Territory had reserved $600,000 million in the "Fifth Prevention of Vaccination" and had established approximately 30,000 temporary posts in public and private areas in the coming two years, covering different skills and academics.
In order to support the development of financial sciences, the Government has also launched "tillion plans" to fund local financial technology companies, creating other enterprises with financial technology-related operations to create 1,000 new positions for the recruitment of local and rich financial scientists in Hong Kong.
Looking forward to the future, let the universe express its optimism about the financial stability and economy in Hong Kong.
He encouraged Canadian enterprises to make good use of the advantages of Hong Kong and its status as the International Financial Centre, the International Centre for Assets and Riches Management and the World Trade Union for Foreign Peoples, and to develop and invest in the rural and neighbouring regions of Hong Kong.
China's immune efforts to encourage countries to learn new networks of experience
A 25-year-old newspaper, "Hungary" reported that China, as a country with a population of 14 million and a country similar to Europe or the United States, had been effectively controlled at this stage by new vaccines, without having had a wide range of spreads, and had largely controlled domestic vaccinations.
The article stated that, over a period of almost ten years, China has made considerable investment in domestic research and public health construction, which has made China's preparations for the new season more prepared for severe respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The author stated that China was prepared at the start of the SARS strike in 2002, especially when it was not possible to determine the cause of the disease.
When new vaccines were discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the strains of the virus, and on 11 January 2020 they shared genetic data with the international.
By the end of January, doctors from the mainland of China and Hong Kong had identified the virus as being asleep and warned the world of the threat of new vaccines by means of the research paper published on "Hungary".
China has also been at the top of the vaccination research and, in the state's state of emergency, through close cooperation within the country, such studies have been conducted very quickly and strictly, and the results of the early vaccination experiments developed by China were published in May and July, respectively.
China ' s experience shows that investment in the national health and research systems is essential to the effective enhancement of laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, particularly low-income and middle-income countries, are highly worthy of consideration and learning.
In addition, China's experience has proved that on a strong basis of research, there must be a strong and firm commitment to the scientific basis for correct decision-making, which has enabled new vaccines to be effectively controlled.
The article stressed the need for Governments and their leaders to respect science, to understand the value of science and to act on it in a way that is most beneficial to society.
In the early days of the attack, the National Security Commission of China sent three groups of HIV experts to the armed forces to investigate the risks and spread of new vaccines based on their recommendations of the decision of 23 January "The city of Al-Qaida"; when the experts presented the need and urgency of construction hospitals, the Government quickly made decisions and implemented quickly; while widespread participation of communities and communities also gave prompt control over vaccination.
The article concluded by stressing the need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response to global health emergencies.

The White Sea was detached from the new network in the area of the U.S.
On 26 July, according to the IMO information contained in the new IMO, the Commission of the Parties to the Autonomous Region of Mongolia had previously approved that the IMO had conducted a standing review of the serious violations of the Beijing Seabed of the OCTs.
Having been examined, the White Sea is a leading department of parties, with the idea of loss of belief and a clear violation of the principle of private ownership, against surveillance; the organization of the vision of desertification, the movement of work for other persons and the acquisition of other funds in the election of the Department; the economic collapse, the acquisition of large profits by businessmen, the right to trade in property; and the deterioration of life and the adverse effects of corruption.
The White Sea is a serious violation of political discipline, organizational discipline, clean discipline, life discipline, as a function violation and allegedly committed crime, corruption, and indiscriminately unaccompanied, unaccompanied, inhumane, inhuman and degrading terms, and should be dealt with severely.
Pursuant to the relevant provisions of the " " Monitoring Law of the People ' s Republic of China " of the People ' s Republic of China, the Special Committee of the Regions of Mongolia considered and reported approval of the Commission of the Parties to the Self-Governmental Region of Mongolia decided to grant a division of the Party to the White Sea and adjust its treatment of its enjoyments, to collect its damages resulting from violations; to transfer its prosecutions to the prosecution authorities in accordance with the law and to transfer the financial implications of the case.
At 25 p.m. local time, a small plane struck a multi-level housing building in Wessel, Northern Germany, which resulted in the death of three persons.
The Duisburg Prosecutor, the Wezner Police Service and the Wezner Fire Department jointly announced that on that night, about 1440 hours a day, two small planes were attacked on the roof of a three-person apartment building in a multi-story residential building in the town of Wezer Kompe.
On that day, it flew from the town of Mal, in the district of Rull, in the north of Norway, to the airport of Wezer, and then toppled into the building.
The identity of the deceased or a woman's home and a small plane on which it was attacked.
A two-year-old child in the house was injured and rescued.
The rest of the house was not damaged in the accident, but the situation remained unabated.
The current picture of the DeNews Society reports shows that the houses of the accident were fired once and that firemen could see the damage of the houses after the fire.
At present, the cause of the loss of aircraft is unclear.
The "Leather Post" quoted the police as saying that there was a line of evidence that the plane or the building had been dissolved before the attack.
The police indicated that several parts of the missing aircraft had been found in the scene of the accident.
The German Criminal Police, together with the Duisburg Prosecutor, jointly investigated the cause of the accident by the Federal Aviation Investigation Agency of Germany.
On that day, journalists learned from the General Consulate of China in Düsseldorf that the hotel had been contacted by the local police and the fire department, and that there was no Chinese civilian in the killings.
On 26 February, the Ministry of Health of Singapore announced that as of 12 p.m., Singapore's new new case of infectious diseases had been confirmed by 481 cases, 50369 cases had been reported and 27 cases had been reported.
Data show that in new cases of increased hospitalization, 5 of which are local community diseases, 4 of which are cases of admission, and the rest of which are foreign workers living in special accommodation.
The Ministry of Health of Singapore said that 98 per cent of new cases of disease related to known infections.
There are currently 173 new patients treated in the hospital, most of which are stable or improved and no one is in the hospital.
In addition, 4648 persons were separated from community facilities.
Among Singapore's new infectious groups, the vast majority of foreign workers are.
According to statistics, there are 220,000 foreign workers living in 43 foreign workers' specialized premises and about 100,000 foreign workers live in other types.
The Singapore Anti-Semitting Working Group had indicated that the Government of Singapore was intensifying the investigation into the most recent higher rates of infection for foreign workers.
After the completion of the tests for all special premises, the vast majority of foreign workers will be reworked, but they will still have to carry out a regular rehearsal.
The big show "Gieu's will" into the Golden Award-New York Network.
On 18 July, the twenty-third international film series above the sea was published on the official list of the Golden Awards.
The first real-time real-time film "Gijoo Likes", led to the award of the film at the top of the show, while the video was officially released at the top of the screen.
The sea news. The camera.
The video "Gieu" is the first real-time material to lead the big show, and he's a second conclusion to the Golden Award.
The video told a story: A movie led to a surprise, returned to the rurals in the North East, and wished to make a family a film last year, resulting in a series of accidents.
Family members gathered for filming completed the final meeting.
In one of the films published today, one of the family’s members — King Gingi, sitting at the center of the scene, was the background of the black land on the east bank and the prospect of the Chinese year of the harvest.
It seems that the complex and complexity of this large family relationship has emerged as a great contrast between the reds and the reds.
It was reported that, in addition to the "Third King" of Gjiu's daughter, the rest of the game was performed by real-time family leaders, video-tested videos, broken the play and real border, and brought to the audience a new visual experience.
According to a lead presentation, the creation of "Giju's will" from "a day's purpose " , the family suddenly changed as it came from a series of changes that made it necessary to change the original film plans without the final recording of life in a comic book and release the tension that prevailed over design.
How does the big show deal with this "heavenly will " and how can we continue to receive the kind of changes that have brought about this day's will?
There is no doubt that "Gieu's intention" is a full-fledged experience and that almost all-inclusive assumptions and innovative ways of listening make life a movie before its head, and under the true image package, the audience will also find a picture of himself and the family in the video as this family gathers together in a series of thoughts.
NEWS.GOV.MO: The Centre for the Coordination of New Eminence Viruses should investigate the statistics of the heatline (25 July 0800-26 July 0800)
From 25 July 2020 to 26 July, from 0800 to 0800, the search hotline for new anti-emergency vaccines should be adjusted to a total of 292 telephone calls.
With regard to 291 cases of vaccination, representatives of the relevant sector have been referred to as follows:
271 cases (including: investigation of separation; investigation of nuclear acid testing; investigation of both maps; health code; other.)
Security Police Department 17 cases (including: investigation of entry measures; investigation of entry measures for both Australian-based vehicles; investigation of the hotline of the coastal government; investigation of the retention of documents.)
1 case of the Tourism Agency (including: research on the question of hotel separation.)
Education and Youth Service 1 (which includes: search for ways to find Australian students to return to the British Library.)
1 case (including whether it is necessary to report to the Agency on the need for a report on the entry of Hong Kong fishing vessels and related matters related to the testing of nuclear oxygen.)
Bazaar's place of shelter, the rest of the camp, and a military station.
In this year's average temperatures below 10 degrees Fahrenheit [- 40 ° C], a simple room is set up on the mountain gates, the camp is not far from the country's edge, the fighters are stationed in the air every day, and they need to regularly travel to higher ground patrols on the sea.
The warriors climb up the rocky cliffs and use their hands and feet.
The value of the season is low in July, when the low-seabed area is flowering, while in Bajat al-Qaida there are only relatively narrow greens in the back of the camp.
At that point, six-year-old warriors pointed out that this was their backyard, which was only seven months old each year, and soon after all the snow was turned and snow covered.
It'll take about nine hours.
In the harsh, high-rooted environment, the warriors living here are always with snow and ice, and they have to travel regularly to higher mountain patrols on the sea.
A day ago, a patrol consisting of eight warriors, once again walked on the patrol under the leadership of the leader's lead.
Each soldier weighs about 30 pounds, and a big one goes up to the target point.
One of the combatants is on the way, and the war friends are on their way to rescue.
In addition to patrol missions, the combatants at the Bazaar are trained in tactical and physical training every day.
Over a few seconds, the sea level has increased, the ozone levels have increased, and the force has increased. These factors test the will of patrol personnel.
Their teeth are strong, they pass through several points, and they pass through a number of emergency situations.
At 1600 hours, patrols had lunchtime, which they had taken with them from their food bags, sat on the beach for over 5700 yards [5700 m], and accompanied by snow and food supplements.
The fighters at the Bazaar are trained in tactical and physical training.
During the rest, they play cards together, the transporter's gonna make a dance, both fun and exercise.
After a short rest in the snow, they set up this patrol target point and took the flag out of the mountain gates and vowed.
They're next to Mount Messy. They're just a few miles away. They're the safest guards in the country.
The Beijing Consumer Reunification Network
In accordance with the principle of "full reopening, focus planning, orderly progress, strict organization" of Beijing's activities.
On 26 July, a total of 15 million political entrants were issued, including 1 million food purchases under the line, 500 million intellectual goods, and consumers could receive APP in Kyoto.
The Deputy Director-General of the Beijing City Trade Agency, Mr. Zhanging, presented a presentation at the 25th media conference on the reopening of consumption season on the basis of the maintenance of existing consumer card preferential subsidies, which further reduces business funding.
Since August, government and business funding has now begun to be adjusted to 2:1, for example, if the original consumer has received a card to the store for 120 benefits, of which the government's subsidy is $60, the company's interest is $60; the government's subsidy is adjusted to $80, and the company's interest is $40.
During the period of consumption, three major operators will make around 5G consumption subsidies for flows and terminals, further promoting the new Beijing 5G base and 5G consumption.
Zheobo means Hong Kong's economy has been repeatedly attacked because of the epidemic, calling for a new network of time-consuming borders.
On 26 July, the Director of the Finance Division of the Hong Kong Government of New Hong Kong said on 26 July that Hong Kong was facing a new outbreak of tuberculosis in New York, where it was originally attacked by the recapitalisation of its capital and economic activities.
The Government of the Special Region once again called for the rental of large-scale small-scale enterprises and working time with retailers, food and small businesses.
A post entitled "The Way of Resurrection of the Dead" was published on the Internet on Thursday.
He said that the recent New Hampshire case had a high number of cases, the situation was serious, the impact of social life, and the economic difficulties.
In response to the epidemic, the primary concern is to make serious entry into the case and to treat and stop the spread of the virus at the earliest possible rate; economic activities should be restored when the vaccine is controlled.
He noted that, in the face of a new outbreak of TB, the former business of recovery and economic activity had been fought.
Social responsibility is equally important for the business community, in addition to the contract spirit, particularly those groups that have received substantial government subsidies in the "safety Employment Plan".
He said that the economic situation in Hong Kong was still very serious this year, but the situation seemed to slow down slightly.
On the export side, he felt that the situation outside Hong Kong was still serious.
Zhaobo said that the development process in Hong Kong over the past several decades has shown that every crisis has hidden new opportunities and every difficulty has hidden the keys to future development.
A couple of years ago, a winter morning in Johannesburg, South Africa, when I was driving to work, I found the city was flooded.
I'll drive there almost every day, but this time it's very unusual, I've never seen such a vision before.
Johnnesburg has no special inter-day ID on it, but it's almost invisible that morning.
I soon realized that what I saw was a serious shock caused by air pollution.
The beautiful environment I've known before, and the contrast between the skyline that I've known so far, I can't breathe in my heart.
I'm worried there's a possibility that the ever-changing sun will be covered with dark clouds.
At that point, I felt a strong urge to do something, but I didn't know what to do.
All I know is that I can't stand that way.
The biggest challenge is, I don't know environmental science.
I'm a computer engineer, and I'm very sure I can't rely on code to solve air pollution.
What kind of identity am I going to solve this problem?
I'm a little town town.
In the next few years, I've learned a very important lesson, and if we want to achieve a better future, we should all keep this lesson in mind.
Even if you're not an expert in some special area, your professional skills may also include ways to solve the problem in that area.
Sometimes, you have a unique perspective that can trigger a very regular thinking about the situation around you, but you need to take a big step to try.
It's the only way you can know the results.
What I knew was, if I wanted to try to change, I had to know enough about pollution first, so I made another student.
I've done some basic research, soon to understand that air pollution is the world's greatest environmental health risk.
The World Health Organization data show that in 2012, almost 14 per cent of deaths worldwide were caused by family and surrounding air pollution, particularly in low-income countries.
The mortality rate caused by air pollution every year is higher than malaria and AIDS.
In Africa, unsafe health conditions resulting from early deaths or malnutrition caused by children appear to be inexplicable before air pollution, while it also brings huge economic costs: according to economic cooperation and development organizations statistics, expenditure relating to 2013 exceeds $40 billion.
In my work, I've been looking for the results of human science, including the social relations of humans and machines, finding a useful point of existence, and helping us make better decisions.
When I think again about the issue of air pollution, how to manage air pollution, it becomes clear that we need to find a better way to make a better decision, taking into account how important it is, and co-operation is very important.
So I decided to meet some people working in this area.
I started an official dialogue with Johannesburg and other nearby cities, and I joined the local scientific community, and I also phoned people who were totally dependent.
These experiences I've been able to introduce have helped me to understand this more deeply.
And it's also helping me to avoid my people trying to update my career, and sometimes they're going to fall into the trap: quickly use a technique before they're really having problems.
I'm starting to think. What can I do to improve this situation?
I started to ask myself, how could I effectively integrate my knowledge skills in software engineering and human engineering and the professional skills of people I contacted?
I want to create a platform for air quality management in line, to reveal future pollution trends, to predict the consequences that might happen.
I'm sure my idea can be a real solution, but I also face uncertainty, and I can't guarantee it's definitely successful.
What I have is a set of specific engineering skills that I already have from my work. (Laughter) Of course, for those who have worked in the field of air pollution for years, my skills are completely new.
I gradually realized that sometimes a new perspective, a new set of skills, can happen something wonderful.
Our will and imagination is an instruction light, directing us to overcome obstacles and open up new chapters.
I have more insight into the issue of air pollution, I have found weather pollution data for the past decade, as well as weather data for Johannesburg and around.
This software can analyse history and real-time data to indicate the trends of pollution over time and space change.
We then use the new machine to learn technology in the next few days to predict future pollution.
This means that people can make better decisions about their daily schedule and where they live and where they live.
We can predict adverse incidents of pollution, define serious sources of pollution, and allow the relevant authorities to decide to adjust their operational activities.
By planning additional circumstances, how to improve infrastructure, such as housing in industrial areas, urban planners can make better decisions.
We've established a first test point for that technology, run 120 days, covered all South Africa.
Our expected results have been confirmed, and our forecast data and our field data have shown a close relevance.
Through our management, we introduced the world's leading wetlands, predicting the quality of the atmosphere, its analyticality and correct rate were unprecedented, so that I could benefit from the early winter mornings of the city I entered. Then I said to myself, "Some things are wrong, I have to do what I want."
So the focus is: what if I didn't do it in the first place?
What if I don't care about the state's environmental situation but send hope to some places, some other people take care of these things?
What I've learned from the middle is that when we all go forward in one of the things we're convinced of, it's very important to be concerned about the possibility of success and consider the consequences of not being a thing.
We should not focus on opposition and harassment, it should move us to go further.
So no matter where you are in the world, the next time you find out something interesting about your life, it's excited, and it's about what you're thinking, you have some crazy or brave ideas, even if it's not your professional area, ask yourself: Why don't you try?
Why don't you go ahead and solve the problem?
Maybe you'll be happy with the accident.
Thank you all.
(Applause)
This year's largest earthquake in the eastern Taiwan Sea
On 26 July, the New York Stock Exchange was distributed in the east of Taiwan at 20.52 p.m., at a maximum of 6.1 p.m., at 4 p.m., the largest global earthquake this year.
The media such as the ETtoday Newspapers, the Integrated Central Society, the Central Internet, reported that the earthquake was 86.5 km south of the Government of East Ireland, the eastern region of Taiwan, and 53 km deep.
The Chinese earthquake network has identified this earthquake as 5.5.
The largest quake in all of Thailand is: the 4th grade of the flowers, the 4th grade of the flowers, the Irish, the east tower, the South tower, the 3rd level of the jungle, and other markets of the area.
The Taiwan Weather Service noted that this earthquake has been the largest since this year and that there has been no such earthquake on the board border, which in the past has always been an earthquake, and has been more active since this year.
In the coming week, there are still more than four-level remnants.
Many people think that driving is one thing that only those who can see can do.
The blind want to drive a car that is so safe as to be seen as an impossible mission.
All right, I'm Dennis Hong, and we designed a car designed for the freedom and independence of the blind, and for those who have problems with vision.
Before I talk about the car used by this blind man, let me simply say that another project I've done is called the U.S. High Research Plan for Urban Challenges.
It's about making a self-contained car.
You start by pressing the key, you don't touch anything anymore, it can reach its destination completely automatically.
At the 2007 challenge, our team won $5 million, the third one to win the game.
About that time, the National Blind Association, or the Blind Association, presented challenges to the design team about who could design a vehicle that would make blind people independent of safety.
We think we're gonna try it out, 'cause we think, uh, where's this going to be?
We already have a car.
We just let the blind get in the car, it's not over, is it?
But we don't trust each other.
It's not a car that contains blind people's noise, it's a blind person's initiative to make choices and steal.
So we have to leave everything we've had to do from the beginning.
To test this crazy idea, we've designed an original car from a small sandy car to test its feasibility.
In the summer of 2009, we invited many blind young people throughout the country and gave them a chance to breathe in this car.
It's definitely a cold experience.
But the problem of this car is that its design is only to allow the blind to stay in a very limited environment, like a closed car stop -- even on a small road with red traffic.
So this success, we decided to take an important next step, to create a real car that can drive on the real road.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a relatively complex system, but let me explain, just simplify.
We have three phases.
We've got emotional phases, we've been calculating phases and non-visual interfaces.
It's obvious that there's no vision for the hunters, so the system needs to know the environment and collect data for the hunters.
That's what we're using the initial measurement component.
It measures faster, faster-- like a human ear, Nether.
I'm putting this information together with the Global Positioning System to predict the location of the vehicle.
We're also using two cameras to find out how to drive.
We're also using three radiation detectors.
Easing the atmosphere to detect obstacles -- from the front, from the back, from the back of the vehicle, and from the back, there are any obstacles on the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
After all the information from the seas was collected into the computer, the computer did two things.
First of all, one thing is to process information to understand the environment -- which are road roads, which are obstacles -- and turn it into information for drivers.
This system is also very intelligent and can be the safest road.
We can also issue instructions on how to operate vehicles.
But the problem is, how can we transfer information and instructions quickly and accurately to the blind to ensure that he can recover?
To that end, we've designed a lot of different non-visual user interface technologies.
The first three-dimensional sound system, the amplifier, the voice of the wheel, the legs, even the feet.
But today we're talking about three types of non-visual user interface technology.
The first face is called a handcuff.
It's a handcuff, and it's an engine part in the department, so you can transmit the instructions -- direction and magnitude.
Another device is called a speed striker.
This car seat-- actually, it's a moo seat.
We're putting it out, we're regrouping elements of different modes, we're sending them information about speed transfer, and there's also how to use oil doors and trucks.
Here, you can see how the computer understands the environment.
This is sensitive data, which is transmitted from sensor to computer.
So these two equipment, handcuffs and speed shocks, are very effective.
But the problem is, these are instructions.
So this isn't really freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive-- turn left, turn right, speed up, drive.
I'm calling it a vice-president problem.
So we're avoiding the command signal device, and we're more interested in the information device.
A typical example of this non-visual information interface is called a map.
Let's see this as an indicator of the blind.
It's a small desk, there's a lot of roofs on it, and it's off the inside, so it can be described as a picture.
So even if you're blind, you put your hands on it, you can feel the road and obstacles.
In fact, you can also change the frequency released in the air, which may also have temperature.
It's actually a multi-user interface.
Here, you can see left, right-hand picture heads, and how the computer analyzes and transmits this information to the map.
So, we're showing a simulation process, a blind man is using an airplane.
This process is very helpful for training the blind and quickly testing different concepts on the basis of different types of non-visual user interfaces.
That's how it works.
But this car is a model car, and it won't be on its way unless it's proved as safe as it is now.
I'm really sure this will happen.
But is it social, can they accept this exciting idea?
How do we handle insurance?
How are we going to print a photo?
There are many different obstacles behind technical challenges that we need to deal with before we really become reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to design a car of blind people.
But what's more important than this is the great value contained in the sub-products of this project.
It can be used to pass through the dark, raining sensors.
And in this new face of this kind, we can use these techniques to provide them with more safe vehicles for visible audiences.
Or for blind people, household appliances on a daily basis -- education facilities, office facilities application services.
Imagine, at the classroom, the teacher writes on the blackboard, and blind students can also use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what the teacher wrote.
It's very precious.
Today, what I'm showing everyone is just a start.
Thank you very much.

Marinicev said that changes in value were affected by lubricants and vaccines.
He said "service costs are increasing.
Because of vaccination, more time is being spent on the Internet. "
Malinichev's absence of annual internet prices would increase significantly and believe that operators could provide higher speeds and more services to compensate for the price fluctuations.
The Chinese doctor is filming the anti-Hungary Web.
In recent days, Chinese filmmakers, with respect for the anti-mung hero, led by the Director of the Bona Chamber of Commerce in winter, conducted a conversation on the production of the film of the anti-mungal film "Dictor of China".
Bona's film industry hopes to be awarded by "Cinine Doctors" to all the doctors who fight in the field of immune control, who are honored by their profuse workers!
In 2021, the film will be publicized as a national celebration of the 100th anniversary of the dedication of China's Communist Party.
Currently, the film industry is being deployed under the arrangement of the Ministry of Public and National Films Agency, and with the support of the Film Office of the Ministry of First Instance and the Film Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the organization's director of China's film director "Major" is a Chinese doctor who is a strong leader of the party, and the National People's Union is committed to the fight against new lung cancer.
The video collection of anti-Fraud vaccines will provide a human background for armed medical personnel and municipal paramedics from a human point of view, using unique symphonies and highly shocking head language, as well as a full range of sensitive stories of Chinese medical personnel who are dedicated and self-sacrifice.
It was understood that during the first time of the day of the arms embargo, Bona’s company was faced with serious difficulties, sending out the group into the path of immunization, and sharing information with hundreds of medical staff, and collecting information, which has now been visited by its own staff, including the First Deputy General of Mount Nunun State, the Broadway Support Team, and the U.S. Banking Hospital, the U.S. Army Associate and Hospital, the U.S. Central Hospital, and the former whites of the U.S. Center for Anti-Fraud War (C.C.A.), and has produced a large number of valuable first-hand video information.
In this meeting, the House of Lords of Mount Nun also offered hope and hope for films: " I hope that you will not only visit a number of experts on your head but also visit more medical personnel who are suffering from a single line, most of whom are " .
He said that he had seen "me and my grandfather" as head of China before," he thought it was good to talk about the story of Great Britain in general.
"There are now some foreign friends who still have some misunderstanding with China. "
In talking about the release of the video, Mount Nunu stated that some people outside the country are interested in politicizing the signs of politicization on the virus, and he hoped that the film could move the audience from a human perspective: " This film would be better displayed outside China than it could be in a way that everyone in the country could understand and that it was true human beings. "
In the past few years, I have had the deepest impression of the film of the 80th century, "Man to the Middle Ages," or "People to the Middle Ages", when my friends outside my country were crying, and if "Chinese doctors" could play such a role, it would be amazing."
The People's House of Commons said it would be very successful if "the Chinese Doctor" could lead to the public's common view of the country.
In the dialogue, the people of Mount Nun shared their views and recommendations on current international vaccine prevention, " I believe that people are always smarter than the virus. "
San Francisco stated that although it is difficult to predict the virus, from the original society to the present, mankind has been exposed to thousands of risks, and today's society has developed medical technology and social management measures, as well as medical personnel around the world, and even hundreds of people have a basic understanding of the scientific response to new epidemics, and people will no longer be moved "to look at the work of both sides and to examine how to strengthen cooperation around the world and to focus on the comfort of the hearts of people."

"The Red Cross" brings together the mountain -- the first Red Cross meeting -- today, the South Lake Journal of the West -- and it's online.
South Lake Journal of New Lakes Customers' Journal of the South Seas, Ninja, Correspondent.
The red boat model, the pictures of Mount Maori East, the expansion of the collection of works, the ever-changing meat... opened on July 25, 2020, the South Sea Red Tourism Culture Festival.
As one of the topical activities, the first red culture industry exhibition will be held at the regional tourist advisory centre in the mountains.
In the area of exhibitions, red wines and old-fashioned teasing products such as the Revolutionary Region have led to the purchase of tourists from all over the world.
" This Red Cross is an exhibition of the results of the national red culture industry, as well as a tour unit and business exchange experience to explore an important platform for development. "
The Director of the Committee of the First Committee of the Red Cross introduced the theme of the Red Cross, which was "The Reinforcement of Red Cultural Assistance" for a tour of almost 3,000 square metres, and set up around-the-ground construction areas and exhibition areas, as well as the area of the Red Travel Network.
Ouija board invited Ouija boards, eight foreign municipalities, including the Sushi-Sipanan, as well as 137 companies, such as my province of Sasha, Japan, Zhuang, and Zhao-Mayan, together with 768 exhibitions, including red arts, crafts, food supplies, travel routes, red training courses, red-eating products, etc.
The destruction area will be held until 29 July.
As head of the Red Cross, we're looking for a bright spot.
The head of the exhibition area reported that the exhibition was divided into a two-part red industry and a two-part red culture industry development.
There are 31 exhibitions of six companies, such as WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY, and RBD, and nearly 200 products of 27 units, such as red culture.
A number of visitors were attracted to handmade handicrafts and cutting art in the comfort zone.
The Director of the Municipal Tourism Agency for Delayen described this visit as a two-year-old best-quality red-circumvention product, 16 of which were national red-circumvention products in 2019.
At the same time, they invited national-level non-material cultural heritage protection projects " Ansecut paper", "Northern People's Song" and the provincial-level non-resident project promote special products, and take advantage of this opportunity to interact with other community-based enterprises and promote cross-regional cooperation.
New Japan has more than 30,000 cases of infectious diseases on the New York Web.
According to statistics, 26 Tokyo has added 239 new cases of infectious diseases, and more than 200 new cases of each 6-day growth have been reported to be totaled by 11214.
In addition, there are 141 cases of cancer, 90 cases of cancer, and 80 cases of cancer.
In the first half of the year, the telecommunications network has grown seven times as high as the new network.
On 26 July, the new Central Network was charged with fraud by 58101 persons by national prosecutors in the first half of the year, according to information from the top of the website, with 35 per cent increase.
In particular, in terms of prevention of infectious crime, fraud is rampant, and the prosecution authorities are charged with 43.4 per cent of the total number of persons involved in the prevention of immunization.
The Supreme People ' s Prosecutor ' s Office is guided in a targeted manner, with a total of 9 cases of fraud in which 10 cases have now been published.
From the first half of the year's trial, there has been a number of names relating to fraud, up to national macro-political policies, down to hundreds of years of age, including fraud, "medical " health" fraud, " health care" fraud, " fraud in the middle of the day, " fraud in the middle of the day, " fraud in the middle of the day, " fraud in the middle of the day, " fraud in the middle of the day," "crowding in the back of the country, kidnapping in national assets, etc., "problems" are constantly presented", "new" with regard to education, medicine, employment, age, social security, marginalization, marginalization, financial credit, and many areas, not only causing economic loss to the victims, but also severely affecting social development.
In particular, some telecommunications networks break down national borders, restrictions on areas and personnel, including public, cross-border, distance, electronic payment characteristics, non-specific groups of victims, which are very dangerous.
For example, there are specialized companies that hire high-quality writing buildings, create multiple departments or offices, use legitimate network platforms to advertise, recruit, train and evaluate recruits, use business operating models, and wear "legal outer garments", which are more complex.
It is the responsibility of the prosecution body to provide timely warnings to the public and relevant sectors, in accordance with the law for the punishment and prevention of crime.
In the case of the judiciary, the Prosecutor ' s Office is committed to carrying out its responsibilities diligently, maintaining a high-pressure attitude towards fraud and promoting social governance through law enforcement initiatives, such as through the formulation of prosecutorial recommendations.
The Prosecutor ' s Office has seriously arrested, prosecuted facts of fraud, evidence, procedural and legal implications, which are based on the fact that it is legally binding and unconstitutional.
In particular, in the case of cybercrime, focusing on the central role of electronic data in real-time identification, efforts to build electronic data, verbatim evidence, and evidence link between documents.
In the case of an intrusion case conducted by the Prosecutor ' s Office in Minbo Province, the prosecution's first time was in the process of involving the prosecutor ' s office, which took place only five days from the case, and demonstrated the attitude and determination of the General Assembly to maintain stability.
In reviewing the arrest and review of the prosecution circle, focusing on the prosecution of the perpetrators of the case, correcting the arrest of 733 persons by the Public Security Agency, and correcting the disappearance of 1113 persons by the Public Security Agency.
In the first half of the year, the National Prosecutor ' s Office has issued 298 prosecutorial recommendations against fraud, promoting joint crime prevention and promoting deep-rooted governance.
For example, the communications companies found in the case, the Bank, the Inter-Agency Organization, etc. in the TT network regulation, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office in the province of Pratto, the City of the East City Prosecutor ' s Office, and the Office of Public Prosecutors in the East, urged the units concerned to strengthen control and improve mechanisms to promote the construction of effective systems.
The fourth is doing all we can to track down the damage.
The prosecution authorities are involved in the investigation of evidence, review of important elements such as prosecutions, encourage the investigating authorities to pay their contributions actively, work together with the relevant sector to track losses and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud to the population.
In the case of a case of a certain set of rentals, such as the Beijing City Prosecutor ' s Office, the case relates to 22 series of property round-up checks, where the property may have been previously disposed of by other cases, to the Court of First Instance and to the Court of First Instance's recommendation that the Court of First Instance suspend the execution of the property in question and make the best efforts to recover the property in question and recover the loss of the victims.
The prosecutor reminded everyone that there must be a high warning against fraud, that we should not expect "the sun to set on fire," or that we should not think that it is easy to believe and keep our "money bag".
The town of Winnipeg, U.S.A., had planted a tree and spread out a new network in the middle of poverty.
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: China Economic Network Author: Juvenile responsibilities editor: Juvenile
The Chinese economic netizens went to the town of Winnipeg, U.S. state.
On the hard day, the villagers were faithfully sowing in the ground, although red on their faces, but few words were sung in their mouths at any time.
In the town of Vingin, where there is a low level, sea level, enough light, a high temperature of summer, high sugar and a certain reputation in the surrounding area, but also because of a small, small amount of money, which has not been sold at all and cannot constitute the size of the industry.
The town was a poor town with a "floating ocean basin", with a local poverty rate of 25.8 per cent over the last 10 years.
During the crucial period of forced entry into the fight against poverty, changes in traditional cultivation habits, adjustments in industrial structures and increases in agricultural income are under way.
After several visits, a group of members of the Citizen Committee felt that industrial development could no longer go on its way back.
To that end, the town of Zhao introduced a mining company to modernize the production of fruit.
Vienna, Deputy Director-General for Agricultural Limited Construction, came from the city of Zhaoshi in 2015, looking at local farming conditions from 2016 to 2016.
In the beginning, Leigh was moved by the faithful movement of the land into the orchards, and the faithful women of Leigh committed the harvest in the heart of the village: "The fruits of so many years have been produced, and no one in the village has ever seen the fruit of the village. "
"The fruit of every tree is a fruit of perpetuity, and it will not grow too high. "
It is impossible for Lee to remember that this plant has adopted a new method of planting and watering the water into every fruit tree, water and fat together into the tree, and when the fruit is ripe, the trailer opens directly to the fruit field and stands up to bear fruit.
At present, the fruit base has gradually entered the breeding period, and the market has not been sold, as it was expected, but has been loved by urban consumers such as Beijing, the Far East and the Far East.
The growing fruit industry has made new changes in Leigh's life, although still on the ground, income has become a new source of income.
Leigh's loyal men transferred more than nine land flows to the fertile ground, and each year, in addition to the low land flow, there was a share of the benefit, and their spouses were usually working in the base, "each can earn $80 a day and they can work every year".
Leigh told reporters that last year's profit was over $2800, plus land transfer and income from work income for his wife and more than $80,000, "the day of health is over."
"It has now been effective for over $15 million, about 10 times as many as one. "
There are only 6,000 tons of fruit in the Central Sea villages, covering 4056 houses and 177 million people, including 656 homes of Carica poverty, 2952 people, and more than $6 million a year for the distribution of wages.
Leigh, who was encouraged every day by the box, also began to realize his "will."
This year's agricultural holiday, Lee bought a more wild car, such as today's driving down the car, "there are ten more land in the house, the next step to the growth of the fruit base, and the whole stream to them, and the income is increasing."
Economic Journal -- China's economic netizens, chumps, cows, new king.
The new network in the "Effectives" section of the detached technology.
Deployed technical assistance to break the "heat effect"
New type of mixed basic equipment technology index
This report, The Journal of the Journal of the United Nations High Commissioner for Climate Change and Bioenergy, has made significant progress in developing a new combination of raw materials and in improving carbon capture capacity.
The results have been published as an international periodic article on greenhouse gases: science and technology.
The "green effect" is a major environmental problem for human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the cause of "green effect".
How effective capture and use of carbon dioxide is the focus of scientists ' attention.
"Separation Act" is a new emerging carbon capture technology which, with the help of lead materials, separates carbon dioxide from efficient gases and operates a simple feature.
How to make the material "inhalation deep breath" more efficient than the gas separation factor is the problem of carbon dioxide capture using the depletion law.
The Scientific Group of the University of Petroleum explores the impact of different pesticides on greenhouse gas segregation through re-examination.
The results of the study showed that N-M-M-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C
With such new technology equipment, the combination of the basics, carbon dioxide segregation, can approach the theoretical delimitation of present-day material.
" The new technology has provided new ways to obtain carbon dioxide from depletion law. "
" We hope that such technology can provide strong support for future combustion plants and manufacturers to deal with greenhouse gases and play a significant role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions. "
Before it's done, we'll find out what professional differences are in the new network.
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Reinforced Newspapers: in responsibilities editor: in
Before you do it, you'll find out what the professional level is.
Each year, students or parents who do not know the names of those involved in the voluntary declaration are required to make their voluntary contributions.
This year, Beijing University of Transport, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing e-mail, Beijing University, Beijing University, Beijing University, Beijing University of 5th University of Business, released a 2020-year-old reception policy to eliminate professional misconduct.
What does the level of professionalism mean, and what is the significance of voluntary submission?
Three methods of professional distribution
The expert recalled that prior to the voluntary publication, there must be a detailed reading of the "Inventory of Heart Schools", understanding the rules for the acquisition of higher education, including the percentage of admissions, professional distribution rules, etc.
The rules of professional distribution, after high-school storage, are mainly professional priorities, a number of priorities, and three different methods of professionalization.
The way high school is specifically used will be clear in the "Constitution Charter".
However, there are also some principles of higher education that are a general priority and there is no discrepancy between professionals.
In other words, it would be considered in accordance with the overall order of the acquisition, when the number did not reach the first professional voluntary acquisition line, to see whether the second professional voluntary acquisition line had been reached, until the last professional will had been obtained and the number had not been established between the various professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional failure" is one or several sub-values published under the Recital to determine the recruitment of different professional volunteers, which is "professional failure".
It is also the difference between the first professional will and non-primary will of the school, and the difference between the level of the professional will, such as 3 minutes, 2 minutes and 1 minutes.
For example.
The assumption that students were given a high level of A and 560 and their professional will was taken into account separately: computers, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, electronic commerce, A higher level of professionalization, and a 2-minute difference of 1-minute and 1-minute.
In the course of professional distribution, if the first professional will be informed of the requirements for professional acquisition and the planned balance of professional acquisitions, the latter will be taken into the "computer" profession; if the computer is not acquired, its share will be reduced by 2 minutes, according to the outcome of 558 per cent of the first professional voluntary review of "International trade"; if the number is still not met, the third professional will be automatically withdrawn; if the latter is not met, the second will be reduced by 1 per cent (556) and the second would not be reduced if the profession is still unable to meet its professional will.
Different levels of vocational disparity at different universities
With the universality of the same will, many high schools have now eliminated professional ills, but some of them have retained this method this year, which is seen from the "Inventory of Recruitment" published by the schools, with more than 20 universities established professional ills this year.
For example, the University of Qiao Agricultural University, the University of San Francisco, the University of Medicines in the Black Sea, the University of Xiao, the University of Apology, the University of Medicines, the University of North-East Energy, the University of the United States of America, the University of Medicines, the University of South China, the University of Industry, the University of Ninsha, the University of Sana, the University of Eastern Business, the Institute of Civil Aviation, the University of China.
In these high schools, the level of vocational training is different from that of each university.
Some high-level schools are located at different levels in each profession, such as the University of Ninsha, where the case has been submitted to the school's examiner, and according to the order of the examiner's will to be completed by one minute after a series of series.
Some universities have established different levels of professionalism among different professions.
For example, at the University of U.S. University, the total vacancy rate is 4 per cent, i.e. the first professional will is 3 per cent different from other professional wills, the other professional will is not established and the other professional will is considered to be equivalent, and the other professional will is 1 per cent.
When completing the wish, both parents and parents must carefully read the school ' s education policy and see if there is no professional discrepancy, how the different forms are, and at the same time taking full account of the number of selected schools and professions, and if the school is clearly adopted in the adoption of the differential methods in the entry statute, consider the degree between the professions and increase the number of recruitment rates.

The Director of Government Business and Economic Development in Hong Kong, New York, said on 25 July that all ECO member economies would act in harmony, combat joint vaccination, promote economic recovery and avoid unnecessary trade barriers based on the rights and obligations established by the World Trade Organization.
Zhaowa made the above statement at the meeting of the Minister for Trade, which was held on 25th meeting against new antipsychotics.
At this meeting, the Minister participated in the exchange of views on the substantive programme that could be taken to promote economic recovery in the region in response to a new outbreak of tuberculosis in ESCAP.
Zhaowa stated that the public health and economic crisis, which was triggered by this epidemic, had a far-reaching impact on society and the economy.
