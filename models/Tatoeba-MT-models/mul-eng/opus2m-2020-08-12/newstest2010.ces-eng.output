Barack Obama will be awarded as the fourth US president of Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Norway for 26 hours to take over the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth American President in history.
Diploma, medals and check for $1.4 million will also be provided for exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House will arrive at the Norse Metro in the morning with Michelle's wife and she will have a hard time.
Firstly, it is invited to the Nobel Institute, where it first meets with five members of the committee elected in October from 172 people and 33 organisations.
The presidential couple then has a scheduled meeting with Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
The next morning, the visit will highlight the festival ceremony at which Obama will carry out a prestigious evaluation.
He'll get it as a fourth president of the United States, but firstly, he'll get the price directly in the office.
The White House had already announced that Obama would talk about the Afghan war at the time of the reassessment.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that it is changing the price as a president who is currently fighting in two countries.
A few days ago, he increased his efforts by sending another unit to Afghanistan, not forgetting to highlight any of its critics.
At Obama's ceremony, he will also receive gold medals, diplomas and check for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
You're willing to put on charity, but you haven't decided on a particular charity yet.
The president will then take the floor to the bank, where there will be also the Prime Minister and 250 other guests invited.
From the start to the end, both of them put themselves at a standstill.
He said, for example, that he feels he doesn't deserve it.
He also sometimes argued that it was not only for him but for all who insist on the same values as him.
Right after the announcement, he said he's "increasing into action."
Protection of the nature of the accused of excavating
The Lithuanian police accused the President of the Civil Society of the Community of the Protection of the Nature of Lithuania of Explosion.
In a number of cases last year, he called for a construction operation, asked investors to withdraw money for his benefit, said Lithuanian police spokesman Alan Romová.
The chairman of the Literary Community of Nature Defenders is Lubomír Studnik.
Now he's in jail and he's been threatened with three years of imprisonment.
Brnu's third-party containers are too cheap
In Prague ordinary people can cross the river from drinking, and on the South Morovian districts you meet the third-party containers at each step.
And in Brn?
There you'll win a few minutes before you find the right pen.
I don't want to say he wouldn't even run away in Brne.
But it comes to me that because we are the second largest city in the Republic, they are not interested enough about this problem.
The Brno is in the spring lake of waste classing not only because we can still store paper, glass and plastic in third-party containers, but especially by the number of wastes.
Have you ever tried in the center, for example, to throw PET lashes into the collection basket?
It's a ready bite, mainly wants time and strong nerves.
The only place I've ever visited is in the Moravian village against Potrefen Huse.
Don't let Mr. Onder and his colleagues get mad at me, but I'm gonna get a little bit of a shit.
Not to mention that in other parts of the world, there is no cure for any sort of waste.
The order of my friends is not so much better.
From the lens.
They've got it all far away.
I don't care.
I offered myself after the celebration to take out some glass and plastic bottles.
I just didn't see any colorlights on Kounic Street.
Luckily I found my way to the side of the street.
However, his losses were over.
After all, it's still the center of Brna, which probably represents the city most, right?!
So the ecology and some aesthetics are probably not very interesting for brnian socialists.
This city is more likely to buy hockey extraliquids that will make us sad over the entire republic than buy a few containers in addition and offer other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I've been able to confirm my opinion after a while on the Internet with official statistics.
According to ECO-COM company data, Brno is the largest in the whole of the country of South Moravia.
Paroubkov's budget has taken money on pensions and incapacitated
After adding the left to the government's views on farmers or officials, there must be no money in the budget for pensions, incapacity or construction.
But also at the level of State debt or international court disputes.
This will result in problems for those who will rule in the second half of the next year, says finance minister Edward Janot.
When social democracies and communism were offered to some groups, they relied on sensitive expenditure, income or incapacitated government to further borrow. "It's just to put problems in the future, to store mines," Janato says.
From the money you've borrowed, you pay as much as you can and you have to come back sometime.
Too much for a choice where to take it.
If it does not reduce social doses or costs on the state's way, the tax must be lifted.
To all that left now added: teachers, teachers, farmers.
And later on, their children.
There is no fear of the pension or of the incapacitated cost of 1.8 billion dollars.
However, for the price of becoming more debt - the next year will not be lost in the balance of just 163 billion, but more.
Despite this, I am working for Minister Janoty for as long as he and I continue to work with him and the costs at the level.
The State will need money for its remuneration and will no longer be sufficient to increase DPH or reduce maternally as the government has done in its anti-deficiency package.
As a result of the money transfers in the benefits of several groups of voters the next year will also be missing five billion on the road and rail.
It is mainly about highly competitive and dissuasive tasks that are not being redesigned and, where appropriate, taken.
You're supposed to keep it, which is not free either.
This means that the delay or suspension of the thirty major buildings, which is also threatened by the cutting of European money, is protected by the spokesman of Karel Hanselka's Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD proposed that the balance of money be resolved by the Shelmounsk – the share of the ČEZ dividend which is owned by the majority and from which the transport fund contributes.
The problem is that the dividends are never certain, and they're not about a secret source anymore.
Loney added from the Czech Republic to the budget of 18 billion.
Each year, the dividend pays the liquidation of environmental damages, supplements the pension account or serves as a reserve for the fixed pension reform.
In addition, according to EU rules, this trend increases the actual budget deficit of 5.7 per cent of GDP.
However, this is not the end of the movement.
Nearly three billion were killed in the budget for various damages to the victim of communism and criminal acts or for costs incurred in court disputes, even for constructive disputes.
If it's gonna be out of this money, it's not safe.
That's a lotteries.
If we lose any international competition, we're gonna have to pay the same amount, Janot says.
The Minister will then have to save money within the resort or, in the worst case, invest in the government budget reserve.
Hundreds of millions are also missing a growing two-billion-dollar project that will allow the government to monitor what individual authorities are losing.
The first stage starts in the winter.
If the finance minister didn't find money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions would come, Janot will protect.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
Americans in the future are counting with a mobile phone on which the user will switch between different operating systems by pressing the only button.
Dedicated plans seem promising.
Just press one key and move from Windows Mobile to Android within a few seconds.
This option is intended for the U.S. company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of computer virtualisation software.
We'll get you two user profiles on your mobile phone right away.
You can switch between them, you can split them into household and work.
Both will work at the same time as Sirinivas Krishnamurti from VMware company in a computerworld magazine conversation.
He was presented in November of the year and was first introduced a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is no fix.
VMware has already successfully presented a test sample of smartphones with two operating systems.
It was managed by Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB size, which, according to them, ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
The VMware company is currently working with European and American operators to test the virtualisation of smartphones and equipment should be delivered to customers during 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains of the hotel
The whole set doesn't just care about the Krones.
Lack of snow also reflects people from ordering luxury accommodation in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in the Krkonoše there are still open rooms on all winter terms, including Vánoc and Silvestra.
We've got a lot of visitors on our pages.
People are making offers, finding out the prices, but they're still afraid to order.
And if they call us, they will immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be snow or blue," said the driver of the Information Portal Spindle.
Anyone who wants to stay in Špindler's Mlyne exactly according to his own idea should no longer take care of the order.
Whoever gives priority to slowing down the money and the quality of the accommodation is there until the second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
Spindler's hotels are currently offering mostly weekly accommodation in Silvestra.
I think they'll try to marry them for a while, but then they'll let them go for a short time.
And then free rooms will be killed quickly," Jandura thought.
The free bed in all winter terms is still offered by the Entours top travel office.
Now we're most interested in the holiday week that has not yet been sold.
Still half the place in our offer remains free.
That's why we've already had some more cheap evening stays recently," said Ingtoursu director Petr Schiefert.
Silvestra in Krkonoše can still offer a higher travel office, but less free places are available.
It is also good to travel for the first fourteen days in the summer, the remaining winters are sold on average.
This year's interest in winter stay has a negative impact on the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonos.
People are waiting for them to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the mountains without snow.
If they'll be frozen during the week, they'll be sold on Christmas," Schiefert said.
On the other hand, something better than the wool can be found in the rooms of the Hotel Horizon in Peci under Snow.
We're about five percent better on this.
We've got our last few places on Silvestra and on Christmas.
A great interest is about Polish holidays in the winter and is well-selling," said the director of the best hotel in the world Karel Rada.
Of the 80 percent, the hotel Omnia is also located in the central park of Janský Lázní.
On the other hand, on Christmas stay in the latest Janskolazen hotel half the beds available.
We were pleased this year to be surprised by the ice that we have at this time is about 60 percent.
It's a little worse than it's yet, but as soon as the snow strikes, the interest in living in Krkonoše is certainly even greater, the director of the hotel Omnia Erik Sparysch.
However, on a larger snowy scale, the crunch of the hotel must be allowed to taste.
It's supposed to be cool on Thursday if there's any hits, so on the mountains, they should be snowy.
But then he's to come back to the hospital, informing Jiří Jacubski of the Czech hydrometerological station.
USA: Packing is a mother of wisdom
It's only a comic book with which the school effort of Barack Obama, the most intelligent president, repeats in the Afghan question of his predecessor's strategy, which he himself has entrusted to the most foolish.
When he finally rejected his eagerly anticipated Afghan doctrine, it became evident that he had described it through a copy of the Iraqi script from Bush three years ago.
Not only does he use the word "as in Iraq" in his own text several times, but he did not even use the name Bush's declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New road ahead".
In addition, three years ago he himself criticised Bush's idea to send pure military forces to Iraq in the aftermath of a civil war as "unresponsive and in its consequences of a catastrophic decision".
However, the following months have shown that the Bush strategy, which comes from the recommendation of the full leaders, was the only possible and successful way that today's reports do not speak about Iraq at all.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, but he deliberately abandoned his approach much more thankfully than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama is hoping for a miracle.
In order to increase the military contingent, he was again called upon by full leaders, especially by the Chief of Afghan Operations General Stanley McCristal, who, despite his subordinarily subordinated habit, strongly criticised the White House's warhead.
He asked for 40 thousand men so that he could break the situation better.
The president was in trouble for three months, but he didn't get any better, and at least he wiped out the general of 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he was able to look forward to five thousand more, even though he originally calculated at least 10.
The biggest problem for the entire Obama strategy seems to be his intention to start the deployment of an army from Afghanistan for 18 months and end this process for three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than answers.
Many doubt that half the increase produces the same fruit as the process in Iraq.
Despite the brutal wars of the past few years, the Iraqi company has been relatively well organized, and its leaders respect the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by a negative sign - no one can rely on and no agreements are reached.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces are usually prepared to change the Lord's day according to what happens to them.
Political institutions, even if formally established, will only remain a refugee village where patriot tribal relations will continue to prevail.
The assessment of the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complex due to the lack of transparency of the measures which further complicate the Pakistani and Iran's influence.
Not even the construction of "accessible state", which is a minimalistic objective of the entire operation, does not seem too real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is contaminated by its volunteerism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated and is now on the brink of an explosion.
Believe that soldiers are sent to the battlefield for the purpose of "the sudden return of home" cause the miracle done here, only the soul can really be romantic, the reality is not touched.
From a political point of view, it is the determination of the date for the withdrawal of the army to be completely irresponsible, because it will be considered by the Taliban as an unacceptable recognition of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the desire of the Europeans to participate in the fighting operations in Afghanistan is at a minimum.
European politicians are unable and unwilling to explain to their voters how the safety of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the support of Hindus.
Another factor that is able to radically address the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the strengthened sanctions on Iran are not affected, a serious problem arises before the United States, it is unlikely to try to solve the problem of military force.
The answer will need to be answered right away when, according to Obama, America is heading towards a victory from Afghanistan.
Each such solution will also mean a dramatic business in the Afghan situation.
The only thing for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years of presidential elections, and therefore there is still enough time for him to come up with another strategy if this appears to be a total failure.
The managers of Goldman Sachs banks will no longer receive rewards in cash
The high-ranking US bank's Goldman Sachs employees will not receive cash in this year's salary.
She announced that the company would respond to the strict criticism of her drug practices.
A group of 30 former managers will receive money instead of the share that will be sold as soon as possible in five years.
Actions may also be taken by managers if they are too risky.
Goldman Sachs therefore, according to the Reuters agency, is headed by the efforts to link the tax on Wall Street with long-term performance.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the wider direction to be issued by the former investment banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he added.
The Goldman Sachs Bank became the target of criticism after it paid nearly $17 billion (about 300 billion) in the first three quarters of the year.
The total increase in the company's remuneration per year according to the Reuters Agency is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today.
High rates in the banking sector have become a major political issue in a number of countries as a result of the financial crisis.
The United Kingdom in the middle announced that it would make bankers’ bonuses of more than 25,000 pounds (summary 712.000 Kč) one-time taxable.
He's preparing similar steps for France.
This year women got Nobel's price in all areas other than physics
The record of five women in Stockholm today was taken by Swedish King Carl XVI. Gustave is an annual Nobel Prize in professional categories and literature.
According to four scientists among them, the German writer of the Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among them.
Nobel's medical price was obtained by two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greeder along with their local Jack Sostak for chromosomal research.
The price for chemistry was obtained by Israel Ada Jonathan, together with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitzm, to explain the structure and functions of the fish.
The last laureate had Nobel Prize for the economy that American Elinor Ostrom and her country Oliver Williamson had obtained for economic management analyses.
The only professional category that took place this year without the holder was physics.
This price was taken today by Charles Kao scientists for research in the field of optical trains and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the discovery of a CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each evaluation carried out a diploma, Nobel medals and a certificate of financial reward.
In each category, it reaches 10 million Swedish koruna (a total of 25 million Kč).
If they are listed in each of them, I'll give them a reward.
Traditionally, the most unexpected Nobel Peace Prize has been held this afternoon in Norway's Oslo US President Barack Obama.
The one in his exhibition recognized the contradiction of his assessment, because it was at the beginning of his journey and was also at the head of the country leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In the context of its policies, however, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary to combat peace, even though the price for this is high.
Minister Janotot is considering demos, and Klaus invited him to the City.
President Václav Klaus will take over on Friday morning the finance minister Edward Janot, who is considering the government service, because he does not agree with the state budget for the next year as the Parliamentary Council adopted it in the middle.
It is expected that the budget and perhaps Janot's service in the cabinet will be the subject of their fifth meetings.
The beginning is also critical of Klaus.
According to him, he has a very high deficit, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
He informed the President of the meeting of the speaker Radim Oqvat.
Janota wants to work with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the law on the budget that Klaus will now receive to sign, the Czech Republic should be managed with a total of 163 billion dollars.
In the middle, however, the left-wing proposals agreed on money transfers and raised money to pay public employees, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government was referring to social democracy's proposals by raising the budget deficit secretly.
Between the left and the government, Klaus and the right on the other side, there was a strong internal political dispute, which began to raise questions about the other effect of the Fischer official office, on which the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party agreed.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by the Commission, is essentially liquidated by the package of contested measures that the FISHER government has taken under the auspices of which it is obliged to suspend the State's liability.
Klaus, who can, but should not be signed by the State Budget Act, told the businessmen today that policies have long neglected "a serious problem", which is "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
He doesn't have a good solution today.
The improvement could only bring about a strong government, which could also challenge the wider consensus of political parties, the President said.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek pointed out that the budget is terrible and the government should consider other existences.
The Vice-President of ODS Petr Nechas told the CTC that the concept of an official office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and greens is no longer clearly functioning.
Prime Minister Fischer in response noted similar words for "strong outputs".
The head of the ČSSD Jirí Paroubek at Topolanka responded by saying that the terrible loss of the budget that the former Topolánk government had prepared for this year and exceeded 200 billion korunas.
In the medium term, the ČSSD has already indicated the approval of the state budget for the next year for success.
They were also peaceful people.
You played Morgan Freeman in Clinta Eastwood's newspaper.
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The uncomplicated world tells much about the country, its war and its victory despite some criticisms that the main role is to create American heroes.
The story tells about sports, racial dimensions and Nelson Mandel.
An amazing fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandel, in his life story, is an American archaeologist Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that one hundred-nine-year-old Mandela asked him if he could make it in Eastwood's movie.
Another important role in it is that Matt Damon plays.
I said to him, 'When I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
Twenty-one-year-old heres, who got the price for the role in Eastwood's play from the middle box of the Million Dollar Baby, has already created, for example, the leader of the abortion campaign for abortion, from which he eventually became a child, a real president of the United States and even a god in God's Evan, but only rarely someone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active work to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and has been president of the country for four years.
In 1993 the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded.
Invictus is a Latin word for unconquered and is the name of English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
He was talking like him.
The picture is a true story of how Nelson Mandela joined the South African Range Team Captain Francoise Pienaara to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his people are still divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He believes he can connect his people through sport, so he decides to join the band players who are part of the global dimension between the outside world.
The South African team finally arrives at the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandel's story to pay.
I had no other purpose than to play this role to bring her closer to the most real thing, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
Herec said that if he and the world's politics were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandel, to dinner with him, to be in jail before his show.
The most important thing was that he wanted Mandel's hand.
I found out that when I press your hand, I'm going to transfer your energy, and I had to feel I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to be different.
Matt Damon creates in the film Françoise Pienaara, the captain of the national football team in which white players carried.
Herec said he had six months to prepare for his role in the hardy world.
A great surprise for him was finally when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember how I called on my home phone, he opened up to me, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in his life was, 'I look much larger in the movie.'
Despite the apparent differences in the positions of heroes compared with their actual proposals under the leadership of Director Eastwood, Invictus received: Unfailing good reviews and talks about ambitions in Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summed up his evaluation with the words "It was a very good story, very good film done."
In film reviews on Rottentotoes.com, Invictus received 76% of positive evaluations.
The secret of the storm over Norway is solved: Russians tested the rocket
The special light effect of unknown origin could be observed on Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence first recognized yesterday that a multicontinental ballistic missile was being tested near the Norwegian border.
But the start was again unsuccessful and shot as a type of "Bulava", which was supposed to be originally a clandestine Russian army, gradually became a black sea of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in rocket tests had no beneficial effect on the success of pilot years.
Most Bulva didn't get hurt or hurt in the air.
In Russian newspapers it's already written about "Bulava" as "racet that doesn't fly."
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
In order of 13 he's been trying to start normally.
By the end of the year, it was back to the technical damage of the device.
Looks like he blew up the engine in the third grade of rockets.
This time, "Bulava" started with the atomic furnace Dmitry Donskiy, which flowed under the ice of the White Sea.
This type of rocket also allows an explosion from a ship that is in motion and is at the same time damaged.
Therefore, it is likely that the bright light over Norway caused by a non-flight flying object was actually damaged by "Bulava".
Last time Nors had no doubt about the Russian missile.
This time, generals defend themselves and claim they can't talk about failure.
The first two levels of rockets were still held and the accident reached the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately broken to the first level.
Although he did not have one test start without a mistake, he has only six out of thirty failed leadership of the Ministry of Defence.
Nearly 10% of the overall success is therefore complemented by optimism and it still claims that "Bulava" will once again fly without problems and that it will even enter up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum mass of 1,15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract in CSKA Moscow in 51 years
The legendary defense of Vyačeslav Fetisov is again presented in a professional hockey contest in 51 years.
The former world master, Olympic winner and holder Stanley Cup will help his team in need of CSKA Moscow and will appear in the fifth pillar of KHL against Petrohrad.
Fetis, who completed his career in the 1940s in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After what Denis Kuljaš has been injured, we need another defense.
Fetis is training regularly, and he agreed to help the team.
We just need to meet some formal qualifications, quoted by the AP agency of the Moscow club Sergey Germany.
It's still unclear whether the comeback of the famous hockeyist will be related to just one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can call the spirit of the other players.
Fetisov will become the oldest Russian professional hockeyist in the case of a return to ice.
In NHL, he played for one hundred years the entire season for Hartford's legendary attacker Gordie Howe and joined 15 heads and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Castonov - Makarov, Larion, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hoceists in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven titled the world's mystery, triumphed at Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he collected success in NHL, where he twice raised Stanley Cup's head in Detroit.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the hockey Son of Glory.
Hyundai spoke to the committees.
Hyundai's driving car agreed with the committees to cancel all the delays.
In fact, due to the frequent overdue delays, the committees announced their standstill on Monday.
He confirmed it by Hyundai Petr Vanék's speech cars.
However, the Committee wishes to agree with the committee on another annual Saturday change.
We can't give up on our production plan, it's essential, so it was set up voluntarily on Saturday, 19 December, with two changes being made, Vanék said.
Sedmicka.cz Server wrote that employees who are working on a Saturday shift offered 400 Kč bonus.
They'll get people back on Saturday, November 28.
According to Vanka, the company decided to change the way employees are motivated by the proposed restriction.
Whether they are allowed to pay the premium for a break or can choose the free of charge on December 28, and then spend the day on the holiday, Vanék said.
In addition, all employees of Saturday shifts will receive paid rides and meals.
In view of the fact that the delays were the most urgent and most noticeable point in the light of the comments and difficulties of the committee members, and of the protesting staff who had stopped production last week, Vanék stated yesterday afternoon's ruling on the immediate expiry of all the delays on the month of December.
Car workers were practically forced every day in the last week to work another two-hour shift after eight-hour shift.
After signature of the Agreement, the Committee shall adopt a standing standby procedure
Another conversation between driving a car and the committee shall take place at 5:00 a.m.
The Chief of the Committee of Petr Kuchar in the middle said that if they agreed to meet the requirements and signed a joint document, they were ready to cancel the standstill.
The situation in the car deteriorated in the middle of the last week when the number of 400 employees rose spontaneously because of the constant delays.
They also protested against the wrong pay conditions and the particulars.
The ruling stated that workers must be temporarily required to comply with the requirements for the supply of cars.
The Committees also requested that no sanctions be imposed on employees who in the past discontinued the production.
In the area of temporary temporary work, the company's committees require that the temporary work be suspended at a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay 5000 crowns this year.
Hyundai's truck now employs 2,000 people.
The serial production of the company broke out in November.
In this year's season, it has produced 80,000 vehicles, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: substance that kills and on 'indicted' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can reduce the spread of HIV in the body.
The main benefit of improved substances is that it also comes to viruses that have already been infected with immunodeficiency agents.
In some cases, this fact is borne out by the fact that the combination of the normal variant of the virus does not affect as much as some of the medicines already available.
The patient's AIDS can't be cured.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life of the combination of medicines that prevent the HIV virus from multiplying in the body.
However, their use carries out a number of side effects.
In addition to the development of so-called resistant viruses against which medicines are already ineffective, incomplete vaccination of the virus has resulted.
The work of experts from the three institutions of the Academy of Science of the Czech Republic, from VŠCHT Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance virus.
It has been shown that substances called metalocarbons affect protein responsible for the number of HIV viruses.
Metalocarbons are combined with war, water, coal and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus other than all medicines used today and can therefore be overcome by the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists come with new ‘improved’ compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of their molecular mechanism of binding to viral protein.
Metalocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi- Hostile cells made of boar, water and carbon are combined with carbon atoms, in this case cobalt.
Defective and infectious virus
HIV protease is a white HIV virus that is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV infection, adult viral parts of the virus would not occur.
When we stop HIV protease, we stop spreading the virus into the patient's body, explain scientists in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry Academy of Sciences of the CRC.
In the work published in the Scientific Journal of Medicine Chemistry, scientists describe the series of collapses in which two pairs of cells (see table) are joined by a short organic network that is still systematically modified.
Something worse, but more reliable
The effect of this series of anti-HIV protease agents has been tested in the study as well as in its solid (resistant) variants obtained from patients infected with the HIV virus.
The effect of metallocarbons on the common enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinical use of medicinal products, but its effect is not lost for resistant variants against which medicines are often not effective.
The unique mechanism of effect and their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical preparations such as metalocarbons make interesting similarities for further research aimed at the proposal of effective HIV drugs, says Paulín Résáčov, leading laboratory structural biology Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and Institute of Molecular Genetic Science.
It's hard for the budget. The ODS has left to Fischer, it's protecting itself.
The Head of ODS Mirek Topolánek noted the approved budget for the next year for "frequency" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should consider another existence.
The ODS statement was signed by the President of the Government for strong outputs.
He's got enough time for analysis.
The Vice-President of ODS Petr Nechas said that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party is no longer clearly functioning.
The President of the Government must, according to Time, decide whether he is willing to sit in the shadow on a minority which is involved in the fight against growing deficit or whether he is being held in office with the help of the Parliamentary Left.
The approach of ODS and social democracy to public deficit problems is diametrically different, warns New Time.
The mid-term budget for 2010 was adopted, together with the left-wing amendments for more than 12 billion koruna.
The tax system increased the payment of public employees, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's contribution to social democracy's proposals was by raising the budget deficit secretly.
The CPR should be managed with a discount of 163 billion dollars.
The ODS left the Chamber before the vote, expressed the government's expectation that even the revised budget would be less poor than the budget provisional.
Destructiveness and Martility
Minister of Finance Edward Janotat spoke of the collapse and the feeling of amnesty, Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government's current situation is still in line.
It is not time to believe that if Janotto had seriously threatened the withdrawal of functions in the event of the adoption of amendments, the situation might have seemed different.
According to Czech TV, Janato ordered Monday after the government to the prime minister.
I mean, he's looking at another operation.
The reason is his failure to agree on the budget.
If Fischer is referring to another battle with budget deficits, they have no time in the government to do the ČSSD nominees who have made changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will make it clear that he will give the Democrats if he approves other laws that raise an increasing deficit, such as those relating to incapacitated, income or new service law.
Topolánk: Ministers of the nominating ODS have failed
It's the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ODS nomination ministers did nothing wrong, highlighted Topolánek in a US text message.
He noted that in several ministries there are people in municipal functions voting against TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
He once pointed out that if Fischer decides to reject the principle of combating the high deficit of public finances, "it is quite logical and correct that it is contrary to the majority of the left, which is currently in decline".
But it can't be counted with the support and tolerance of civil democracies.
I didn't think about it, and when it's going to work out, I'm going to blame myself, he told reporters in the defence minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government by the right citizens of democracy.
The President-in-Office of the Council of Europe, Mr Fischer, visited Brussels this afternoon.
At the request of the ODS Prime Minister
At the same time, it was pointed out that the ODS would vote in the middle of the amended budget if the Prime Minister of the People's Democrats had not explicitly asked for the adoption of the budget.
We do not appear to be poor, we are not small children, then we have responded to the question whether ODS did not have the incompatibility of the President of Parliament and the Czech Republic at the political meeting on the budget.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
As soon as I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the months to come, in particular, there would be a deterioration of the sense of smell and destruction of all positive, Topolánek himself.
According to the new set of CDs, less trains are going for almost the same train
The Czech road since December 13 breaks down or limits some less complex speeds and locations, other links are forced on.
The total volume of transport shall be reduced by two per cent from the date of entry into force of the new railway line.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer driving, do not change.
More access to the main city, for example, is obtained by the people of Ostravska, and the roads on this route add one pendolino adjustment.
However, the emergency will stop driving to Bratislava.
Less speeds will also go on track Praha - Písek - České Budějovice, mainly limited direct connection to Praha - Letohrad.
From the regions, roads are planning the largest reduction in transport in the Kingdom Hall, eight per cent, on the contrary, can be enjoyed by Prague and the environment.
There are also two night trains on the road Praha - Tábor - České Budějovice and a few speeds on the route Praha - Písek - České Budějovice is limited to a few days a week.
The biggest change is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovic to Prague, today Milovici have to move to Lysa nad Labem.
It is about the fifteenth line of the Esko local system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electric traffic from Lysé over Labe to Milovic.
The remote connections to the main city will be completed at the Prague Main Station.
The CD will introduce several SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jesseník in two-year intervals.
The Pendoline to Bratislava is no longer connected since 13 December.
Annual accounts for regional railways: 200 million more
It orders and pays the Ministry of Transport, in full the compensation for so-called loss of evidence, for the next year, four billion crowns, as well as for the year. Locals order countries to pay for them for the next year eight billion crowns, while not all three billion countries contribute to the state.
This year there are 200 million more expensive regional trains.
On the premises and on-the-spot roads have a new ten-year contract, the contract has always been for one year.
The roads are praised by the system, so they obviously did not contribute to the increase in the price of most of the trains.
To change, only one online ČD Net and cheap eLiška Internet pages will be available.
For travellers without customer cards the price of the ČD Net increases from 450 koruna to 600 korunas.
The price of eLišky will be re-emerged from the narrow distance, so far it has been one and 160 korunas for the journey between the voluntary national cities.
The Philippines continues to hold more than 50 people, children left for freedom
Today, the armed forces in the southern Philippines sent 75 people, including several basic schools and their teachers.
This was introduced by the AFP agency, which originally reported only 65 entries.
All 17 children detained were left eight hours later, including one teacher.
They arrived in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 armed men use their hands as a living protection while running from the police.
Local contractors are now trying to agree to the release of the remaining hands.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is armed by the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP police agency, the original arrival was due to violence which required the removal of accounts between the two local family clans.
In the south of the province of Magindinanao, a recent massacre involving 57 people was declared a state-of-the-art right.
Among the victims of the massacre on 23 November was 30 journalists associated with elections to the government office.
To suspect that he was involved in the massacre, he was arrested by the governor of this southern Philippines province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan tribe.
The island of Mindanao is also a Muslim separatist.
But this morning, they renewed their peace talks with the Philippines government.
The JAR story is about everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The next day, a new Hollywood film, Clint Eastwood Invictus (formal name in Czech name Invictus: Invictus: Unavoidably), will come into the United States, which will capture part of the life story of former President Nelson Mandely of the South African Republic.
The role of a well-known warrior against apartheid was raised by Morgan Freeman, whom he was proud of for his creation years before Mandela himself.
The next male role of the legendary South African champion in the Francoise Pienaara corner was hosted by Matt Damon.
With the introduction of a picture into the cinema, critical voices and public voices
Nelson Mandela
The whole name of Nelson Rolihhal Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in the South African Union.
In 1988 he received Sachar's price for freedom of thought, then in 1993 with De Klerek Nobel's price of peace.
He was President of the South African Republic in 1994-1999.
Great expectation, as it comes to the public at a time when, in the South African Republic, there are preparations for a global football championship, however, the media are spreading disturbing reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination on the part of the people of the northern majority.
According to the AP reporting agency, advertising on a new film in JAR is always positive, despite numerous benefits from the "professional" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is, however, in line with his words on a new movie proud.
I've been dreaming about that role for a long time, and I've been well prepared for it.
Many times I also met Nelson Mandel personally so that I could, as it is said, devote his energy to the discussion after the famous film prime minister in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remind the film of Mandel's personality and his message.
It's the history of the South African Republic, but it's about every person, he added.
In the form of a national team of rubies
Photo based on the book presentation of British writer John Carlina with a freely translated name In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that enabled the nation to produce a portrait of the human rights of South Africa during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman is therefore trying to build two races and after a long year each other's group of people, and just like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he is also in the heretic role in South Africa's national football race at the world prize game that JAR won at that time.
For entry into the painting, which is understood in JAR almost as a sacred object, Mandela hid a large sheep mainly in the white public for fourteen years and obtained recognition of white citizenship.
The football skills may enable people to reunite in one nation, introduced the boxing player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the drinking situation in the JAR improves, it will be shown first.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical about how, for example, in a recent speech for LN produced a fanician of the Count Christopher Dawson who fled from the country to Britain.
The championship will begin on 11 June 2010.
In Lunsk, the transformer burns for tens of millions of crowns
The fire caught the early transformer of the company Čeps in the town of Hüškov in Lounsk.
In the fire, Lukaša Marvana employs six units according to his native language.
Initially, the firemen wanted to let the transformer burn, but later they reviewed and the fire mixed water, bread and special special special ingredients.
The reason was the technical argument, the internal collapse of the transformer.
No one was injured, according to Pauly Mandát's spokesman, the accident does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, which will be calculated exactly after the end of the fire.
The lost transformer will be replaced by a new one according to Mandato's need.
In ten years, the Czech company's actions have been nothing like this, and the findings of this type have been completed.
The supply of electricity was not influenced by ČEZ's spokesman for the northern Czech Soni Holinger Hendrich's interruptions, the operation of households, offices or the company's fire station.
A.s. Čeps acts on the territory of the Czech Republic as an independent transmission system operator, 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 solutions with 67 transformers transforming electricity from transmission to distribution system and driving route of 4339 kilometres.
Jancúra gives a criminal notice for a three-haitman talk from ČSSD
The owner Student Agency Radim Jancura gives a criminal notice for a talk on three social-democratic Heitmans.
And it's on Michel Haška from the Southmore region, Radko Martínk from the Pardubic region and the Heitman from the Olomouk region of Martin Tesarik.
Jancura introduced it in the 20th minute of the radio magazine.
The complaint relates to the company's efforts to carry out regional rail transport in some countries.
But all regions finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech Drahams.
All three Haitians attack us and talk about our choice of solutions, but we only offer what they want.
He claims we are more expensive than the Czech streets, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech streets that were closed last week.
So we don't have to defend ourselves.
It's about talking about the student agency, said the radio journal Jancura.
At the same time, he indicated that he had evidence from all countries that they had not taken their steps in accordance with European law.
It therefore prepares for the European Commission.
The scene of a criminal notice is considered to be a further media show by Mr. Janchury, who serves him as a free commercial by his company and his own persons.
I am perfectly prepared to raise the good name of my country and my country and to the same challenge as the other Haitians.
I suppose it will be clear on this occasion that it is Mr Janchur, who manipulates the public and uses false and false arguments in the matter of regional rail transport.
Jancura has already announced last week that it invests a number of millions of crowns in advertising that will alert the countries of an inadequate measure.
The radio journal said the campaign after Christmas is over and continues in it after New Year's.
He made it clear that the campaign would be held against corruption as such.
The campaign started Jancúra after the countries agreed to carry out regional rail connections with the Czech authorities and did not issue tenders for about 150 billion crowns.
According to Janchury, there is a similar anti-legislative approach and in contrast to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
As a result of the criticism of rail transport in the countries, Janchur was already threatened by the Ambassador for the ČSSD.
The only challenge was that if we don't let it go, we can get a bus license.
He introduced himself as an apostle of the ČSSD, I know what you're talking about, his name I won't tell you, said Radio Journal Janchur today.
The anti-pneumococcal treatment will be free and compulsory
The expectant anti-pneumococcals from the ice collection is the most common.
It should be like the first for families free of charge and at least not mandatory.
However, voices are already calling for a more effective expectation.
Preparations for the introduction of free-of-charge anti-pneumococcals.
The prescription already provides the maximum vaccine prices to be paid by the health insurance.
The experts are already clearly in the process of expecting it.
New expectations
Vaccines free of charge for Serbian children
From January onwards, children born on and after January can be expected free of charge against pneumococcals.
The condition is that they have not yet had a single dose of waiting.
Anyone who started to expect a loan or earlier has to pay for it himself.
The first dose of expectance must be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Loni has already voluntarily allowed her children to wait against the pneumococcals of the fourth family.
At the same time, parents paid 1600 korunas for one dose and more.
Four doses are needed when expecting the youngest children.
Total experts estimate that health insurance issues at estimated doses of 300 to 450 thousand koruna per year.
But they'll save you for the treatment that children would need without expecting.
So far, the state has given up 500 thousand a year for all flat expectations of children.
The horror was accompanied by the so-called Janot package.
The pneumococcal causes central ear infections, but also serious infections including brain proteins and blood vessels.
For the pneumococcal infection we die within a year by investigation in hospitals up to 28 children to 10 years of age.
In addition to Česka, they have led to a gruesome flat-screen look at children against pneumococcals in about 40 countries.
Will it be necessary to wait?
At the same time, however, there are views that this expectation may be binding in the future.
He's got to be threatened with insurance and non-compulsory.
To make sure it's better to wait, for example, the head of the civil society of Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský.
His combination of pneumococcal vaccines has long been promoting.
The experts at the international conference that our associations attended were not fully satisfied with our voluntary expectations.
It's not perfectly ideal.
On the other hand, we're glad that at least this has happened.
I think it's the way we're going to get in here.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the expected procedure against pneumococcals.
At this point we don't even think about it, his spokesman Vlastimil Srschenn said.
Voluntary expectation has its disadvantages, claims doctors
The President of the Committee of Practical Children's Doctors Hana Cabrnokh acknowledges that he has a voluntary estimate of his disadvantages.
If all children are expected, it could be considered to reduce the number of expectantials "Because of the situation where these vaccines are so high, we understand the political decision that this expectation has been postponed as voluntary," Cabrnoch says.
Experts are expected to allow their legs to be expected against pneumococcals from the next year more than 80 percent of clean parents.
The expectant of pneumococcals is a half-life in that it is not a state of health or health care as the first flat-rate expectance of children.
Insurance should pay for prevention, save for another treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy their own ingredients.
This, however, relates to the concerns of practical child doctors who are involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, vaccines should be purchased by insurance companies and physicians should obtain them in the same way that their state provides other substances for other expectations.
However, some Members feared that insurance could be so "to bring money out of health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy and wait until they have insurance money.
It is estimated that each child's practical doctor will invest 40 thousand a month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnoch.
American artist's son's stolen into the museum'
The son of a renowned American artist, Frank Frazetta, was accused of trying to steal pictures of 20 million dollars (12 million dollars free) from his father's museum.
The police in Pennsylvania reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been reached when 90 images were loaded into his vehicle and his luggage.
Mr Frazetta and the other man used to enter the museum in the Poconco Mountains bar.
Mr. Frazetta, 81 years old, celebrated the creation of Barbara Conana and Tarzan.
At the time this happened, the artist was found on Florida, as indicated by the Press Agency Associated Press.
The AP quoted an appointed police officer who stated that Mr Frazetta could have been motivated by long-term family disputes.
Before the police, Mr Frazetta issued a new virulent statement, 52 years of age, that he did so at his father's direction, "to get to the museum in any way possible and move images into the sweeter areas," says the agency.
Mr Frazetta, Sir, has passed on any authorization as the agency has given.
Laborists are preventing planned tax increases
The minutes drew attention to the increase in taxes and cuts in expenditure announced in the preliminary report on the budget against the criticism of opposition, businesses and committees.
As Alistair Darling pointed out, the Tory's "promulgated" option to show that they mean a serious delay in the decision to reduce deficit until after the elections.
I got the office under the deck because of the achievement of low- and medium-income workers.
According to its proposal, there is an increase of 0.5 % in social insurance and 1 % in public payments since 2011.
Differences in social insurance
The committees protested that low-income workers were under pressure for recession that they did not regret and warned against "the problems".
Social insurance is increasing - growth of around 3 billion pounds per year - which has affected the community of entrepreneurs who indicated that the employment tax should be reimbursed while the economy should be refocused.
This increase, which limits these revenues to more than 20,000 pounds per year, affects about 10 million workers.
Key Points PBR
Social insurance increases by 0.5 % since April 2011
The economic situation is higher than expected by 4.75% this year
New tax 50 % of bankers’ bonuses
1% tax on small companies for subscriptions
Reduction of taxes on motor vehicles and wind power
Increase in the level of payments by 2,5 %
According to the State Financial Administration, some 30000 allowances are reduced by 90 pounds per year and some 40000 allowances are reduced by 190 pounds, while some 10000 allowances are increased by 110 pounds.
The ministers announced that their target of reducing deficit by half by 2013 was "complicated decisions", but they insisted that 60% of special taxes should be equal to 5% of the highest income.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms said that the proposed increase in taxation and expenditure reduction would be "the ocean cap" compared to what would be needed.
"It's a large number, which will allow us to reduce the deficit by half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," BBC said.
Mr Timms pointed out that it is convinced that economic growth should take place in the past year.
But the development of projections for future economic growth - which will have an impact on the amount of needed loans and on how fast the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the office has been submitted to review previous shares.
In this opinion, the decline in the economy was 4.75% - far worse than the drop in 3.5%, predicted in depth - because loans were 3 billion more free than were previously estimated.
Promulgated opportunity'
Conservatives who launched a new propaganda campaign on Thursday, protecting against the "debt crisis" of workers, marked the planned 789 billion-free loan for the next six years.
When the ministers presented a promising plan, they added "cynics" to this decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything important that would be feasible," said the shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they missed it."
"All important announcements will be made after the elections if we win them"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Laborists insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future paintings, unlike the Tory proposals, which would want to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
However, liberal Democrats argue that the money generated by a tax increase and cost cut should be used to support expenditure in the next year and not to reduce deficits, and argue that plans are "based on sand".
The policy commenter BBC Nick Robinson said that the time of communication - for example the above inflation increases and is due to the inability to pay the fee in the next depth - that this could lead to the charge of the office in the election campaign if money would be obtained difficultly over a year later.
But the workers continue to provide special assistance if people will need it very much and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
The suspect budget'
Although ministers did not publish the details of expenditure after 2011, the economy indicated that it is clear that the reduction of public expenditure would be only the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
The renowned Institute of Budget Studies has reported that the number of cancellers is a major drawback in many areas, potentially involving transport, higher education and defence in the future.
"It's already very painful," said his director Robert Chote.
"Every important statement will come after the elections, if we win," added Roger Bootle, the economic adviser to the auditor of Deloitte's accounts.
"It was a report on the suspect's preliminary budget, and the markets realized it."
The FBI is conducting an investigation into 'American prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation into the prison in Pakistan with five Americans suspected of being linked to extremism.
Men were arrested for an attack on the house in Sargoda in the province of eastern Pangjab, as BBC reported to the US Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI reported that it was an investigation into whether it was the same men who were declared uninformed in their state of Virginia last month.
The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs has indicated that information on these men is also available.
Three of them are said to be the origin of Pakistan, one of them has Egypt's ancestors and the other comes from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions and circumstances in which they were held," said speaker Ian Kelly.
Speaking, the FBI told Katherine Schweit that the agency was informed about the arrest and was in contact with families of missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to identify their identity and their behaviour here and whether they are really wrong students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington reported that men were arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
It indicated that the house was always in the middle of the interest of the local police and that there was no charge against the men who had been arrested.
Foreign Minister Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, told the press agency Reuters, but stated that the United States must "cooperate with Afghanistan and Pakistan in the pursuit of the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The disappearance of these five students from home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Absence of amnesty for Iranian tyrants.
The situation in human rights in Iran is as bad as in the past 20 years, as reported by Amnesty International Group Report.
The report describes "the methods of torture" in the regime before and after the presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was a bit drunk with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected the above-mentioned criticism of this report on the maintenance of human rights.
Officials have marked this criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed after President Mahmúd Ahmadinejad's vote, which led to the largest street demonstration since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Ten of them were arrested and the complainants sentenced the last five persons to death.
The BBC writer in Tehran, John Leyne, who is now in London, stated that former High Leader Ajatoláh Ali Komíní has declared some forms of torture illegal and prohibited their execution in the correct facility Karizak.
Since then, however, almost no legal criticism has been tolerated, as our writer pointed out.
Improper recognition'
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old student of the team of computer technician Ibrahim Methari, who said he was accused of "working on Facebook" and protesting against the results of the election.
"I was often in my face," he said in a statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, my head... threatened me with correction and humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconsciously, Amnesty said.
In July the presidential candidate Mehdi Charroub was defeated after the protests and was sentenced to death in prison and others were raped.
Iran's senior state officials have been charged with rape, but they have admitted it to torture.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of an ex-prison who stated that he had been detained in a container with other 75 persons for a period of more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizka.
Amnesty took the view that the Iranian Parliament and the justices had organized committees to investigate arbitrary disturbances and the government's response, but indicated that the mandate and powers of the authorities were unclear and Parliamentary committees were published.
The group indicated that at least 90 persons were detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
In the city park, a lignite was created
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to change the memory in Bristol in the sedan road for the race.
The historic road for the race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete at financial prices.
On the top of the mountain road in Brandon Hill was a short jump bridge 100 m long in the park.
A fourth-year medical student named John Hickman said it was a beautiful view from the top of the sedan road, but it was really exciting.
It was a beautiful view of the shining light of the city down.
There were some of the best lies and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them are real talents," he added.
The prices were made for the best cuts - or manoeuvres on the sedan road.
After the fourth night's competition, he was left with the snow to break.
Still them and me
Can he be a Muslim Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters called for the ban on the construction of mines and generally spread news of the data Islamicization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic wrote and informed and wondered whether Muslim integration could be integrated into one of the most open secular societies on the continent.
After reading this book, some of the readers became admirers of the latest work, "Why the French don't like hats" (2006), this elegant and discussed study on controversial issues that divide and occupy the country for 15 years and their impact is still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and much more ambitious interest.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politics and the media have said about Islam in France, but what actually happened on the basis.
He spent a whole month in museums, schools and institutions that are now caring for 5 1⁄2 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, reproducing discussions between teachers and students on issues that are most worrying.
Should a Muslim enter a marriage contract in a town or a workshop (or both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about development and the rights of gays?
Can a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does Muslim have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system if you want to get a mortgage?
These are probably the world's controversial issues that are discussed and which are part of everyday life more than political dramas that occupy the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among others generally known persons, does not exclude Tarika Ramadana, Araba, a Muslim researcher and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open a discussion on how it can be a good Muslim and a good citizen in modern secular society.
They don't have any arguments for all their habits.
Conservatives are not dependent on the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists interviewed by Mr Bowen are accused of being anti-Selafi's—pronouncers of Puritan Sunni Islam combined in Saudi Arabia—this group is small but affects European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are appropriate.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
The question of how far the French politics (and the intellectual elite, which so garnishes the lay public) is actually given the idea of pluralism.
It is the view that Muslims have probably less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republic.
Even before the development of pragmatism, he found out "the excavation of raw materials".
Can it be a Muslim French? After reading this book, someone may have the ability to say "Yes, but not now."
The most unhappy view of the world
The Arctic is changing faster than the rest of the planet's life.
The limiting ice of these alarming speeds, which has an impact on animals and their survival as nowhere else.
The interests of oil companies, gas companies and fishermen must be focused on new natural water sources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers when they are forced to do so.
In the book "On the Dark Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and an illustrator, portrays the natural history of the icons of the North, the polar bear.
Well-known with complicated history and velvety procedures describes the long tradition of Polish researchers who have tried to strengthen the white bear.
A meeting of Admiral Nelson with a brave fourteen-year-old sailor who fought only with a male ball is really a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears carrying their own bodies killed were arrested and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared in one circuit.
Even today buildings in the zoo have typical area millions of times less than the area they have available to adults in the wilderness. The climate is quite suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hair of its coat.
You'll find more after the click!
Mr. Ellis is cut off from other writers and historians and often goes back to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopters and Indians are caught on foot and all are armed with executive attackive handguns that shoot their advantage.
It's ironic that it's playing in the water north of these two hunting nations and that ice will finally be the largest.
In his new book "After ice" Alun Anderson, former editor New Scientist, offers clear and unsatisfied responsibility for Arctic science and a spectacular summer view of how it can change its future.
Not all scientists have answers.
Neither meteorologists nor oceanographers have an adequate response to the rapid change.
That's because of a lack of experience.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th century, Fridtjof Nansen’s research routes were first marked by the movement of the current.
The ponorches for the cold war then drew up the resulting shifts when they submerged.
Satellite research and expanded field probes in sailing ice creams are a useful supplement, but many continue to ride thanks to the individual individuals who camp in the winter.
Mr. Anderson is looking at the extremely fragile world of sand in the Arctic ice, created by the melting of cold water that freezes when it freezes.
But from the height of that bear to the microscopic marvels inside, this is all due to the damage caused by the annual ice, which is sometimes reflected between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... it can be us'
6000 seafarers spent their time at graveyards in Arlington
Lieutenant De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a light candle on a soldier's grave, where he never met.
For him and other seafarers who made their way from Johnson in Jacksonville camp in North Carolina to the National Park in Arlington to get rid of their graves, it was the day when he took out the seven men and women who were wearing the same dress.
In a few months when we were born, we could be us, said Robinson about the fall soldiers.
If that happens to us, I'd like someone to do the same for me by showing me an account like I'm trying to do.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered this Saturday morning to lay off their vegetarian duties in several departments by the fifth act in Arlington.
In 1992, Morris Worcester, the owner of Worcester's funeral company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to surrender several hundred graveyards by the fifth act in Arlington.
Now it's 18 years old tradition when Mr. NMorill and his wife Karen make this trip every year and stands in different cities along the way to win the memory of military personnel and victims of terrorism.
Worcesters don't look for profits, bonds against America, which they claim in other countries.
In this year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 slots on the Arlington Bridge, the Pentagon Territory, the Fayetteville National Ground in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City, and the 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
In the second year, Walmart has committed more than $150,000 to purchase and transport money.
Charlene Hunt, a 70-year-old Westminster, said she was on her way to Arlington to honor her husband, a retired member of the armed forces.
Because her husband was not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way to repeat what he was doing.
It's a small way people can support our units, she said.
It's like a family funeral visit.
The volunteers walked through the courtyards of the hot material and walked through the surrounding grasslands and grasslands.
Volunteers aimed at older graves from the first and second world war and from the war in Vietnam because they are not visited as often as new graves
The birth was positive when the children played and held their hands together as they carried the young bullies to the rocky rocks.
Each round rope was darkly green with a small red cover of top piece.
Close to section 60, where the majority of the veterans from the war in Iraq and Afghanistan are preserved, remained really silent.
The Joint Service Organisation has awarded 1,000 victuals to the department, but the subsidized government has just filled this area.
Some cried sincerely, others prayed, and family and friends stayed with one another in cold weather.
Some read the title of the name, thrown into the rocks, while others decided to look at the small black names printed in the wet mud where no burial stones were yet placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who suffered tears from her eyes before her son's grave.
It's been eight hours from Zanesfield in Ohio to visit the place of the last rest of the Sergeant of the district worker David Shane Spicer who fell into battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. ..my son paid for it, rules.
"Even when I was away for a long time, I want to be the one who will remember it."
US government supplier bound by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government informed an American government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Saturday.
A supplier that was not yet identified worked for the Development Alternatives Inc. with a residence in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the American Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, together with the American interest section in Havana, sought access to the detained person who was imprisoned on 5 December.
Certain charges have not been published which, according to Cuban law, may be imposed by a Cuban citizen or a foreigner for almost anything that means "hazardous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including peaceful protests and critical states, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and words are considered to be serious criminal acts.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and bothered by government agents.
Ms. Sánchez repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country so that she could take the prices, but her permit was denied.
Keeping an American supplier can be a result of growing tension between the Communist Castro brother ruling in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seen as a "sustaining tactic" in improving relations with the island.
As the first to report the New York Times arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the disappearance of political prisons and the creation of more spaces for opposition, the United States will take counter-parliamentary steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-out comedites in the country where the average public employee may be doing 15 dollars a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; they are used mostly to send text messages because a 15-minute phone call would be more than a day away.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to join must make their name known to the government.
Access to many websites is denied.
America's detention in Cuba is a duty.
Most of the U.S. citizens in the prison in Cuba are behind the grids for violent acts, such as drug trafficking, led by Gloria Berbeno, the Press Office of the Section for American Interests in Havana.
Ms. Berbeno said she couldn't provide more information about prison.
Prisons and detentions were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in every other open company - let's give it free mobile phones - are criminal in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the American human rights programme, who recently published an irrefutable report on freedom in Cuba called "New Castro, the father of Cuba," as a reward for the installation of Raula Castra as leader of the country and reward for the generous elderly brother of Fidel.
Vivanco stated that complaints are often held, bound and imprisoned in one day.
He pointed out that all solutions would be more political and that the Cuban government often provokes negative reactions in the United States, even if these two countries are leading a wider dialogue.
Pakistani government workers are covering speculation about sending men to Afghanistan.
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities discovered a data source of spying concerning the sending of five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of American units, and said they hoped that this case could help to spread a network of terrorists who are following online and looking for radicalized young men.
Researchers reported that they had patrolled after seven rebel personalities known as Saifulláh who invited these men to Pakistan after the first time one of these men published a comment that approved terrorist attacks has a YouTube video site.
Saifillah took the lead in bringing these men to Pakistan, trying to help them get into the remote territory of Pakistan in Pakistan's native tribes, which is home to al-Qaedy and its terrorist training camps.
But the Pakistani reporting officer who reported the case indicated on Saturday that Saifüllah was unsuccessful in witnessing the leaders of al-Qaida and that men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, several days later they were excavated to the east quarter of Sarghody, far from the terrible mountains in the northwestern, which became the target of terrorists.
They were considered to be an attack unit.
The reason why they were raped was the officer who spoke about maintaining anonymity in view of the sensitivity of the case.
The officer stated that the men were not afraid and were still trying to reach agreement for access to al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was heard by the FBI - highlights the critical role of collectors in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps more importantly, identifying who is reliable.
Since the attacks on 11 September 2001, the American intelligence service has given the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaida.
The members of the organization are acting as guards, listing those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the Holy War and those who could be excommunicators.
The U.S. fake recruits were detailed in al-Kaydy's special investigation, led by analysts.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential access to the American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, an older analyst at the NEFA headquarters in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more careful in recent years as they are able to access them because American intelligence agencies have gained experts on their collection methods.
If we are trying to get into these groups, there is no better way than to act according to their collective model, which has already been so closely monitored? Mr. Kohlmann said.
This model is one of those that are far more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Kodani, requiring climate action
Ten of the protestors walked around the streets this Saturday and demanded more important action on climate than on the air carriers at the city congress centre Bella.
The protestors reported the number of participants in this event, but the police claim that the number was close to 25,000.
The event was relatively calm and the mob of masked activists placed several small investments near a group of government buildings in the center of the city.
On the day when a small event occurred during the discussions on the climate that followed the UN, thousands of activists went through the city and brought out transparency with English letters "This is not planet B" (i.e. second order) and one in Spanish, which said "The country says 'good'."
The protest was attended by several celebrants, including Danish models and photographs of Helen Christensen, who indicated that she had traveled to her mother’s home in Peru and provided me with information on the unsatisfied state of the country on which the effects of climate change are still on.
This is part of the reason why we have decided to join this great step -- to go through the world and appeal to the leaders of the world to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it's necessary to do it, but it can't keep running away from it.
The police prevented the protesters from approaching the center of Bella and reported that she had detained 19 people in the first row because they had masks or were wearing capes.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during the demonstration.
According to one of the non-participated fans who are not in front of being identified because they are involved in climate talks, active masking as athletes and in black clothing, several investments were placed near the Kodana main channel, which is located near several ministries.
They were acting at the buildings, he introduced, started with the lights, but then it followed "a few great explosions."
Within the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the departure during the afternoon.
But the protest probably didn't get into the knowledge of key officials, such as Su Weie, the main Chinese climate leader.
When asked if the demonstration had a constructive impact on international relations, he replied "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (it is actually something I don't know).
Then he went on in the kitchen and he said, "Because the story is wide, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He followed whether he was ill or helpful depending on the views of everyone.
It is seen in the focus of the broad public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words, "You can also say that it is a violation of your conduct or the freedom of other people.
Date of test removed persistent racial differences
Last week's federal testimony on the knowledge gained from mathematics was the first of the good news about the public school in Colombia.
Although the cross remains far behind the high-impact systems of the country, the witness has shown greater progress in fourth and eighth classes in the last two years than in cities, including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains to be hidden from the latest numbers of the National Certificate Centre for Progress in Research is the persistent differences in the knowledge gained between African Americans and white students, both on the local and on the national page.
In the last two years, the average result of the fourth-class white sharks in Colombia has increased from 267 to 270 points (of 500 possible), but in their African breeders, only three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap between 2007 and 2009 has indeed increased from 53 points to 57 points.
The progress of the Afro-Americans in the eighth class remains essentially balanced, with a standoff on statistics one point from 245 to 245.
The mean result in white cells was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in the horizon for six years is not just exciting.
The difference between the white and black peaks of the fourth grade in 2003 when the first NAEP was held in the series was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved in children in both groups improved during this period, the difference of complaints was close to 58.
Some graduates in the course of the last week have expressed their appreciation for the results of the famous secretaries of Michelle A. Rhee and aged Adrian M. Fenty (D) who have been encouraged by the white students where they have already had high results.
This would indicate that we have increased the amount of support for those at the highest end of the stage, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, Executive Director D.C. Voice, an uneducated group that promotes equality of teaching in the class.
Not climbing up and down due to two or three points, the member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large) committee, who has a daughter in the fourth primary school in Eaton, said.
Often critical of Ms. Rhee's management style, Ms. Brown said that the report on the results of the test meant a secondary school in the city is in a reliable position and requires attention.
It's obvious that you always want to see the posters, and I respect them.
But what's amazing is that we didn't spend almost any time and energy that needed to be awarded to our middle school.
Ms. Rhee said that the strength of the circle was to continue looking for better ways to focus on the needs of students with low results.
As a result, for example, some teachers in the use of new basics of reading, the Wilson reading system, aimed at students of higher levels of basic schools and high school students who were unable to manage the reading bases in their former careers, are significantly behind their peers.
Each day's mathematics and the basics of mathematics education into six classes, highlighting games and real life experiences that have been achieved under former director Clifford Janeyi, can be counted on the progress of NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I just think we should continue to work and do the best we can for those students who remain below the level, Mrs. Rhee said.
The others said that the results of the NEP explained whether Ms. Rheeo could continue to improve the overall performance of the system and continue to provide other money and resources for low-performance schools, which are necessary for reducing the gap.
This is a certain prized dilemma Mrs. Michel Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, where he studies the results of tests in urban areas.
The Convention procedure is to focus on the means and administrative reforms to schools located in the top parts of Colombia.
This can lead to political tensions that are directed against an important agenda.
But the challenge is also for other city leaders who are trying to keep the middle line between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of major schools.
We need to exercise our school skills so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be confident that their children will be given extraordinary public education.
Mr. Janey, now head of the school in Newark, pointed out in an interview this week that the main factor in reducing the gap between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the course of order to achieve the right of school.
You have to get up to 200 days so you can make changes, said Mr. Janey, who concluded a contract with his Lone Teachers Association for a school year of 185 days, which is a "principal" for seeking greater increase in the next year.
Make higher education part of a better future
The train bus went to the Gettysburg college with loud breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, emerged and immediately started on white columns, cholera façades and smarandly green grass.
Gracielin's parents had difficulty graduating from high school in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the bottom of the road.
Now she and the other eight classes in the group were investigating Gettysburg, where the school made $38690 a year, their position was more than threatening visitors to inspire potential students.
Yeah, that's it! she called Graciel who would like to study medicine when their guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Sir, really? The rules were conceived when they produced a low level of teachers to students.
The Pennsylvania railway was one of the seven who visited their class trip and were now completely interested in the future news: There is no question whether you will enter the train.
The question is where it comes from.
However, there is a problem with the high number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who are excluded from high school or infirm as minors, but statistics are available for those who receive further education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, five of the "spirit generation" of Spanish college students - amazingly achieved results show that many of their immigrant parents, most Mexicans and people in Central America, have reached the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers point out, because it supports their point of view for generations that have played a crucial role in the field of labour forces in the country.
Those who have graduated from high school say they had a natural gift to school and a natural battle and success.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and sought ways to compensate for the ignorance of American school.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciele and millions of children who would like to graduate further - especially if these efforts are overdue.
If we take into account that children come from low income groups whose parents have no experience and ability to help them focus on the system, whatever simple approach in each single paragraph does not solve it, says Patricia Gándara, a University of California in Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American region.
We need to think about providing these children with a comprehensive system of pre-school education in all ways to attend high school.
The federal programme that financed Graciely's drive by bicycle is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than US$300 million annually for local school systems for launching further preparatory programmes that start for students from small middle-income groups and continue until these students do not finish high school.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, of whom more than % have enrolled in college, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
Iraq's Ministry of Oil Industry reached agreement with 10 foreign mining companies
In spite of the concern about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to adopt significant redundancies to rebuild its non-debt infrastructure during two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs with foreign slave companies, which means that Chinese, Russian and European slave companies are ready to play an important role in the reconstruction of the Iraqi slave industry, the protected decades of war and sanctions.
The American companies left with their capital share in just two of the 10 fields exported.
Seven American companies paid for their participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one submitted a lost offer.
Two American companies reached an agreement on the field that was stolen in June.
The vast share of American oil giants in an open Iraqi mining industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and the place of American companies you have here in the first row on the road to Asia and Europe, said Ruba Husari, editor Iraq Oil Forum, online reporting.
It'll be a long time before something else is on sale in Iraq.
The security concerns highlighted by mass-coordinated bombings in the internal and political instability, as well as the arrest of American troops, are likely to reflect American companies from many of the most intensive companies in Iraq, which have probably third largest raw materials reserves, say analysts.
In some cases, American companies have been in an accident, in particular the Chinese and other governments controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they do not meet the shareholders.
Exxon Mobile and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that concluded agreements with the ministry.
Former American companies, such as Chevron and ConcoPhillips, who maintained close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of the Red Industry and offered technical assistance in the past years, left empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of this week.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp. participated in offers on more contracts than all other companies and went with large shares in contracts on two main fields.
We all know that China is trying to become the main economic force, as well as the technological force, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Assam Jihad.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be comparably competitive and meet its obligations against Iraq.
The companies which were previously selected to submit tenders, which were then compared to the ministry at barl prices and the ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the current level of output on each field.
A spy planner al-Qaedy was apparently killed in Pakistan.
In the case of American rockets at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, it was likely to kill a spy planner al-Qaedy operation, as announced by the U.S. Anti-Terrorist Department's 5th official.
As it has been confirmed, it could be the second death attack on one of the highest leaders of terrorists.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rockets hit their car on Thursday near the city of Miran Sáh in the province of Northern Vaziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
The local authorities noted that the rockets were fired from the plane without a crew of the type operated by the CIA under illegal domestic landmines.
They were mentioned on a white car that led to the Afghan border when he was arrested, the officer introduced the Pakistani intelligence intelligence agency he called from Miran Shah.
The officer indicated that local armed forces had come to the point and quickly enjoyed what had happened from the "totally destroyed bodies".
The local authorities were not able to verify the identity of the victim, but two U.S. anti-terrorist department officials quoted an unspecified witness who stated that Somalia was after death.
Somalia has been identified as a highly-established military planner of al-Qaida operations, which led the operations of terrorist groups outside the region of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in the rehabilitation all over the world, said a senior officer who was not supposed to be appointed, who introduced a sensitive attitude of American air strikes in Pakistan.
If he had stopped such a central position, he would probably have been involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from Al-Kaydy's highest leadership and planned possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another U.S. official said Somalia was in the hierarchy al-Qaedy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He didn't have to be a well-known person for some Americans, but he didn't humiliate himself in any way to contact us and our allies, said another official.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking leader al-Qaedy or Taliban who should be killed from September when he was killed by Nimudin Jalolov, the leader of the military unit in the tribe of domestic tribes and three other top populative leaders.
The period of attacks initiated by the CIA with no pilot flights has declined since the year from average operations of about six months per two, according to Long War's logbooks, web pages prepared by the non-profit group.
The reduction may be justified in the improved tactics of terrorist groups which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also killing persons suspected of being informants.
The Supreme Delegation of the United Nations was represented in Kabul.
The High Representative of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, announced on Friday that he would like to resign from his post in March and end such a turbulent working period that was charged with widespread corruption at the presidential election in Afghanistan, supported by the UN.
Eide is leaving because Obama's administration has decided to send another 30,000 American soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN delegation stated that it supported growth but expressed concern that the United States time-consuming situation which began in 18 months should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO states to reduce their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and send the correct signal to Afghans that they have confidence in the international community, Eide introduced a telephone interview from Kabul.
An acceptable commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed on the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civil servants helping with the political change in Afghanistan.
The stand on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he didn't give up, but he just made a promise that he had given his family in March 2008 that it would take only two years to reach Kabul.
He said he wanted to report the UN.
General Secretary Ban Ki-moon now indicated that he would need time to find a reward.
As I said, it's the highest time to look after the next one, Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month vacuum between my cousin's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban started looking for a reward.
The officials indicated that it was decided between Staffan di Misturu, who had a Swedish-Italian origin and previously led the UN mission to Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, France, which previously led the UN peacekeeping operation.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused of being accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won in country presidential elections from masking the presence of mass voting machines.
Eide rejected this claim, but pointed out that Galgraith's charge -- which was dropped -- "was very damaging to the mission, because there was a high level of skis with regard to international principles" at the vote.
Eide stated that he proposed a meeting with the highest representative of the citizens due to the coordination of the withdrawal effort to lead the United States forces in Afghanistan.
He also called for the leadership of the UN to allow his approach to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries who would borrow them for the Afghan mission, because he wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money was needed properly.
Eide expressed frustration over limiting its efforts in Afghanistan and pointed out that the difficult UN rental regulations undermine its ability to use its capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I had a chance to get from flower only one person, he said.
It's a disaster and I can't continue.
Gates: Iran faces another sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon enter Iran "other significant sanctions" because of the lack of commitment to its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq during a week's journey through areas where they are fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, were fighting against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to the military's question about likely development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I learned something from Iraq in the last six years, [this] is an unimaginably unpredictableness in the war.
The Administrative Ombudsman decides in the sanctions package which could affect the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates indicated that some of these sanctions could also reach ordinary Iran.
He said "the package of victory and defence" would require "to take the Iranian government to really feel less safe with nuclear weapons", because "its citizens will suffer extremely" sanctions.
According to the fifth opinion issued by the White House speaker Robert Gibbs, the administration has launched a European leader to warn that Iran will have serious consequences if it does not implement its nuclear programme in full compliance with the UN Nuclear Safety Committee and its supervisory authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists on developing its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
During the discussions in Geneva on 1 October, he noted that he wanted to return to discussions on limiting his nuclear programme and agreed that he would provide the essential part of his enriched uranium resources by replacing the rapidly needed fuel for the reactor for medical research.
The Administration has established an agreement such as a way to build trust between both parties and to get time to deal.
But from that time on, it seems, Iran withdraws from provisional agreements - partly because of this, the expert points out, because Iran's leadership is divided into views on whether to engage in the United States.
Frankly, when it comes to Iran's solidarity with the international community in the case of some proposals that it has actually agreed with at the beginning of October, I think that this has led to the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, on a journey that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set the deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to proposals before returning to other elections, including follow-up, which Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton called at the time "degrading sanctions".
In the opinion issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the UN condemned on Thursday what it called "undeserved and unsubstantiated charges" to some members of the Security Committee on Iran's nuclear activities and indicated that it wanted to continue its discussions with the United States and five other world powers "on the achievement of a suitable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before he left for Kurdistan, rich in rock to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish representatives in Irbil.
It maintains a high pressure between Kurdy and the Iraqi majority, especially due to restrictions, property rights and the distribution of income.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent the maintenance of US plans to limit the number of American soldiers from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to alleviate Kurdish concerns from persistent depression. The US official site quoted Gates when he told Massoud Barzaani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, which they read that "The Mother of the Earth is too exhausted to enjoy more children" and "One child means more than one grave".
Then they learned that when the official government places in Shanghai, alarmed by low fertility and ageing populations in their city, suddenly changed the course this year and began to stir up young couples, their reactions were immediate and resolved: Never.
We've always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We haven't left anything for another, says Wang, 31 years old, manager of human resources that has an 8-month-old son.
For more than 30 years China's policy of having only one child has been introduced and has created two generations only of notoriety pubelit and gambling children, who are affected by the phenomenon of "little czar", the country is at risk of a population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple compared to six before the policy entered into force, according to UN data.
The distribution of the population, where the population is aged 60 and higher, is expected to grow from 16.7 per cent in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of around 20 per cent.
Inequality is larger coastal cities with population with high school education, for example in Shanghai.
Loni people aged 60 and above created almost 22 per cent of registered citizens in Shanghai, while birth was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said that many couples must have children to "help to reduce the proportions of older populations and reduce the number of working forces in the future".
He says it's "to be old, it doesn't mean to be rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Progressive calmdown
As introduced into the 1978 constitution, the Chinese policy of one child is likely to be the most controversial mandate of the Communist party governments today.
Two people who have been corrupt in politics have been subjected to inconsistencies -- up to a third of their annual pay in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China's official sites have been pursuing a policy that has helped the country to prevent critical exploitation of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been denied political protection.
In rural areas, some officials encouraged pregnant women to share with their second child.
In addition, many couples had to face social selection losses leading to an unintended high level of men against women.
In recent years, popular officials have been progressively more peaceful in their attitude toward the policy of one child.
In 2004, the rules allowed extra exceptions - including citizens of the city, members of national minorities and cases where men and women were single - and in 2007 they calmed down their strong lines of hair.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the People's Research Institute of Beijing University, said that central government officials had previously discussed radical changes such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was single.
In June Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign for generations.
Almost overnight, there were complaints from parents that they had only one child, replaced by copies of the regulation, detailing how to have another child and how to ask for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet with money in their homes and to enter the airport.
They also promised to provide home and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The response was cold, the family planning officers introduced.
Injury response
Although officials in one rural town around Shanghai noted an increase in the interest of two people who wanted to have a second child after the start of the campaign, most of the city districts did not report any changes.
The city of Huinan with a population of 115,000, for example, still recorded four to five cases per month.
The authorities in Shanghai stated that despite the campaign, the number of city births in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, the head of the family planning committee in the Czech Republic, said that financial concerns were probably the main reason why people don't want more children.
They want to give it to the best first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she liked to have two children and was legally allowed to do so.
But as many Chinese who have only insufficient health and life insurance are provided by the government.
Without a touch net, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West view the policy of one child badly as a controversial legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in seven months of pregnancy in a relationship with the first child.
Yeah, we were excited about the chance of having more than one child.
But there's only one problem in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples point out psychological reasons for behavior.
Wang, director of human resources, says that they want only one child, because she was also the only one: "We were focused on our families and all cared about us.
We weren't used to providing care, and we really didn't want to take care of the other.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who is a government translator company, has expressed it much more indistinctly.
For two-year-olds from middle-class families who reduced birth, he said to be successful means to be self-sufficient.
Today’s 20 and 30 years are watching parents as they spend the first days of the Chinese experiment with capitalism and they don’t want this way of living for themselves, he says.
Just one child makes enormous demands on parents' time, she says.
The mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still controversial questions about space -- "You have to stop your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have a summary prepared at a time when the child is 9 months old for good pre-school training.
Most of his friends want to have peace with one child, says Che, but not two.
We're the first generation with higher living standards, she says.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
The UN Group has developed a emission reduction plan.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterised by the far-reaching existence and mutual sensitivity -- again on Friday focused on the release of a document proposing an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gas emissions during the next 40 years with industrialized nations, which are not most of the most complex in the near future.
The text which may provide an output for the final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions highlights the remaining obstacles as it illuminates the road forward.
But important progress was seen in the meetings that took place in the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Kodana next week.
This text does not necessarily indicate how much money rich countries should provide for the poor to deal with global short-term and long-term inflation.
And it gives a whole range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and control emerging economies so that they can limit their carbon emissions and what a high limit should be on global warming, which will still be capable of tolerated by policy makers.
This adds a high dose of flexibility, says John Coequyt, top representative of the Washington Club of Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, a summary of 180 pages of the text from the meeting to focus on what the US Climate Officer Yvo de Boer described as "a big picture".
It lays down the scope for a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent by year compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during this period.
Together, the country would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union quickly made a five-year commitment to provide $3.6 billion over the next three years to help poor countries adapt to climate change -- from the management of floods and drought to the prevention of mitigation.
However, on Friday, he introduced the same type of verbal firearms that were transported during the discussions last week.
The US Special Envoy for Climate Issues Todd Stern rejected the statement requiring a mandatory limitation of greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries in comparison with the willingness of the major developing economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
Posun reported that Obama’s administration had developed a strict line against China without Bush’s administrative officer just two years ago.
The United States does not enter into a contract without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of actions, said Stern, who also claimed that text is not sufficient to secure restrictions and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after the Chinese mayor of Foreign Minister He Yafei informed the US prime minister on climate issues that either lack of "local understanding" or "extreme irresponsible" had led to a week earlier to the announcement that the United States would not help financially China to cope with global warming.
With the future of the economic routes of the world's major powers in the past, the savings have been lost both within the developing world and between the industrial world and the developing economies.
The current war is mainly about the conservation of individual economies rather than about the conservation of planets, between China and the United States as regards the fulfilment of their respective obligations, while poorer nations warn that two tenths of the world's most affected countries ignore the scientific imperatives of greater action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegation from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the main powers are fighting against those who should bear costs to limit greenhouse gas, while the vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in their search for a way to prevent large issuers from taking responsibility for their actions.
It is clear that the new economic hegemony is developing, Ulate said, which also serves as a regional adviser to regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international protection of nature.
Some countries that are most vulnerable to climate change have indicated that they would like to continue the process of legally binding agreements in Kodani, but most of the main participants said that the best outcome of the talks would be the political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, has created a 24-page proposal for an agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Mitzger, who led the international climate agreement on the benefits of the European Commission, said that the application by small island nations "have called for political pressure on the whole political process" partly because they are now united and demand action from growing economies, such as China and India.
The meeting called for a new urgency when delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining controversial issues before the heads of government reached agreement.
The high position of officials, such as the Indian Minister for the Protection of the Living Environment Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Prime Minister, emerged from the planes and passed through the halls of Bella to the closed door and new conferences, and could also issue notices that will be assessed next week.
The simple size of the gathering - when 13,000 people were moved from and to the congress centre every day, the guitars were staged on the night of the ironic view of the countries they were supposed to have been sent, and it came to hand-on-hand hand-on paper more than electronic mail -- managed output.
Intensity is only the foundation: almost all key ministers in Kodan were present and previously in the middle of 60 heads of state.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the mayor of the Minister for Global Policy for International Protection of Nature.
They're getting heavy weights.
The first British train with speed 140 miles per hour predefined this morning's feeling
at 5:13 a.m., the star fell into the darkness on the mark of the train's departure, which meant the revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach a speed of 140 miles per hour from Ashford in Kent to St. Pancras London and exceed 58 miles per 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and entered the first high-speed personal interview outside lLndýn.
It is hoped that the new service will eventually connect Britain with the international network of fast, reliable trains and connect great agglomerations to Midland, North and Scotland.
The said standing waters should reduce transport time in personal transport and on commercial roads and traffic from aircraft and vehicles to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on the roads.
Theoretically, three main political parties were allowed to get this vision.
But tens of billions of volunteers needed to build a new national railway network, an inevitable battle on projects and concerns about environmental degradation have now led to the construction of British high-speed routes.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a realistic study, presented its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, as stated by the Times.
She provided him with a detailed map of the track of another planned high-speed network.
The new track of London's connection with the West Midland was designed to be five metres in urban areas and four quarters where the impact on the environment could be problematic.
In the open country, a final route was planned up to 25 m.
HS2 also proposes to specify three options for the expansion of the high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer the call.
The preferred option is to confiscate the shape of letter Y when one high speed track should be brought to the west Midland.
The road should be divided close to Birmingham with one village going from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other leading north to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One piece should be taken to Scotland.
"It looks like it's come to the most successful election," said the trainer.
As soon as it's done, travel times between London and Edinburgh will end in two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow the travelling trip between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared with more than one hour in the presence.
The proposals should enable trains to drive speed 2250 miles an hour, which would be made from the British network as soon as possible in Europe.
The initial route is already designed to carry trains within 400 m , which would be able to transport 1100 persons.
Up to 18 interviews could operate every hour on the London-Birmingham track.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
In view of the capital limitation, it is assumed that the existing station would expand in order to take up a high-speed network.
Railway industry experts say that only San Pancras International or Euston offers such potential.
Lord Adonis will know whether or not to implement this scheme, but broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that the deadline for the final decision will not come before the general elections.
Even if he's driving the car, the network should be built on parts.
Trains should first be introduced not on high-speed routes, but already existing routes north of Birmingham and keep driving times between London and Scotland for over three hours.
This is assumed to be a decisive binding point for ensuring the transition from aircraft to train, a reference point for the revolution to rail.
The taxpayers won a mortgage of 75000 pounds on Tory's orange
Alan Duncan's former satisfactory lavender of Tory in the parliamentary show, the taxpayers paid thousands of free of charge last year for the Orange which he built in his house in the electoral district.
the talking party behind the prison, which was degraded by David Cameron because he complained that the messengers lived "of fate", raised his hypothesis to 75,000 pounds to build a duly furnished expansion in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to take into account the particular interest, a total of 100 free monthly for taxpayers.
The general authorities accepted orders in time and were thus not heard by Sir Thomasen Legge, who conducted control of Member States' expenditure. Last night Mr. Duncan said his requirements "were likely to be cleaner or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns two double-bed houses for all in his electoral districts Rutland and Melton.
Homes are worth about a million pounds.
There is a kitchen, living room and food on the ground, but the financial authority agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added a winter garden that is marked as "orangerie" in plans.
Neighbors describe it as a "for entertainment and hospitality."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increased loan during the last check by the Committee on General Standards and Privileges in the final equation of the mortgage.
The Committee informed him last month that he had broken the rules after examining his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the populace security to the mortgage of 271406 free from his property in London at home in his election campaign, which he bought in 1991, the year before he became a member of the parliamentary cabinet.
The documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan was using about 1400 pounds a month for mortgages until March of the year.
In depth, his wages increased to more than 1800 pounds per month.
The interest in the RBS payment of Mr. Duncan's mortgage could not be changed at this time, which means that all of this was intended for financing loans of 75000 pounds.
The standard change in RBS’s mortgage payments decreased by 7.94 per cent in December 2007 by 4 per cent in March of the year in which they remained.
The last document of the general authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to award 1250 pounds per month in May.
Mr. Duncan gave up his job as a steel manager of the House in September after a secret editor filmed it and said that the messengers must survive "on a schedule" after the expenses scandal.
"In principle it's born, you have to live on a farm and it's acting like a s**t."
He said, "I lost money for my garden and money and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could smell the whole damn part, but I can't do it."
The messenger, a millionaire from his former career as a slave trader, was first called to explain his release in May, when it was shown that he had pledged thousands of pounds for his loan, even before the approval of the financial authority that "may be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug a pit in the shape of a library sign in Mr. Duncan's bedroom for a protest after it turned out to be 4,000 free for three years.
When asked about raising mortgages last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was because of raising capital which was approved as a financial authority, so then Leggem."
He added: "This is not a controversial question of hiding and calling or violating rules or anything else.
It's absolutely the same sign down there, according to the rules, right, and that's all.
It would soon be many other ways to be cleaner or simpler."
Come to see the chat carefully on the Brightonian coast with the adventurous calendar.
The coastal chats in Brighton found a new meaning of life in the winter months as an interactive adventure calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group, which promotes religious creativity, invited 24 owners to open their chats every day in December and to use holiday parlors as the subject of this exhibition.
The event started on December 1, when visitors were allowed to watch the last chat from 17:30 to 18:30 each day, and the biscuits bread and mixed wine offered free.
The selected guides included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël when the chat represented the work of Janety Tozer, local artists.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a television marketing assistant from Hove, is a priest without scholarship in the Chichester diocese and leading Beyondu.
He said: "We want to make worship much more important for people in post-Christian society.
"Why should we as a church expect people to come to another old building? I have a feeling that the church should come to people and serve in a way that is boring.
"The idea of an adventurous calendar in chats was just like a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and pulsating place and we have tried to try and present this spiritual path."
Strong mobilization in Kodani and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went to the streets on Saturday with a requirement for a comprehensive and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Kodani, demonstrated around the world and in Kodan, where hundreds of people were arrested by the police on this occasion.
At least thirty thousand people according to police sources and hundreds of thousands according to organizers demonstrated in the Danish capital in the cold season at the time of the UN climate conference, which aims to enter into the fifth agreement which could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, announced that the growing global mobilization, which clearly proves to be a contemporary manifestation, contributed to the "political tax" of the possible failure in Kodan.
According to the AFP journalist, incidents in the Danish capital soon after the start of the tour began, when about 300 demonstrators dressed in black began to break out of the shells and chairs.
The regular police got very busy right away.
The entire police reported 600 to 700 arrests and indicated that they were particularly concerned about members of the Blacks Blocks, ultra-racial independent groups that have already appeared in depth at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of action, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without distinction" and pointed out that about a hundred of them were in the streets and in the seat "Keeped in the streets still on Saturday evening" and that even over extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the tour was quietly headed to the Bella Center, where she was conducting the meeting.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to dig inside.
For the speakers, a podium was set up prior to the spiritual meeting at the festivals for the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most protesters came by bus and train from large European cities and besides Africans there were also large numbers of participants from Asia, including some Chinese and Korean.
Nearly 3,000 people dressed in blue beaches have created the first assembly in Kodana in the next hour, and this is because of the group Friends of the Earth who wanted to create " blue waves" for "the righteous climate".
Today we are going to the streets to demand an environmental debt settlement in the south's prosperity, explains Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino soldier from the Jubilee South Coalition in Kodani.
We can't say yet: it's time for the Beninan singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and water flows are flowing, we can walk into them today and it was never possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 through the adoption of the UN Treaty, the struggle for a different world approached organic organisations.
French European President José Bove, one of the world's fighting positions, said he came to Kodana with the aim of "promoting climate and social justice". "At present there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight against other worlds".
The first exhibitions began in the Asia-Techoma region, where many islands are especially sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people went to the streets by organizers.
There were several hundred people in Manila, mostly students, in red clothes and with bags of rising energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, a number of hundreds of demonstrators have gone into the streets with a demand for significant anti-climate measures.
In France, protests organized by "350" attended by hundreds of people, particularly in Paris, Marseille (they), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has chosen her president, Georgia condemns it as "fraction"
Abkhazia elected her president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi declares this step as "fraction".
About 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Gruzin War in August 2008 on control over the South Ossetia, which is another former Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
Free rooms closed at 17 hours GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission, 58% attended a few hours before the closure of the electoral facilities.
The first preliminary results should be reported on Saturday night.
All five candidates, including the executive president Sergei Bagapša, categorically reject the idea of meeting with Georgia, which condemned these elections.
These choices are frescoes.
On the other hand, Georgian President Michael Saakashvili "flys that Abkhazia has completely fallen into the Russian government," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaldze.
In addition to Russia, the independence of this territory was recognized by only 26,000 citizens of Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considered it to be part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by the Russian forces.
After the division from Georgia, after the conflict between 1992 and 1993, where several thousand people were killed, Abkhazia is trying to show through the vote that it is ready to return to international policy.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said AFP Kvarchij Lightlan, a 54-year-old historian who also acknowledged that she voted for President Bagapše.
It was one of those who came to volunteer to the school in the capital city of Sukhumi, to a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of the Russian government is the main theme of presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea coast, which can be raised by a beautiful nature.
All over this small country with 216,000 inhabitants are located large billboards with Bagapše by Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, on the west side of the country, the Russian officials who came to watch the wall of the election were waiting for a warm reception from the medieval old Beslan Arshby.
"We, Abkhaz, we are grateful," he said in a small order, with a view to supporting Moscow and in particular her decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, Alexe Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, said and added to this conclusion.
The opposition, which was represented in the elections by former Vice-President Raul Khadzhimbo and two traders Zauss Ardzinbo and Beslan Boutbo, criticized contracts concluded in the long year with Moscow, such as a contract allowing Russia to control the Abkhazia railway network for 10 years.
Fifth candidate Vitali Bganba says he does not support neither the current government nor the opposition.
To win in the elections, a 50% plus one vote is required.
If none of the candidates fail to achieve this outcome, the decisive battle must end within two weeks.
Weather: Show in the world, events in Kodani
Tens of thousands went to the streets on Saturday with a requirement for a comprehensive and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Kodani, showing around 700 people around the world and in Kodani, where the police arrested about 700 people on this occasion.
At least thirty thousand people according to police sources and hundreds of thousands according to organizers have demonstrated since the cold season in the Danish capital, which is hosted by 18 December by a delegation from 193 countries agreeing to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the tour was quietly headed to the Bella Center, where she was conducting the meeting.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to dig inside.
For the speakers, a podium was set up prior to the spiritual meeting at the festivals for the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to the AFP journalist, incidents soon after departure occurred when a group of several sets of demonstrators, dressed in black and armed helmets and clothes, began to break out.
The police were immediately locked up and attacked without waiting, and several protesters jumped to the ground.
The entire police reported 600 to 700 arrests and indicated that they were particularly concerned about the members of the Blacks Blocks, ultra-racial independent groups that have already appeared in depth at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Later this afternoon, one police officer was hit by a shoulder bone on his face and four cars were burned near the corner of the nearby incidents that resulted in approximately 20 persons being detained by police sources.
We're focusing on the extremist group, protecting speech police Henrik Jakobsen, while the Wrestling police are back in the air.
Most of the protesters who came by bus or train from large German cities from London, Amsterdam and Milan were European sources.
But there were also many Asians, including some Chinese and Korean or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people dressed in blue linens were created in the following hours in Kodani, the first meeting on behalf of the Group of Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create "blue wool" for "the righteous climate".
Today we are going to the streets to demand an environmental debt settlement in the south's prosperity, explains Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino soldier from the Jubilee South Coalition in Kodani.
We can't say yet: it's time for the Beninan singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and water flows are flowing, we can walk into them today and it was never possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 through the adoption of the UN Treaty, the struggle for a different world approached organic organisations.
French European President José Bove, one of the world's fighting positions, said he came to Kodana with the aim of "promoting climate and social justice". "At present there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight against other worlds".
The Oxfam organisation has called for a number of prominent personalities, such as the Danish model Helen Christensen or former UN High Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson to discuss the tax.
The first exhibitions began in the Asia-Techoma region, where many islands are especially sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people went to the streets by organizers.
Several hundred people were present in Manila before the main office of the Philippines, mostly students in red clothing and with a jacket of rising the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several percent of the protesters also met with a request for a significant response to climate change.
In France, protests organized by "350" attended by hundreds of people, particularly in Paris, Marseille (they), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
The subjects of the earthquake and the earthquake will be strengthened in the context of the reform of the General Assembly, Chatel said.
The Minister of Education, Luc Chatel, announced during the JDD magazine discussion on Sunday that the subjects of the journal and the landscape will be in the context of the reform of the general gymnaecium "commissioned", although their education will no longer be required in the last year of the Gymnaign with a focus on accurate science.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week and for all, the same program of general culture will be confirmed by Chatel.
According to the Minister, "it should end with cover," because he says that specialization S is not focused on accurate knowledge" but "mostly the best students are in it."
The specialisation of the EU and L cannot be for the sub-specialisations, it continues and emphasizes: "I have heard many stories and intellectuals who would have insisted that in the last year of professional gymnasiums, there is no study of geography and geography."
The investigation of the IFop agency, which published Humanité daily on Saturday, showed that seven French people from the 10 (69%) disagree with the government project to cancel compulsory literacy and agriculture studies in the matrimonial year with specialization S, which is why many intellectuals and teachers criticized this resolution both on the left and on the right.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "it does not take into account" to delete philosophy in the specialization programme S of the master calendar.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended reform in the education of students, while 16 organisations (students and committees) called for participation in the morning mobilisation against this project, which they consider to be a victim of the educational education of future high school teachers.
Within the framework of Master's study 2 (M2), at the beginning of the annual sampling focused on their team and at the end of the year, the Minister explained.
The participants will be trained during the second year of the Master's study, and in the first year they will appear before the polls as a professor-student.
If you read all the steps that will be offered to you before the reception procedure, you will get more experience with the request, almost 300 hours, continued.
The Minister also announced that he would propose "private right to education", which is still not available in national education.
The project was re-confirmed for the destruction of the school map by 2012.
At the elite University of École, normal superiors have 15 minutes to convince them of the climate.
Fifteen minutes on the presentation of the objectives of the Kodana Summit: this is the challenge announced by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Development (GIEC) at the University of Ecole Normal Superiore on Ulm Street.
As one AFP journalist reported, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conference, which is a one-day seminar composed of fifteen-minute experts' contributions that will be targeted and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that touched people and based on what they should learn more, explained at the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of this seminar that received the name of the local lake fish they called students.
About twenty contributing experts are selected from individual scientific disciplines and explained that the choice is based on their charisma.
About climate warming "we can talk about hours, but we can also gather basic targets in a few minutes" said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke before a dozen audiences without prior notes, only using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed the hope that the audience will recognize that "the Codnance Conference is opposed to very seriously prepared scientific foundations".
The video set out in these presentations will be posted on the website of schools since December 15.
The next "Ernest" seminar is planned to celebrate and will be followed by regularity every two months.
Delay in payments: increased surveillance in prisons, planned measures
The Committees of Prison Guards announced on Friday "general mobilisation", as they requested them to be paid the premiums and the dues for the financial reasons set out on the ice.
The Federal FO (2nd Board of Supervisors) requested employees who would not have a job to participate in demonstrations that took place in the morning before the prison facilities and to "block" them and thus warn them of "the theft of their possessions".
The CGT for Prison Supervisors (3rd Committees of this sector) has called for "calling together in individual prisons and starting major mobilisation" with the fact that "responsibility and unfriendly" and "times and fees for work at night, on Sundays and on holidays" were not paid in October.
First Board of Supervisors, Federal Union of Prison Guards (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilisation (...) with a view to expressing discomfort and frustration".
The Governing Council and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of surpluses increased significantly in 2009 and not all were included in the financial budget, but ensures that the debt shares will be rewarded in January.
The office concluded by the end of the day that Michele Alliot-Mariot sent to the prison officers' committees a communication ensuring that the payment will be made next month.
I know of the efforts the prison staff makes to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system, writing to the Ministry in its communication.
I ordered the prison administration to take immediate action to give up the situation that caused by the poor estimate of the amount of time spent in the future which has never been repeated to Minister Alliot-Mariot.
The Prosinc may therefore be low, with the exception of management staff who receive famous awards for the performance and performance of the objectives, Ufap/Unsa states, and for those "there is always room in the budget".
It's just a scandal, an interregional FO Union in Marseille announced its decision to block "all meetings and calls".
Workers will not come to work on Sunday or on holidays, if they will not be paid for these days from October to October in December, as in the past, they are also at risk of FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are being given more work and more jobs without having other staff available to us, it is sad to allow them to pay for this job to the lowest level of employees, says CGT prison supervisors in Bordeaux.
According to the committees, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better than others.
However, in each case of financial resources because there is little, General Ufap, Jean-François Forget, found.
They both claim that they give "best gifts" at Christmas than are those who get it.
American President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, believed Oprah Winfrey's "Godny" drawings, that regarding gifts, has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than those I get."
The president and his wife, Michelle, spoke in a special edition of the order that will be sent on Sunday evening to the ABC station about how they are going to spend the holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious apartment.
Even I Bo, a small four - year - old family partner will get their own way.
Jesus likes Boa too, said Michelle Obama, with the dog 'of course' also getting a gift as it comes from the results of the pre-order.
And Michelle Obama was also opposed to her husband's claims on the quality of gifts she receives: "That's certainly not so, I gave you a prize present," said the president.
Well, of course it's true, he was forced to agree with the president, but immediately he showed his finger to the first lady's hairdresser: "And who gave you this?"
In this one-yearly, very relaxed order with the famous modator who actively supported Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, Obama's husband also talked about their favorite gifts that they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a train with a 10-degree transfer, but also a basketball match that he was awarded at his father's wedding, which he met only very rarely.
I remember seeing my father, who came to see us at the festival and gave me that basketball game, the president said.
It's been a long time since I realized that the sword actually gave me it.
The first lady mentioned again at the girl's house.
I didn't even know how I had everything in my home to organize, so I took all the furniture off the wall instead of putting it around his chest, but I loved that little house for girls, remember Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reopened, RTL says he's in an art bed
Johnny Hallyday was reopened in Los Angeles because of the " wound" resulting from major operations in France, but according to his closest "control", while the RTL station indicated that the song is in an art bed to prevent pain and complications.
66th-year-old rocker was reopened on Wednesday at the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors found "the injury resulting from the operation" of an explosive plane which he carried out in Paris on November 26, he told his press department in Paris that these beds required "the proper operation".
However, the section of the song tried to calm the public and indicated that the situation was "under control" and at the same time announced that a new medical communication would be issued within 48 hours.
According to the RTL station, which is the main partner of the last tour singer, Johnny Hallyday was placed in an art bed to prevent "sickness and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens our eyes, we'll have a little more security, RTL.
The press department did not confirm or comment on AFP's question.
The RTL also states that according to "some sources" there was no damage after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was employed at the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of an intrusion.
The surgery that was planned a few days ago was carried out by neurosurgery by Stefan Delajoux, a well-known doctor in art circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday for information on RTL.
After this operation, the singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles for infection that occurred after infection.
The song of Eddie Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallydaye, said on Thursday on RTL's radio that his friend is going through "bad times", but he added that he's about rocker "don't care," because it's a big "warman".
He called me a while before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was making a fool, because spending 12 hours at the airport after such an operation is no joke, said Eddie Mitchell.
In the middle of the evening he calmed the situation of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, who said that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well on antibiotics" and that the infection was "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said he met Laeticia, the wife of a singer, and that he had no special concerns.
Health problems are only sung since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his jacket.
Two months later, to the surprise of all, it was discovered that Johnny Hallyday was infected with a "small amount of thin air" and then with a weak infection.
At the end of the meeting, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his divorce.
But since then, every one of his health problems has been closely monitored and commented. Fanous and journalists have noticed that the song has problems with movement on the screen.
In mid-November, his team had to demente the new hospitalization report again.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
Francouz Frédérick Bousquet, a three-year-old medalist on the world's science in 2009 in a large pool, won the title of Europe 2009 in a small pool in Istanbul in discipline, which is particularly popular: 50m free way.
The first day of the mystery that finally allowed the combinations, only three world records fell, although they were expected to be much more.
One of them beat the Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrasztová on 200 m of a semi-final race and two other men's staff of Russia on 4x50 m of a semi-final race.
A large warehouse for Bousquet, which was built on a world record for 50 m free, which is already held in a large pool (20.94).
In one of two royal disciplines, 50m free of charge, he won 28-year-old France with the final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, where the primer started ten sailors instead of ordinary eights.
Bousquet defeated Croatia Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesik (20.84), but was unable to convince him of the world record (20.30), as he predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if there's a world record in my experience, I'll try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all the sailors had combinations made of polyurethane that would be banned from January 1.
From February 2008 to the 238 world records and their era ended in Istanbul, which was the first host in 1999 on the same competition.
The use of combinations this time did not help the Germans Paul Biedermann, the dual master of the world in a large pool in Rome during the summer, which had a world record on hand.
The young sailor was unable to convince the record that holds 400 metres free of charge (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian runner Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Mrs. Mademe Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't give up on that race.
I knew I didn't know the world record this time, but I was able to hold my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious obstacle to the future, explained Biedermann.
U.S.: The Roman sarcophage board belonging to Zolov was issued for US$1.5 million
A table of Roman sarcophagus that belonged to no one other than French writer Emil Zola was issued on Thursday for $1.5 million, which is much more than was estimated, said a businessman with Sotheby's art.
The price of these two meters long and 63 cm high-top boards from the third century of our flight is estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble "presenting four dionysian scenes in the designed architectural decoration, including satires and bacantes is a rare work, similar to the tastes are very small in the world, about four or five," AFP told Florent Heintz, Vice-President of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's.
The work was sold among hundreds of others.
The sale is still going on, but it's the subject that was probably most attached to, the AFP agency told Sotheby's speaker Dan Abernethy.
The fact that Emily Zola arranged this nightmare was discovered a few days ago.
The desk was in Rome for nearly 300 years in the previous collection of the Borgia family and then gradually appeared in the French hierarchical Cecile Sorel, which was excavated with it at its private hotel in Paris and by Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic in France and the President of the Council shortly before the entry into force of the Petina march.
It's been frozen there for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz found in his search for a museum database in Louvru that this board was part of "the remains of Emila Zoly" opened since 1903, the year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresh "Rougon-Macquart".
The attempt to leave President Zelayi from Honduras to Mexico was interrupted.
In the fourth quarter, Mexico indicated that there were no conditions for the transport of the Conciliated President of Honduras, Manuel Zelayi, to whom the contractors refused to grant security clearance.
After a telephone conversation I had with President Zelaya on the night, she always testifies that there is no way to make this transport possible, the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosov, introduced.
The Mexican government aircraft which arrived in the middle of Salvador for President Zelay's departure again introduced the source of the general guide for migration.
The Purchasing Government wanted to bring President Zelay to "demis" and to ask for political asylum abroad, only to provide him with a safe exit.
But the vice president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exil head of state.
The Purifiers' government "have experienced other failures when it wanted me to give up my functions (...), they wanted me to give up," said Zelaya Radio Globo, in the fourth quarter of the year, often expressing itself to the political crisis that has been taking place in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years. I've got my guitar here. I've added a co-chairman who's been hidden in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months. He's been playing some accords.
The Embassy of Mexico has asked us to guarantee safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, said the Interior Minister, Oscar Raul Matete of Honduras HRN.
I'm not going to ask for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya said in his interview for Telesur station, which has a seat in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I'll leave as president of the Honduras people, he'll make a point.
The news of Zelaya's departure was mobilized in the middle of the arrest of the co-chair, who came to gather around Brazil's embassy, where the army had sent for protection.
Brazil's Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticised the position of the Puritan government.
They show their marginal position to international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who approached Venezuelan socialist President Hugo Chávez, was arrested on 28 June on the day he organized his re-election of public consultation and against the recommendation of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Out of exile in Costa Rica he returned unexpectedly on 21st September and found a refuge on the Brazilian Embassy.
If he gets out of here, he'll be arrested and he'll be responsible for the crime of "vereyards", which he's accused of, he says, "pussistic government."
On 29 November, President Roberto Micheletti was given the opportunity to organize presidential elections to replace President Zelayi.
In controversial elections recognised by the United States but judged by Latin America such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil won Porfirio Lobo.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelayi's return to power and until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street wakes up, business balance USA leads to optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday growth and the results of the U.S. business balance testify to rise both in the United States and with its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final findings, Down Jones Industrial Average has improved from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points and Nasdaq points, with technological dominance from 7,13 points to 2190.06 points.
Index Standard & Poor 500 has improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegzo from FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focusing on "half of the full conclusion".
For Peter Cardillo from Avalon Partners, investors focus primarily on the number of US trade balance sheets "which show that the activity improves in the fourth quarter".
The United States' commercial balance sheet was estimated at 7.6% in October at $32.9 billion.
The analysts, however, looked forward to an increase in poverty.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
A large news is the growing volume of trade, particularly exports of goods, reflecting the growth of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell from the research companies Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment was rising against all expectations and the number of job indicators reached 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new employment indicators "to the lowest in this year," said Scott Marcoüller from Wells Fargo Advisors.
The market with precious paper also closed.
The rate of state expenditure for 10 years increased by 3,482% around 3,423% on Tuesday evening and by 30 over the period of 4,492% around 4,408% on the day before.
Cuba : hundreds of residents of the regime published "The White Lady"
Several percent of the Cuban regime's residents were imprisoned in the fourth quarter of the political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day and banned other demonstrations where dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Dam in White", a husband or a close political prisoner was posted directly on the streets of the Raula Castra regime on their way to the center of the capital, with a requirement to release political prisoners, reported the journalist.
Go with Yankees!, "Goldiers!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Let Fidel and Raul live!"
The dissidents were finally escorted by civilians who came to "safety. "
The day before, there was a similar demonstration against "The Lady in White" in Havana, but it didn't come to her for injury or imprisonment.
But in the Havan district of Vedado, police officers were detained in civilian territory about ten dissidents who also wanted to manifest themselves on Thursday at the opportunity of World Day of Human Rights, AFP reported.
According to this journalist, the police imposed dissidents who had been forced into civil vehicles by the government regime.
Imprisonment of dissidents under similar conditions takes only a few hours of rule.
The citizens of the Sachar prices of the European Parliament for 2005, "The White Houses" organized an illegal march for "a release of all, according to their discretion, about 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Mr Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of which 53 remain behind the networks.
The Cuban authorities consider the resistance to "guarantees" or "agents" imposed by their main enemy, the United States.
To the surprise, Cuban television reported on the fourth demonstration of the state-run regime against "revolutionary opponents".
Cuba with the Communist Party in the head and the government's policy is regularly accused by European or American non-governmental organizations of disrespect for human rights and freedom of speech, including freedom of speech.
The knifeman killed an eight-year-old man and wounded 5 people in Clichy-la-Garanne.
A knife gunman killed an eight-year-old man and wounded five other people in the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) during a raid on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, at the age of 28, the attacker reportedly attacked two knives and, for unknown reasons, an 80-year-old man in or before him, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, is a version of the police and witnesses.
A severely wounded old gentleman born in 1929 died under the Alliance police union in the hospital as a result of the injury.
In this medicine or before, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
At about thirty years of age, his husband began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80-year-old man died.
The life of the second injured is at risk, according to police sources, it is evident that vital organs have been infected.
A pregnant woman then collapsed and was transferred to a hospital "in shock," said a police source.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as he introduced a police source, then fled to the street, still at the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He wounded two other people, apparently a man of thirty and forty years, the second seriously.
As it happened, it's not quite clear, because it's all played in the evening hours.
He was armed with two cutting knives that carried the cross behind him, said at the location of the Alliance's leading union at Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Presse.
Several roundabouts, including young people, have tried to stop and play the game according to the testimony of the AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old boy in a green band.
Three young men tried to catch him.
It didn't happen to them because he was quite strong, commented on the situation of Alberto, a cleaning man from a nearby bar.
He paid his taxes, including one of the city's police officers who broke his visa.
Still at Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of 61, two police cities, including their leaders, tried to keep an armed man and were injured by guns, provided a police source.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
They came to tell me that outside is a person who's hurt.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, I put him in a safe place, and I noticed a big wound on my chest, sent AFP agent Frederic Allion, a thirty-five-year-old doctor.
Five minutes later, another person, about thirty-year-old, who also had foot wounds, arrived.
A man who had no evidence of guilt was arrested after the state police.
The national representative of Nanterre presented the matter to the investigating department of the national police at Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect attacker was transferred to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in a relationship and he's waiting for an audience.
The police didn't exclude his position in psychiatric treatment.
Another police source indicated that there was a need for six police officers to manage it at the police station in Clichy, where he was transferred.
He was "all beyond himself" as "all the crazy guys of this kind whose strength in action is increasing tenfold."
U.S.: Polish Lawyer again calls for the end of the criminal strike
The law of Polish-French director Romana Polanski again asked on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to stop the criminal proceedings against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence because of a state-of-the-art affair that occurred thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the legal representative of the director of the film "Pianista" criticised before the three judges of the Appeal Court of the second period in California, a serious error that occurred during the trial in 1977.
I demand that the arrest stop be stopped now and now, the lawyer Hummel introduced it and added that, from the conduct of the judge who was then in charge of the matter, Laurence Rittenbang "had hate in the back."
According to him, the judge (which had already died between that time) was likely to meet with a national representative who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – which is a serious violation of the rule of law.
Information on this conversation was published in the document "Roman Poland: wanted and desired" (Roman Poland, sought and requested), from the mouth of the national representative, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally announced to the end that "false" author's document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop criminal proceedings, Judge Hummel will require a trial to be held, in which he will be able to provide evidence of his claim.
The complainant repeated what had been said in the first state, although no serious study of the application for a cessation of criminal detention will be made until Roman Poland is brought before the court.
76th-year-old director fled from the United States in 1978, before the court ruled on "unlawful sexual intercourse" with an unaccompanied 13-year-old girl.
Since then, he has never entered the land of the United States again.
The prosecutor's representative in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said that Roman Polanski "should be there to take part in the trial".
In this case, we want to show not only Roman Polaski, but also the other regrettory that it is possible to escape? Mrs Asayam asked.
It is the view that the director "demonstrates on the trial and at the same time undermines his authority."
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to make a decision also stressed that there are "other alternatives to exclusion".
Lawyer Hummel wasn't the only one who asked to stop Roman Polanski's criminal arrest.
The victim's legal representative, Samantha Gemer also asked for the end of the criminal arrest.
She said that her client would continue to bear this constant burden every time the Polish case comes up and she added: "No one in this room can say that the process was fair."
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland at the U.S. order
More than two months later, he was released from his home prison in Gstada, where he is waiting for the event.
Wall Street ends with no direction. He's running a dollar.
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without any direction, the market stops between indicators that were better than expected in the United States and rising dollar price: Down Jones won +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final findings, Down Jones Industrial Average extended from 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points and Nasdaq, leaving 0.55 points with technological dominance and finished to 2,190.31 points.
Index Standard & Poor's 500 increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106,41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, Mace Blicksilver brought from Marblehead Asset Management.
It's still in high speed, the volume of trade is very low, and I think it's going to stay until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and which "helped to improve market surveillance in terms of economic recovery stability," analyst Charles Schwab quoted.
In the United States, retail markets grew by 1.3% in November and by the second month after themselves and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index, the U.S. consumer confidence has also returned, and in December it grew to 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indexes were frustrated by a new rise in the price of the dollar against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, which "presses down the sector sensitive to the economic situation," Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank said.
Technological actions are thus losing ground under their feet.
The market with valuable papers closed.
State spending by 10 years increased by 3,540% around 3,482% in the middle of the evening and by 30 years at 4,497% around 4,492% on the day before.
The election of Miss World again in the South African Republic.
After a monthly trip to the South African Republic, 112 candidates on the Miss World's title go beyond the goal of achieving their dream: to be chosen by the most beautiful woman in the world before billions of television fans.
This great celebration of beauty has been taking place in Johannesburg for the second year and five candidates have progressed to the semifinal.

It was real faith in the event.
It was wonderful to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen so many things and I've got so many experiences! Miss Sirry Leon.
The competition which has already taken place in the South African Republic after the ninth is to be sent directly from Midandu, north of Johannesburg, from 17 a.m. (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't figure out the most beautiful country I'd ever set up a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm glad I was able to live it twice. Miss of the world of Xenia Sukkin in the hot winter.
For young Russia, her second residence in the South African Republic took place in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and a new revelation of the country and her "land that expresses the spirit".
After a month of exhibitions, testing, press meetings and safari, the Mission now focuses on its own competition.
Indaka Pooja Chopraova hopes that it will take steps Priyanky Chopraov, elected in 2000, which would also participate in the 1994 Aishwarye Rai, the winners of which became two Bollywood stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is the dream of every woman, but it's not just a vision.
We're out of our country, and I want to go home with the crown, says Miss India with a broad smile.

The candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and of course in swimwear.
The presentation will be presented by the Chinese television modator Angela Chow, the former royal beauty of the South African Republic of Michelle McLean and the president of the Miss of the world of Steve Douglas.

The candidates participated in Safari, visited the famous city of Soweto, this time on the bike, and enjoyed the local kitchen.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them permission.
For an extraordinary president, she met Miss Sierry Leon.
No doubt the most beautiful memory will remain in Cape Town (on the southwestern side of the country) for the World Cup, which will end in June 2010, which has helped the country to support something more.
I could've met people I didn't even dream about.
I'm sure I'll be back at the 2010 World Cup, says with Miss Italy Alice Taticchi's inspiration.
According to David's son, reports of Hallyday's "very positive" attitude.
The news of Johnny Hallyday's status is "very positive" as he assured us of his son David at his fifth visit to the airport in Los Angeles, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong and everything's going very well, David Hallyday announced when he landed from the plane that he flew from Paris after 13 hours of local time (21 hours of world time)
The singer's son, who was calm, announced that "the fastest" will be delivered to the Cedars-Sinaï Los Angeles hospital, where Johny Hallyday was adopted on Monday because of post-operative infections following surgery of broken mesobratal plates which occurred on November 26.
According to the press release, the night in Los Angeles was sung for the reason of "injection into an art bed", which should prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a doctor at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles who had already been admitted to an art bed. The hospital came to hospital for infection after surgery after an outbreak of mesobrotal plaques on 26 November in Paris.
Because of the serious damage caused by this infection , the song must be reopened on the middle of the night on Thursday .
According to AFP photographer, his wife, Laeticia, attended a French school performance in Los Angeles on Friday morning, visiting their daughter Jade.
The department of orthopedic surgery and traumatology of the hospital la Pitié-Salpètriere, Yves Catoné, announced that the song to Los Angeles was due on Monday.
The manufacturer strongly accused Dr. Stéphana Delajouxe, a neurosurgeon who sang on 26 November at Clinique international du park Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
The surgeons from Los Angeles announced they were beaten, Mr. Camus said.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus thinks Johnny Hallyday went too fast to Los Angeles and it's with the permission of his Parisian surgeon."
I spoke to the doctor personally on the phone and he assured me that this trip was no problem, which surprised me a lot, since I had suffered twice as much as I had suffered from mesobrotal seizures.
Some time ago, at the RTL radio station, the singer apparently flew after the Paris operation without any land, no matter what."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in art circles.
He raped the heretic of Mari Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which he was responsible for at that time.
In 2007, he also cured Charlotte Gainsbourg’s liver when he was removed from the bleeding resulting from his brain.
It is also a doctor with a dark reputation, several times judged in cases of neglect of the medical care, for the tax benefits and for the underage.
Lawyer Olivier Metzner called him "a man without a body" who is "regular" before the doctor's room and who can't even "remote".
After a few days of silence Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself on Friday through his lawyer David Koubby.
He announced that he had "just a good time" and the post-operative investigation was "normal".
The operation was not of a haemologic nature, so it was not necessary to introduce the soil," he added.
The health problems of singing have increased since this year, and in any case its next tour seems to remain with the questionnaire.
It is clear that the time limit for the renewal of the planned tournament on January 8th (In Amiens, p.r.) is running too close, Camus announced.
The UDF will raise the tone and call on the New York Centre side to stop using their shorts.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayroua, responded on Friday to the attempt by the President of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morina to grant the shortness of the former Giscard Party, with no short term being used in any media under the threat of criminal arrest.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to own a short UDF with the fact that François Bayrou does not deserve to bear her legacy after giving her hand to the left.
The Defence Minister whose party is a partner with UMP was planning to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step has been supported by Hervé de Charetta (formerly UMP now for NC), who is a member of the UDF's brand because he first allowed it to be registered in the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut de la Proprietété industrialelle).
But on Friday evening, the UDF team of friends managed by Françoise Bayrouu, who are not going to let themselves go out, came out of his silence and gave the formal request of the Minister and the messengers to stop using the short and return the property of the defence marks under the threat of criminal arrest.
In recent days you have raised a disturbing statement that you are proposing your political motivation + to take over the UDF summary, writes the Association in its letter signed 19 or 24 members of the Committee, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis from Alliance Centralist.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and to welcome the website of your touch of the name+New Center+, with a +UDF today+, also find the signatures of the letter.
As you are aware, you do not have any right to use this summary, the UDF Committee, which requests the encouragement of the NC" to remove all the terms of the name of the UDF from all promotional materials, including their (their) websites."
At the same time, Hervé de Charlete asks "to pass the property of protection marks to legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will refer to the courts in order to respect the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, the signatories will warn.
In their letter, UDF "is a full-time political campaign in 1978" and they recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "have chosen" since 2007, "to create a competitive push, as elsewhere in 2002 to establish UMP.
Hnutí New Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF (Union for the French democracy).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and to create a committee responsible for attracting the "moral and material interests" of Valérem Giscardem d'Estaing-based association.
In the case of Hervé de Charlete, the Committee continues "when it registered a security note", not "three years ago as a member of UDF", but UMP.
In a scandalous and subwatering way, he used non-existing acronym registration to do so on his own account.
This uncertainty begins to change into criminal acts, they say, and then ironically they say to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that as in politics and in ordinary life it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to come out of anonymity by adopting a name that we have no right to."
The case of Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will be sentenced to abuse of the status of weakness.
The Court in Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist Françoise-Marie Banier and decide whether he used the status of an 80-year-old billionaire to prepare her for part of her name, from which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt owes her.
The photographer (62 years), known as his famous photographers, will be sentenced to 15 and 16 April 2010 to abuse of the status of weakness, which is a criminal offence for which a maximum penalty of 3 years is imposed and a fine of 375 000 euros.
This Decision confirms that it will actually carry out a process in the cause that can be described as a family story of one of the richest families in France in which mother and daughter are attacked and fighting against the management of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
At the same time, the 15th Criminal Court ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Lilian Bettencourt, who was supposed to conduct a college of three doctors.
Grandfather and chief shareholders of L'Oréal have always refused to carry out such investigations, not subject to the conditions offered by the State representative in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should draw up a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time provide an explanation as to whether Liliana Bettencourt could be found in a state of weakness and during which period.
I think she's gonna hit her.
I'm talking to her about it. After the hearing, he announced to Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiyman.
In the case of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, the Court welcomed that decision.
It's a great story. The expert shows that with this old lady who needs protection, he manipulates (M. Banier).
It was two years ago that the only daughter of Lilian Bettencourt began criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banieror, photographers and artists who, for years, blamed her mother for using the status of her mother's weakness to obtain a grant of billions of euros in the form of checks, a life insurance contract or a master's image.
That's why Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be a photographer who thinks of as a long-term friend.
While the court had to challenge Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers' right to appeal, the fifth sentence of lawyers changed from time to time in the family time of the truth.
Lilian Bettencourt’s lawyer submitted three letters to his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) expressing his mistrust of his wife François Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt, according to a lawyer, adds: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote Banier for fifteen years once or twice a day.
Ever since I married Françoise, I've never been able to talk to her."
The State representative of Nanterre once again found that the complainants were not entitled to conduct proceedings, more than that the defence judge had rejected her application to initiate proceedings for legal protection for her mother in those days.
Liliane Bettencourt is fully capable of participating in the court, not under protection or protection.
No one else will deal with her," confirmed the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers would express itself at the time of the initiation of the proceedings.
The managerial revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for economic intelligence has been crucial...
For more than ten years, it has been reminded of the management of large companies with regard to employees' access to companies against consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about the fact that employees are concerned with the "values" of the mountain, as was previously the case when they had to use products derived from the ideas of factory technicians.
By becoming the center of business companies, the marketing revolution compared the market strategy to the right direction... and when the authoritarian efforts to include products other than customer preferences are regularly returned!
Passive access of employees can lead to fatal demolition.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault companies are only a visible part of a much broader general phenomenon that is mainly involved in managerial frameworks.
This demobilisation has a irrevocable impact on the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and what is more important, economic intelligence.
In fact, the EI "needs active access and predictability from all parties involved" and requires employees of obligations that are totally in line with the revenue of the authoritarian management.
We therefore call for the managerial revolution, which should aim at putting workers at the centre of business interest as a client.
Relative utility of internal research of public opinion.
Internal research of public opinion - as a questionnaire submitted by Orange's employees - contribute to the revolution in managerial procedures?
I'm sorry I'm afraid there's no one.
The main reason I've already convinced myself that she's faced with a new situation is that the structure after different divisions will come back primarily to... what she's always been doing!
Furthermore, the authority, as one of the pathology of power, is gradually increasing the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most executives have a simple view of human behavior.
Because they're graduates of high school for engineers, they have mechanical interpretations of psychology.
Because of mental satisfaction, they win the old beheha-yoristic theory, currently re-resurrected "new neurosciences" from the United States, and widely spread without any greater knowledge of scientific statutes and the media.
Since it is possible to move "packs" (sic) to join managers, he has shown a recent investigation by the Ipsos agency on the Figaro.fr pages, which only establishes management staff in their position of mechanical management that is not suitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobility factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution is necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses, presuming the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It begins with the inclusion of the basic market into all purposes and practice of the procedure: for employees, obligations against the company will be possible only if they are used as a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At the present time, this concept of motivation of employees is only a study of motivational functional analysis.
These studies showed that the assessment of their companies on the basis of a particular dossier that enables them to assess what they are offering them to achieve their life goals by means of an image that tells them about the undertaking.
By identifying and measuring these mobility factors, management staff can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their management of human resources "on the right path".
This creates a living environment for the development of sound and effective economic intelligence.
Osla's revelation: "just war" has served Obama's praise for his rights.
American law on Friday welcomed the demonstration that Barack Obama presented the day before in Oslo, calmed by the fact that the Nobel Peacekeeper for 2009 had challenged the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who were first criticized for awarding Obama's price on 9 October, this time the presidential demonstration, including Sarah Palin's former candidates for the Vice-President's election in 2008.
I liked what Palin said, the museum of the right Republican wing, for the U.S. Today, and she added that she herself had expressed herself on this subject "sometimes necessary" war in her memories that are just coming out.
The ball is of course the last thing the Americans would like to get to work, but it's necessary.
All terrorists need to stay there, he thinks.
President Obama, who fought two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor George W. Bush, on Thursday in Oslo, justified the sending of forces and used the demonstration to explain his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days ago.
Next Obama's opponent, Newt Gingrich, agreed that the president took "very good work" to Oslo.
I think that the demonstration was really very good, welcomed by the former President of the Snow House, who assessed, in particular, the President's terms of "the existence of evil in the world".
In my own way, I considered this demonstration to be quite historical, declared Gingrich during the conversation on the "The Takeway" radio series.
The former Ambassador, whom some consider to be a potential Republican candidate in presidential elections in 2012, was forced to see "the Left President" remind members of the Nobel Prize Committee that they would not be free and could not submit a price for peace if there was no force".
According to Michael Gerson, former director of George W. Bush's show, now editor Washington Post, Obama introduced "very American show".
Not only did he present himself as "worldly" as always, but "talked as an American president" and reminded Europeans that they live in a safe bubble that they didn't create themselves and that they don't do too much to keep it," Gerson agreed.
Among the few minors of a number of rights are the Bush eras, an ex-emphasis at the UN John Bolton, which marked the demonstration as "single, inspired and without inspiration", as he pointed out on the National Review Online website .
Left of the president, for example, democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is afraid of Barack Obama’s justification for using force.
"When we put war in the balance of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the medium-to-left press remains against the President's commendable position.
Although Los Angeles Times continues to consider the award of Obama's peace price as early as possible, he has considered his performance to be "a superfluous" and even for the speaker of his famous talent.
Osla's appearance should serve as a guide to international decisions in resolving conflicts, in the fight against poverty and oppression," said the California daily.
Both "provided what was necessary", agreed New York Times, and marked "for a simple and educational" event.
Road transporters: three maratons to an agreement that preserves the supply of resources on Christmas.
Following three uniform marathons, the road transport and TLF teams, the only organisation of employees that remained until the end of Friday evening, concluded an agreement that ended the call for stand and threat that exceeded the supply of resources for the holiday.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, in his fifth signature of the agreement, expressed "joy" after several talks that began in the middle of the morning.
After the second night of the debate, the MEPs broke up early Friday morning with the hope that the amendment of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible by the end of the next morning.
And this is despite the fact that three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have resigned from the meeting.
But there was a need for more than six hours of meetings that started in 11 hours to all agree and sign the agreement within 18 hours.
This conflict "would hurt businesses very much" and "the danger of breaking the holidays at the end of the year" said Bussereau.
The change in the text includes an increase of 4% in the lowest fees (in local and regional transport) and 2.9% in the highest fees (in international transport).
The hour limit for the minimum fees shall be increased from €8.72 to €9.06.
It's not much, but it's too much effort, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight we are ordering our members not to come to the blockades, no blockades of the start-up centres.
But there may be a few more rehabs that aren't calm," he added.
Philippe Grillot, President TLF, welcomed "the legal agreement" even though it was difficult to recognise the increase in high fees in view of international competition.
According to him it is estimated to increase by EUR 170 per month in the lowest levels and by EUR 100 to 120 in the highest rates.
With regard to the agreement on sound understanding and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) declared, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jauberta (CGT), this is a "friendly compromise".
The agreement also proposes a revalorisation of travel costs of 3% and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow for a focus on the issue of payment of the 13th fee and modernization of the collective contract.
Busssereau recalled "a reduction of EUR 100 million on corporate taxes" which was the subject of an amendment to the Government's proposal for a 2009 budget bill, which was voted on Thursday to Friday at the National Assembly.
The government is calling for the Senate to vote "conformally".
The signature enables this agreement to be applied first to companies which are members of this organisation, later on to the entire committee, in case of expansion by the Ministry of Labour.
It's actually "in the shortest term," Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only be interrupted by a lack of agreement from employers' organisations.
The FNTR organisation speaks of "bad trade" because EUR 100 million has already been offered under the compensation of part of the carbon tax.
The State Secretary for Transport has led us to the emergency treatment of no one because of each other's analysis, but so that he does not know how to eat the bread in the time of the upcoming Christmas holidays, he complained about Unostra.
For other organisations, it is dangerous that the agreement in the next 12 months "recovers a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the area".
RER A trains: interruption of transport on the weekend, committees not satisfied with the proposal of the RATP transport company.
The interruption of transport on the RER A direct train line, which is the largest urban mass transport line in France, will continue during the weekend because the fifth meeting between the commissions and the conduct of RATP on the second day of the stage did not lead to any concrete results in the claim for the premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, on the days of the important shopping week before Christmas, trains will only drive between 10 and 20 hours, on the main route (between La Defence and Nation) every second train, except one train from four.
The SNCF proposal will be interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
Business houses Galeries Lafayette, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP has tried to secure connections with large business houses".
Link RER A leads from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The preserved RATP is from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre do Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train with two and practically no repair took place outside the mirror as it was in the plan.
Like Ile de France's residents were ordered on Thursday, and he didn't control the garbage on the premises.
So early in the morning there was much less people than usual in Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station than there were, among other things, because of the lack of pupils and students.
Jack Nkakina, engineer, 29 years from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he rose about "the hour and half past to make sure he's coming in time".
The Saint-Lazare airport was not filled, the SNCF State Railway announced that there were still more facilities and guards.
The direct RER A trains carried out by SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut have either entered or departed from the St.-Lazare station with access to the metro.
Other ongoing meetings will be held on Saturday and Sunday, at which the results of the fifth afternoon meeting will be assessed by the committees as "weak".
The RER management proposes an agreement on a special protocol for the direct train RER and on all pages, working time adjustment, career transition etc.
However, this is not the case with drivers who require a deserved premium, according to Thierry Garona (Committee).
The RATP even put forward proposals for the premium, which led to the CGT's failure to "have been able to solve the problem while in road transport and SNCF it has been".
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, "closer examination of the conditions of enforcement of the call", RATP explained.
Which was the reason why the committee thinks it's a business that's "making out of weekend travel toys".
In the following hours about 150 drivers had a business committee in its Paris seat.
The conduct which had previously rejected any discussion during the stage was therefore decided in the interest of "reliance" for the meeting.
It is dangerous that the conflict will spread in the morning on the RER B line, after Unsa and Independent will notify the state of readiness.
The Committees apply for a premium of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros change (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Jeh), Independents (Independence)) and make themselves difficult for the deteriorating working conditions on this line that transport millions of passengers daily.
Direct RER train drivers perform careers 2200 to 2700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros premiums for irregular working hours and work on Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice has left behind the Kurdish side and this decision has had serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on the annulment of the main pro-Curdian party in the country on Friday. This decision immediately called for a protest in demonstration in the Kurdish community in the south-east country and in Istanbul.
This decision can be very complicated by the tasks of governments that are trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and thus try to end 25 years of conflict.
The party to the Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it became "the enemy of the activities of the threat of State independence and its undistributed entities," President Hasim Kilic told journalists after four days of meeting.
The decision was adopted unanimously by 11 judges when a majority of seven votes were required for the resolution of the party, Kilič added that 37 pages, including her President Ahmet Turkey and Ambassador Aysely Tuglukovi, had a ban on taking part in political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the annulment of the parliamentary immunity which Mr. Turk and Mrs. Tugluk and the confiscation of property of the party to the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP party has 21 seats in Parliament (from 500).
The management of the party had already warned before the verdict that the Members would prefer to leave Parliament rather than act as envoys without political jurisdiction.
The decision is to continue the process initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalcinka, who accuses DTP of being obedient to "orders" of Kurdistan (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider to be a terrorist organization.
Many observers are convinced that DTP is a legal political rival of the PKK rebels.
The party ensures that there is no "foundation" connection with the PKK, but refuses to mark it for a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to deal with it.
The Court's verdict will come at a time when the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and tries to limit Kurd's support against the PKK and thus end the conflict.
The DTP ruling confirmed that the release of the party could lead to the renewal of pressure on the southeastern Anatolia, where in recent weeks there has been a lot of demonstrations against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan has been detained.
Since the declaration of justice, thousands of demonstrators have been gathered before the DTP settlement in Diyarbakir, a large city in the south-east, mostly Kurds.
The police used dirty grenades and waterworks, the demonstrators used Molotov's cocktails again or shot stones out of their hands.
Also in Istanbul, there were about a hundred people.
After the award was made, Mr Turk pointed out that the decision of justice was only "inexhaustible".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdó, p.r.) by order of the party, declared in press.
The government, created by a party, has also condemned this decision.
We're from the principle of anti-fraud.
It's okay, Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is simply a reflection of the democratic proposals launched by the government by politician Ahmet Island.
Understandably, we can wait for the PKK response, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK joined one of the most deadly attacks in northern Turkey, which killed three days ago seven soldiers.
Snow can come in
It's a nice freezing winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger's going through.
Not because he wants to scare citizens, he says the director of the winter department of the FES technical services.
But for his employees to be able to test and learn to control all driving techniques.
This weekend might be the first time that meteorologists can come to it.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are prepared to take care of snow and ice.
The EES shall, however, act in accordance with the specific plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt completely and the heat falls under zero, 20 so-called A giants will go out, Brauburger explains.
Among these tasks are main and transit routes such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also the arrivals for the lifts, the lines of direct public transport, speeds up areas and cuts with closures like Atselbergstraße.
The FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning.
In the event of need, it is necessary for a maximum of three hours to be filled with a soft salt that is better to hold something about 1040 kilometres.
Therefore, the FES starts in three hours a night, "to be free when the transport to employment is started".
It's not easy when it starts snowing first at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the director of the winter department of technical services, 'because no one's willing to do the laundry.'
As soon as it does not so snow, there are a number of coming and encouraging communications, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority has side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they'll be there to complain.
At five o'clock in the morning, FES is on its way, particularly dangerous places and crossings.
The FES cannot generally care for all cyclosthetics.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, followed by 22 to 4.30 bridges, says Brauburger.
Since they are made fast ice cream, they eat soda as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
If necessary, they are also called by the police.
Dinosaurs coléb
Tawa hallae seemed like a lot of other massage dinosaurs: The animals were two meters long and 1.50 meters high after two strong rear ends, had a deep lip with sharp, stuck teeth, short front ends with sharp holes and long tails.
If this kind lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the fourth edition of Science magazine wrote that Tawa hallae was but one of the first dinosaurs with these physical signs.
The animal lived some 215 million years ago in New Mexico today, which was then located in the same dry area of the Pangea supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window to the previous evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It tells us much about the historical relationships, expansion and significant early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging in Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes one day we found thousands of dinosaur bones, which is unknown for three-year-old inventions, informs a member of Randall Irmis team from the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the burial, the rest were collected with all five units.
The research confirms the theory of early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the Sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitta it's unusual to find: "The three-star dinosaur fossils are very rare, most of them only find individual compartments."
The other experts on dinosaurs do not share this excitement without reward.
In particular, this sensory find is not found, but confirms some theory of the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific observation, dinosaurs first appeared before the collapse of 230 million years.
The composition of the oldest fossils is not complete, so most of them are controversial.
Experts are discussing, for example, the three most important development lines: the macrosurgery of the teropods that later belonged to Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor and also birds, the "long-range" four sauropods and their natives, and the Ornithischia (ptacopian), which belonged to the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa Hallae is an analysis of Nesbitta and his colleagues' original therapist.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On Tawa hallae, researchers have found evidence of air waves that also have descendants of birds of theropods.
Due to air currents, breathing birds is more effective than hunters.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of five were obviously filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive therapist with air age, says Randall Irmis.
Since the attractive line of large sauropods later also had airtime and light bones, this useful innovation has probably already created a common front for both groups.
At least three migration waves into North America
Since the most primitive dinosaurs have ever lived in South America, scientists have been exporting that the lakes first appeared there.
According to this, three development lines were broken up very soon and extended from South America to all continents, which were then formed by a single country mass as a supercontinent of Pangea.
She would also talk about the fact that the team found two others left with Tawa Hallae, not particularly a few friendly therapists.
These three cannot come from one of the common, hosted ancestors, argue scientists.
We believe it has reached at least three migration waves into North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of scientific study.
Of course, there are also differences.
Another older species, Silesaurus, a group of the most difficult dinosaurs, has lived in Poland today, says bono paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could give together a well-defined picture, because in South America there are still very many primitive fossils of dinosaurs that are rarely found on other continents.
As the dinosaurs have shown, the relatively rare path of the plasma species has developed to rule over the land during the time of the earthquake.
During the trias the dinosaurs shared their living space with many other beaches, such as today's crocodiles and flying lakes and countless other lakes.
At the end of the trias, dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while visitors died and spread trios and juries.
History of success did not last forever
There are two hypotheses that explain this change, says Martin Sander.
It could have come to a mass measurement that the dinosaurs have passed through, but the beach isn't.
Or the dinosaurs were better suited, so they could push the competition.
History of success didn't last forever at all.
Some 150 million years later, he helped another group of animals develop into trias and live from that time on the scene: hunters.
Solidarita from Vidá by São Paulo
The list is long and the signatures are international.
The list includes professors of the University of Toronto, University of Cambridge, Universities of Vision or Berkeley in California.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, São Paulo, Berlin or Brem joined.
The police release of the French University of Goethe's busy casino was about global traffic.
278 professors and students at Goeth University, but also high schools throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarity with protesting students at Westend campus.
In a statement written by German and English, the president 'no' of the police station.
Because the walls and works of art were paved, university president Werner Müller-Estler allowed the building to be cleaned up, which included standing students and lecturers last week.
At the same time, five students were injured.
The damage to things, the judges of the signatories, do not justify "violent resolution of self-organised student and police command".
The exclusion represents "unacceptable principle" for freedom of research and science.
The public focus on vandalism serves as "inadjustment and criminalization of the protest" and draws attention to its content.
The Bureau abstained from the necessary discussion.
The prosecutors call for the suspension of the criminal proceedings.
It is claimed that most of the constants did not support permanent damage.
Right-wing protest
The young committee organisation Verdi and the German committee are also solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern about its own future, says secret German youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hessen Ministry of Science, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), is currently continuing the process of university president and police.
We are grateful to the university president.
The destruction and containment were simply unacceptable means, she said on Thursday at Actuellen Stunde (Current Hour) in Wiesbaden's country film.
We have understanding of the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, said the country's ambassador to CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, we've seen the opposition groups SPD, the Greens and the Linkes.
The CDU took a demeaned look to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of avoiding arguments and demands from students, it came to an end.
Linke made a proposal calling for the Minister to deliver a report on the police situation.
New Silicon-Valley
For years, it paid for a secret town, not available for Western visitors.
Zenograd, one of Moscow's ten-time capitals, in the Soviet Union, was a closely guarded location where secret arms research was carried out.
Today this period of 216,000 inhabitants is considered to be 37 kilometers from the Moscow centre for the Russian Silicon Valley.
Important micro and nanoelectronic research and production centres are located here.
Since September 2008, Green City's representatives have been contacting the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg - with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Centre for Innovation (FIZ).
A number of mutual visits were made and between Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Protocol on Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation led Moscow's Vice-President Jurij Rosljak and a prefect from Zelenograd, Anatoly Smirnov, signed for Frankfurt the head of the planning director Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will be attending a seminar in Zelengrad.
Scientific change
It's about a transient scientific exchange.
But it's also about economic relations.
The FIZ company will be able to join the growing Russian market.
Russian scientific firms, on the other hand, want to obtain orders in Germany.
Zenograd is a seat of important Russian research institutions and companies.
Among them is the Moscow Constitution of Electronic Technologies, the great series of Sitronics and Russia Electronics.
The period was established in 1958 as a so-called "Socialistic Planned City" for arms research.
Zenograd (the literal translation "Green City") received its name according to the country in which the research facilities are established.
Stuttgart Bridge
Dimenze Stuttgart 21 is not ready enough.
For project designers, it's quite simple about "new heart Europe".
All right. S21 is more than the fall of the building, more than the monstrosity building, which will set up the main city of Badenska-Württemberg for a decade into the reliable building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born in the '80s.
The main railway stations that ended in the center of the city were then considered to be transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which were due to the noise of modern rail transport because it took a lot of time to move the trucks forward.
Hold on, hold on, move on, so it should work.
And that's why he's lost his head in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit facility, which lies half-way between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - is therefore the slogan on "European hearts".
It actually starts with S21, although the 80's vision is no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious projectors themselves recognized that in the Hesen and Bavarian countryside construction is almost unfinanced.
Since the existence of modern passenger trains with motor vehicles and driving vehicles at both ends, there has been no problems with driving and driving.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE routes to Ulma.
They've been through land and municipal politics.
Roads cooperate because the risk of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic is taxable rather than state-owned.
The project can be urbanized in some other way.
A new urban area will arise which - if we believe in computer images of designers - will contain a lot of greens.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
Traveling facilities and road construction are intended for personal transport, which - typically in the 1980s - has contributed to considerable growth.
There was no competition for cheap years.
Modern transport policies have to go, however, in the first series of freight transport reinforcements because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than freight cars on the road.
But the new route is not suitable for freight trains because of the wise move.
Even more serious is that S21 does not directly affect the number of other railway projects.
It was supposed to cost six billion euros in Sweden.
It's an official number.
Experts consider the real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade, there will be a lack of funding on the other border points and narrow places in the network.
There are seventy more projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important things is the construction of a 180-mile bridge along the Rhine.
Since 1987 this path has been set at a slow pace.
There'd be a lot of pressure here.
But S21 will be like a bridge.
The road along the Rhine will become a bridge of international freight transport: directly in the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the airport judgment
The Land Government has opened the Wiesbaden Landmark if it is against the ruling of the Hessen Court of Justice (VGH) on the prohibition of nightly flights and allows it to be reviewed.
The Coalition CDU/FDP entrusted experts with the legal case of more than 400 VGH, said the Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH in Kassela today had written reasons that the state would have to reimburse the night ban on flights in the case of construction planned for the northwestern coast of Frankfurt airport.
The 17-year-old permit between 23 and 5 hours, as proposed by the Land Government, does not comply with the law on the protection of citizens from night air traffic.
The Coalition shall be decided by 4 January if it is required to review the judgment.
The opposition criticised this resignation and came to the representatives of the government to issue a review of the Federal Court of Justice in Lipska.
The Chief of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gübel called CDU and FDP to return to the promises regarding the prohibition of nighttime years before the election. Otherwise it is possible to consider it as "the breach of the word".
It's so hard, if you can keep your word, said the Chief of Green Tarek Al-Wazir in a statement on the FDP voter slogan "We keep the word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümpa's training, the country government is trying to get to its nightly flights through "the crossing of rights and tricks".
The precise legal control needs its time.
Coalition doesn't want to work on the basis of "fast first opinion".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The products of his team for the night flight ban were never the same as the opposition.
American banks paying for aid
America, the crisis of broken big banks is free of state roads.
The Bank of America paid the average aid from the Tarp bank savings fund at a total of $45 billion (about EUR 30 billion).
According to the report of the U.S. station CNBC, State aid is also planned to be granted by Citigroup.
The constitutions want to be free from the restrictions that have come to receive money - the restrictions on the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America has provided investors with an exchangeable bond of well 19 billion dollars of clean money.
The rest of the shares were taken out of their warehouses which were filled out by other sales of the committee.
The chief of the bank, Kenneth Lewis, expressed his thanks to the American taxpayer in the middle of the night: The money injection helped us get through a difficult time.
The money institution suffered a high financial crisis by taking over the investment bank of Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup wants to be freed from its obligations to the State by also providing money on the capital market.
With reference to the resources, the CNBC informed that this US bank could already announce its capital increase of around 20 billion dollars on Thursday.
The speaker Citigroup didn't want to say anything about it.
In June they paid for aid already Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick choice
It just happened faster than expected.
The station presented only two weeks after the board of directors of the ZDF was released from the Office of Chief Editor Nicholas Brender.
Last night, the greme wanted to agree with those people.
Peter Frey was appointed to be the lead student of the ZDF study in the main city of Berlin.
But the station didn't confirm it - officially so she didn't run the process.
But Rolli could also play because they didn't want to harm the intentional ZDF Markus Schächter if this proposal did not go to the Governing Council.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs support from nine of the 14 grams.
The result of the vote was unknown before the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago he spent two weeks in the Schächter Governing Council with his proposal to extend his contract with Nikolaus Brender for the next five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven against him. Brander's loss of mission was a hot defeat for Schächter, although it was expected.
The majority of the Union members of the Governing Council had already signaled a few weeks before the elections that they did not want to confirm Brender in the office.
Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch organized a defense against the Chief Editor.
He refused further service in the Office of the Highly Qualified Chief of Staff by arguing that Brender had closed the monitoring quotas for ZDF.
Until shortly before the elections, there were protests which strongly criticised the political impact on the ZDF.
Finally, even 35 state lawmakers, who Kokhov's process is regarded as anti-constitutional, were involved in the debate.
It wasn't for anything.
About
Peter Frey was born on July 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogical and romanticism.
Pak worked for South West Funk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to "heate-journal".
Next station: 1988 to 1990 the personal rapporteur of the Chief Editor; 1991/92 writer in Washington; lead and moderator "Morgenmagazins" until 1998; lead foreign policy ZDF; from that time leading the main study of the ZDF.
After Brender, who was elected in the middle of a special press paper Media Magazine year, sat down, informed Greens that they were making a constitutional application.
Kokhov's pro-indication in the Governing Council, Foreign-Falcian Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the joint country should change the state agreement with the ZDF so that the staff proposals of the intention cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck also refused to exclude foreign policies from the ZDF Board of Supervisors.
Brender's predicted move by Peter Frey, the board of directors handed over a smart chess team - immediately after Brender's meeting, he strongly criticised it.
As a result of this evidence of press independence, he could be appointed as the chief editor without losing his face as Schächter, so he could be liked by the board of directors without suspecting that the party was being pushed into the office.
In the site architecture, Frey is a free line for left liberals.
The study is free of harmabad
Partly success for students: After graduation they finally joined the Minister of Culture on Thursday: At the conference of the Ministers of Culture and High School Rectors, both sides agreed that it is willing to improve the study conditions for the balarians and teachers.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden of trials: Basically, each study module should end with one test.
In addition, the working difficulties of students should be checked and "real and attractive peace" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and high schools want to simplify the recognition of the experience between high schools in Germany and abroad.
The partner countries commit themselves to creating a more flexible common structural task for balarian and Hungarian study teams.
The Earth's differences should cease to exist.
Less Test
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the ministers of culture and university directors have had their own words on better study.
Now they're first filled with a specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Council has concluded that the number of tests in the section is reduced dramatically: "Every module will only be completed by one test", says a 30-page report, which has a new regulatory part of the approval of the study committees.
"A very low test burden," said the Accreditation Council of Reinhold Grimm, should be "a stop to wrong development which has severely limited the scope of the study."
To that end, there must be "study" in the future "distinguishing criteria" in implementation.
Modules and content "must be strictly checked" so that "mostly not limit students to the choice
Seminars."
The students should be "a step towards space which enables and supports their own initiative".
The rules shall be paid for the approval of new study teams after examination but also for existing study teams.
You need to "re Accredit" every five years – which means that it will last until 2015 before all study teams are checked.
It is the responsibility of ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany, which are subject to the accreditation councils by the joint countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture called on the partner country "very" to act on agencies so that the whole of the teaching was not too large and the test regime was not strict.
In individual partner countries, universities and high schools have already agreed with the local ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country has so far pledged additional resources for further development of the Bolonian process.
With money, high schools should in particular build consultation programmes and study councils and strengthen experimental and foreign authorities.
The countries and high schools want to invest 10 million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, he wants to give Parliament a new high school law.
According to it, only one test should be required to complete the study module.
The training of students should be even more flexible, to be guaranteed recognition of tests from other high schools and to facilitate access to teachers.
By the end of the following year, the order of all the study committees in the country should be reviewed.
The government and opposition again agreed on the study conditions in the country on Thursday.
According to the report, there was also criticism of arrest.
The Society's presentation of Juso's high-school groups has called for the creation of education policy to be not played in the future "with closed doors" of ministers and high-school directors.
At the latest, students should also be "spoken at least by word" as the person concerned.
Future academics also received support from the president of the High School Rectors Conference (HRK), Margaret Wintermantel, "We need students' experience", said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministry of Culture, which HRK was discussing on the joint reform report.
According to the Committees of Education and Science (GEW), there has not been a sufficiently far-reaching bonnaise: they require a legal advantage which would allow every student with a balarian title to access the construction master's studio.
Second, the partner country must ensure that, for today's generation of students of the Balearic Committees, enough space is available in the master's study areas with the best study conditions, said the GEW member Andreas Keller.
The partner countries must employ far more suppliers.
The ministers of culture, however, did not express themselves to free access to Master's programmes.
More than a note under the spell to Hert Müller's
Getting to Germany and out is nice because there is no control..." says the initial order of one thorough bassist Werner Söllner, who in this highlighted language taste is the subject of the experience of accessing a dissident who has gained freedom, at the same time came about his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Romanian Banát, worked first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in one of the children's books, and then moved to Frankfurt over Mohan in 1982.
Söllner was awarded various literary prices, in 1993 he presented poetry at the legendary French University of Goethe, and has been the leader of the Hesen literature forum in Moussonturm in Frankfurt since 2002.
A significant munition was provided last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which included "German literature in Romania in a sealed and broken document of its security acts".
Apparently, Söllner, a missing and injured person, has left a statement in which Romanian writers, M. Richard Wagner, William Totoek, Franz Hodjak and Helmutham Frauendorfer have been admitted to cooperation as a secret informant of the Romanian Secret Service Security.
Söllner, together with some of those present, received a German language price in 1989.
In 1971, trials of mining began indiscriminately.
I went on to Söllner, "Then someone who didn't protect himself enough from security threats."
Agent Werner Söllner's secret agent Walter.
At the same time, with the award of the Nobel Prize for Hert Müller and its unambiguous literary arrangement with the dictatorial government mechanisms, the literary scene is a literary scene, and in particular the German community of authors coming from Romania, the case is highlighted by the depth and complexity of the political system, which is based on control and inspection.
Werner Söllner isn't, at least if it can be said according to the traditional state of knowledge, only the healer, but it's also the victim.
In the Security Act, the secret agent Walter played some role, said after Söllner's confession Michael Markel and pointed to the positive effect of the secret agent Walter had on himself.
"He's been waiting for me" then in all the essential points for him, says Markel.
It has a moral obligation to make this note.
Søllner's statement was this way and before this publication, however, it is not surprising to recognize the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Herta Müller wrote already in July, when she read her own document, 914 pages that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the Spices Security.
The touch, it can be assumed, will be speculative and in some cases, and probably know what name is hidden behind the cover of the name Sorin, Voic and even Walter.
Unlike in the Turkish, while I'm very sure to look at the Stasi component, handling with the rest of the Security controls is still very diffusive.
In recent years, the systematic world has been tired and limited.
One of the Birthler's authorities, which is responsible for the processing of Security Components (CNSAS), was established only in 1999 and has been in a more favourable position since then.
There has been a law governing the management of the complex since 2005.
The fact that former members of Security are still having a significant impact in Romania, after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Hert Müller, one of the former Chiefs of Security from Temesvár said that he had rejected the award.
He's got a psychosis. He's got an end result. He's only been released once.
The explosion of power has appeared completely uncovered in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, in the case of Söllner, as in the case of a hidden trial, there are unexplainable questions.
The special reaction of the audience to Søllner's confession is to be expected to determine that the continuation of this chapter will be more slow after knowledge and study.
To the genius of Herty Müller's work, which took Nobel's price yesterday, is more than a mark under magic.
Born stock of Champions League
It looked like a purely dressed commercial representative from a cute dinner party on which the producer of the sport goods of sweetness was divided by four hours after midnight into the approved category C new trainer VfBr Christian Gross in the production of an orange-coloured sponsor box.
A man with a brand-new dance was allowed to drive after him while he was out of town.
Otherwise he could drive himself--alcohol wasn't in the game, and drunk luckily he was a 55-year-old man too.
It was a nice evening, but tomorrow he'll be back to work.
Or it'll just start.
The words just three days of an engaged Switzerland: "We have reached the end of the year", which in the Champions League thanks to victory3:1 over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves lose success: it will be a brutal struggle against composition."
"A far more important task" is ahead of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance in Mohuchi from the royal class and on the ordinary sick day.
And replace the three fast-paced weaknesses of Mary (5), Trésche (8) and Porebnya (11).
Decommissioning
The Osmiffinále Champions League (extreme 16./17. + 23./24 ounces/response 9./10. + 16/17 March) will be dissolved in Nyonu on 18 December.
The joy of Babel’s campaign of conquest will then be preserved.
Not only in a mental doctor who has not been sure about the Stuttgarts professionals but also in a short period of self-consciousness, a desire to find out and enjoy the game.
I went to the players and I told them that they were going to focus on their strong pages and I offered them to be more modest, explained the healer of Gross's soul so simply changing the successful recipe that he didn't have any effect on Babbel therapy.
"When a new impulse comes in the football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't consider possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a multi-day break-up caused by injury, became his dynamics immediately by the best player in the game, tried to describe the "fenomen" found with the title "purple wind" and the working procedures of a new superior: "He is a man who is radical and requires discipline.
That's what we need in the present situation."
It was obviously a mistake for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not saved yet, warns sports president Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs more endurance.
Like Gross, neither players nor managers want to overestimate the victory against the weakened rewards and simply overburdened defences of the Romanian host.
They'd win in Glasgow before the terrible shock came after the defeat of 0:4 in Leverkusen, Khedira thinks.
And sports president Horst Heldt reminded us that one goal has been achieved in the season, the other one is still far away.
We're not in the water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after the first home victory after three months, was caused by weekend events that were quite alive in the form of a television conversation with banker Jens Lehman just before the start of the game.
They're decisions that work differently than Jens, Heldt responded to Lehman's firm criticism.
He presented the presentation of weak conduct and decided to change the trainer after the pressure of puberty fans.
And since his free day was canceled after the game, Lehmann marked Lehmann as a sign of the lack of sovereignty and revenge.
Lehman's products "forms pure egoism", replied Heldt and announced the consequences for the bankers.
Both four-year-olds won't have any joy in life anymore.
In any case, they are in agreement with others that without the work of a team of trained men, it would not be possible to be as strong and combative as possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great part of success," say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and a man with an Igalitian bag agrees.
Sobow of the world's mystery in a difficult relationship
Your duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson has constantly provoked words and gestures by the world's mystery Vitaly Klička.
However, after 12 hard cars, Ukrainians began their title in the heavy bond of the WBC boxer organization.
The product of the decisions was uniform.
Hamburg - Vitaly Kličko remains the world's master in the box in a difficult relationship.
The 38-year WBC champion won Saturday night in Bern American Kevin Johnson unanimously on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klička it is the third successful round of title after its return in October 2008.
In the past, Ukraine was twice the world's master of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen to anyone else who expected it.
The call improved his balance on 39 winnings in 41 professional matches twice as a result of injury.
The Johnson challenger was first defeated in the 24th file.
Before the crowd of 17,000 fans in the Bernese arena, he drove 2,02 metres high Click fight primarily with his doctor.
About ten inches lower than Johnson, who announced the end of the Kličko era before the duel, but stood before the attacks of the world's mystery, so Kličko could not put a decisive hit on his dangerous path.
All he did was do passive Johnson to the challenger a little bit and he just tried to get into other circles.
The voice of the river caused words and gestures, his wounds, but the mystery of the world was just small.
But it's still the second boxer after Tim Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Klick for twelve rounds.
The challenger was taking care of the first battle in the Swiss main town of dissipation.
He's got a call like "responsive zombie," which "nothing can be right."
During the fifth grade, he let the champion out, pulled Johnson out of the nose of the sunglasses, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Click Return
The call remained intact after its fourth file on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years of stopover he won in Berlin, Nigeria's Samuel Peter and took back his "own" WBC belt, which he had to leave before without a fight.
In this year he won the title of Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Areola from the United States.
In this file I got only one wound and physically in good shape, causing Click to return to the ring.
His dream remains, but it is the cover of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world's master of WBO and IBF.
The WBA is wearing, however, Brit David Haye, who sat on the throne in November of the height of 2,13 feet [2.13 m] of Nikola Vulaje.
Haye fired in the summer fight against Kličk, which was planned for the harvest.
Apparently his promotional company is planning a fight against Kličkov in the London Wembley Stadium.
Conduz case
General attack from the opposition: Chief of the Greens Jürgen Trittin identified the Minister of Defence Kunduz as a liar.
SPD and Linke (Levie) call the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlín - According to the latest news on the Kunduz landing, the opposition is believed to have been allowed by the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU).
When two tanks were bombed in September, the minister said "I don't know," the chief of the Greens Jürgen Trittin's group said in the ARD "Tagesschau" Saturday report.
Let's call it a regular expression: Lhal.
The murder report was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That's the basic message that NATO had, Mr. Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday it was announced that the attack was not only about the destruction of abandoned freight cars, but also about the purpose of killing two Taliban leaders.
At the U.S. strike, which was requested by the German leader Kunduzu, Colonel Klein, by NATO investigation into the killing or injury of up to 142 people.
Greening, SPD and Linke called on the joint Chancellor Angel Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express themselves immediately before the Coalition and also to explain what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Ms. Merkel has to explain whether the strategy for the targeted killing is part of the Afghan Joint Dream policy - and if the Office of Chancellor, Bundeswehr and the Reporting Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and a colleague from the Green Renate Künastová have called on Jürgen Trittin.
Speaking by the government Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected criticism.
The Office of Chancellor has no influence on the specific find of Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there was also a voice of doubts about the appointment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the information provided by SPIEGEL, both Guttenberga were informed correctly and fully about the background of the attack on the tank.
It officially stated that they should reject the existence of the NATO report and conceal sensitive details to the ministers.
However, around the two senior officials, it was reported that they had even warned the Ministry of Defence on several reports, including the document of Colonel Klein and one report of the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sontagszeitung" reports that Wichert had to request in a letter explaining the situation.
It is noted that he has not yet received any answers.
The Ministry did not express itself on Saturday and indicated that this would be resolved in the study committee of the Coalition Chamber, which would be set up next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see in the early state of the image and hear voices that the others do not see and hear.
Not only do mental illness or drug addiction affect the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it's in bed, it's all right.
If we are lying in our dark room with our closed eyes, we can cover up the most amazing ideas and fantasies.
However, those who live in the old age of speech see and hear things that others do not see and hear, pay most of today’s Western world for jokes or drugs, or at least for envy.
However, such images and voices do not occur only in mental patients or in drug addiction.
Vinu has our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, here and there make it possible for us to cross the border between dreams, imagination and reality.
Dreams of a changed state of consciousness can be expressed in the most diverse forms, in a better case, we call them vision, in worse error.
Even if the initiator and effect may disappear, however, the mystical vision of Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New-Age Carlos Castanedy prophet, the shaman state of blustering, psychosis and hallucination can lead to similar processes.
Hallucination or vision results when neuronal transmission of the brain is improved - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and interaction between different parts of the brain is eliminated.
Complex hallucinations and foolish thoughts are very common in psychosis.
Gravitation over him doesn't have much.
The relationship between the wrong and the dream involved philosophy and doctors from ancient times.
Aristotle understood Hallucination as a form of sleep in an early state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, observed in 1861 "a great similarity of confusion with sleep conditions", for Sigmund Freuda was even dreaming "psychosis, with all nonsense, madness, deceit".
It's the summer of 2001, Henning T. is changing into a comic book.
Its body is double-sized and clumsy.
Gravity doesn't have any power over him. He's known as the top of the room.
It's over.
He's surrounded by red blood cells with red gloves, precious teeth.
They bury him, they dig into him with heavy, burning boots, heaves with him about the wall, they feel pain all over the body.
Voice, bad voices threaten the wall and the radio.
He can't speak any more of the voices that he's been given and hated.
Henning T. removes two cables from the stereo, puts them into the drawer and puts them on the corner of the ceiling.
You're going to be on one player and you're gonna get your shirt around your neck.
Jump.
The shirt's okay.
Learn, a bunch of voices with his bubonics, "Go to the clinic and let him be treated!"
Today Heningu T. 40 years old, has lived six acute psychosis, the last two years, almost 20 years ago.
They were released LSD.
His diagnosis is a schizophrenic paranoia, besides maniodepressive, taking drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his own disabilities, he's married for three years.
I've experienced the worst fear in my psychotic life and the deepest doubts, she says.
Examples are terrible reality
About one percent of people are at least once for schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is the second most commonly treated disease after depression.
In acute psychosis, they can no longer reach the majority of the internal and external world, getting into an overstated state that can lead to hallucinations, sizes, relationship illusions or illusions of detection.
In particular, there is wide hearing of voices - voices that order, comment or lead dialogues.
Not even optical hallucinations are unusual.
A hit is not able to distinguish important from an unnecessary, it can't filter negative signals, knowledge is flooded with findings.
Like the dream of an open psychosis, the idea and fantasy come from the deepest forms of consciousness.
Focusing on the reality of psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, top doctor of the Clinics of General Psychiatry University Clinics at Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of the action, everything has a focus on it.
At the same time it gets into a passive role, it becomes, like in a dream, capable of events and cannot be actively formed.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Compared with reality, most of them are not possible, the miracles are a terrible reality, the temptation is excluded.
One for life to experience hallucinations
Unlike in the dream, Fuchss says, "There remains but a meaningful and spatial structure of reality that man takes into mind in his psychosis is basically kept."
Bad thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, to suppress the survival comes within a real framework.
Scientists are still standing in front of the guess why our brain is doing this kind of thing.
Exceptional attitudes can lead to short-term loss of relationship to reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone gets into psychosis.
There seems to be genetics available to schizophrenia, but double-blind studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists are from the fact that infected persons have minimal brain damage.
We believe that early development will result in damage to neuronal brain damage, such as viral mother disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a challenge to find out how the neurological system that has not survived for so long.
Roles also play an impact on the environment - stress or traumatic experiences can be an initiator of psychosis if available.
Haulucinogenic drugs can also cause psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain is closed
It is estimated that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to escape them, they call expensive drugs, others give money for drugs to get them, says professor of psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If we view mistakes as acceptable or unacceptable, there is often only one question.
Kasten has been collecting news about hallucinations and floods for ten years, in a long year he interpreted his results in the book "Die Irreal World in Our Kopf" (The Real World in Our Head).
Hallucination is one of the most common diseases of the brain, but it is also surprising to see many other diseases.
According to psychotic disorders such as limited personality or depression are also common disorders such as migraine, epilepsy, frustrated sclerosis or Alzheimer’s or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, it hallucinates for certain conditions and even the brain of a healthy person.
Halucination, according to Kasten, consists of the contents of the thoughts that are normally embedded.
They occur when the parts of the brain in which meaningful attention is being processed are too active or slightly absorbed; if our brain is blocked or if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can be as destructive as brain damage or psychosis.
But also take away encouragement, stress, care with love or other exceptional circumstances.
In recent studies, up to three thirds of those who were asked to experience hallucinations once in their lives.
In 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Meklenburg-Premier Beach and going to a darker gymnasium.
Actually, it's a totally normal girl.
If those pictures and voices weren't here.
It can be said that she'll end up with long, dark hair.
When he answers, they look at her with surprise - no one else but she sees and hears this boy.
This ridiculous girl thinks a drunk picture, but Sarah K. doesn't smell, she knows.
He's up there, he's hearing and he's seeing this boy, just like he's hearing and he's seeing a girl sitting next to him in the battle.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling. I like that boy.
I'm crazy?
But he knows that this boy and other perverts are not real and disappear again.
In the night there are more calling
There's a lot of trouble going on.
When he is in class, he cannot follow education at all times, because the teacher in his eyes and ears is right representing a new partner, but he explains to all the other hearing and visible on the mathematical equation table.
In the night, there's more calling.
When waiting in his dark room for a bed that comes small and too late, he cannot often discern whether he is up or he is asleep, whether the images that he sees, gremases, or girls with bleeding cut wounds on their hands and feet appear before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone. He's screaming at those posts.
Parents and friends wouldn't say anything about it, they'd think she was crazy.
I'm seeing 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
Vloni made a maturite and lives with his friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she didn't get mad.
Overhaul is also art of art
If someone is socially isolated or is encouraged, he will have a high probability of hallucination, says Kasten.
I think the brain doesn't have enough employment and she's taking care of her own fun.
Sarah K., the only girl, had a little girl of fear from other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at age 13 that the man she's been calling from when she thinks she's not her own father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations are active the same brain areas that also process real perceptions and sounds, are achieved as Sarah K. difficult to distinguish between themselves and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is playing in the brain, and the reality is also shown there.
Hallucinations are also images that allow the brain to develop, which is why it does so real."
The night's sleep also evaluates Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Halucination in healthy people is not essentially different from hallucination in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mental health people are able to identify their mistakes as unrealistic.
Casten therefore recommends to his patients that they evaluate hallucinations as an exceptional ability.
Limitation between sleep and hallucination
In our world too focused on science, the imaginary experience is mostly pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic clinics of Florence-Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a difficult, patient disease, but it also brings positive, creativeity - excess is also art of fantasy.
Schmidt-Degenhard examined what is known as the oneiroid form of experiences, especially the form of changed consciousness to sleep.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the person concerned considers to be real and cannot even distinguish them from the white state.
Oneiroid consciousness results in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, for example by polyradicular infection patients who are fully aware of motor protection.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps with a permanent, complete inability to move, he rewards a life that threatens the real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is alienated from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
The type of bordering state between sleep and hallucination.
Because it's not really possible to control some situation, it's going to change the world, but it's real.
The intensive form of support for meanings and translation of meanings in some unsound situation that allows people to transform their own ability to go through the moment of loss of consciousness.
It's all real, even later in memories.
Also the history of art Peter Cornelius Clausen describes his ionoid experiences in his book "Herzechsel" (The Change of Heart) as a lifesaving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when after surgery a heart surgeon with the following heart transplanted heart released his consciousness on a few days’ journey, while his body lay constantly on a unit of intensive care.
Claussen went into the world he created, visited other times and places: He became an old man who was put on a bed in a train sanatorium, a robot watching his health.
He lives in an early midlife between the spaghetti that makes the blood clots.
On the engine, the river enters it into its own, on the hospital bed surfes on the farm in the Alps and falls down to the Korean mafia.
It's going to be full of imaginary events, everything's real, even later in memories.
These internal roads are essentially different from any dream for Clausen.
Sen is different, describing his experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of these mental pathways are clearly clear after years and in minor details.
Even clearer and more intense than real life.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other real experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finallys show the ionoid conditions, psychosis, hallucinations and drug addictions, how wrong our internal images are even in the early state of our external reality.
Every change in the state of consciousness, says psychologist Kasten, "can lead to the deformation of what we say is real."
A reality that can also be enriching.
Snow can come in
Burda
In 27 children are expected to take custody of their children
The new leadership of Kallen is a transitional solution: For a long time, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children, Spiegel said.
Holding has to be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Captain Hubert Burda sees his business long ago in the hands of his children.
Both children will grow up at 27 years of age and have a strong desire to enter the company, says the 69-year-old man SPIEGEL.
We've dealt with it carefully.
The question whether they are also active in the company is raised until then.
And the question is whether they're capable of it.
It is not possible to set up 7500 employees of their children if they are not able enough.
It would kill like children, so a business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he had been taking part in the presidency since January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his representative.
Since 1999, Kallen has been a member of the Burdy Summit.
First of all, he had technology.
Later, Kokladna added responsibility for the property of the company and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer as well as the main marketing, Cizina, Print and Finance.
First, none of the family members are in charge of custody.
The Burd's child is 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Callena's appointment also serves as "fucking 10, 15 years," Burd told us.
Holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, says Burda.
In view of Schickedanz and Schaeffler's case, Burda stated that neither family companies have any security before the crash: "It has always been to a company that has been allowed to be hit by a storm after the capital they speculated about and thought they could become big players.
It was never my strategy.
He never had "a dream of world power," says Burd.
I don't care about being the political leader of this country, like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time", these businesses are too big.

Endes in Barcelona, with electric motor
The energy company Endesa, together with the Barcelona office, founded 'LIVE Chancellor'.
This is a project for the development and processing of an electric vehicle in the main city of Catalán.
The LIFE Office (Electromotive Logistics) will establish and manage a roadmap for the introduction of motor vehicles in the city and ensure an agreement in the area of mobility, will design, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electronic cars, collect views and results of activities in the related sectors.
In general, the aim is to support this means of transport for the future.
3 'Electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city that is involved in the construction of electric vehicles in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also join the project.
It is the three cities that the government has chosen under the MOVELE Plan to support the launch of electric vehicles.
The energy company Endes has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan autonomous area.
This includes energy-related activities and particularly energy efficiency.
It's not about the only initiative with Endesy's participation, which concerns the processing of electromobiles.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a 'climate period' in the car industry.
The president of the government José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish car industry, the main export sector of the state, is waiting for a "climate period".
In the economic report of the President of the Government for 2009 Zapatero outlined the measures taken during the year to support the car sector.
"Without a competition plan for the automotive industry, we would be expected today to be left behind to close up some of our main manufacturing companies," the government president said.
"As a result of this plan and the expectation of individual characteristics, further action in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of rest for this industry, which is our main export sector, is envisaged in the future," he added.
In this sense, he pointed out that the competition plan, which forms part of the Integral Automotive Plan (PIA), set 800 million on projects 19 producers and 137 subsidiary companies that mobilized investment of EUR 3 billion.
The President explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and ongoing processes.
The vice-president also highlighted the government’s support measures and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is applied in cooperation with autonomous areas and car signs.
According to the president, this plan has enabled a reduction of 6% of the average emissions in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and has ensured a "significant increase" of revenue, in particular in November of "40%".
2 000 square metres of classical vehicles
The first International Hall of Classic Vehicles will be opened in Madrid, which is a meeting room for professionals and amateurs from the world of motors.
This initiative will take place on 5 - 7 February 2010 in the Madrid House of Campo.
It is an exhibition area of over 20 000 square metres, representing more than 200 Turkish and foreign exhibitors.
Here you can find not only classic motorcycles and cars but also in ClassicAuto Madrid products of all types related to the world of engines.
Exhibitionrs in the palace will offer accessories, replacement parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Stocks of products related to classical motors, real sheets for collectors and scientists.
Among the companies involved will be:Classicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lubreras, renewal; Coupe-France Pueche, sales and renewal of cars; or Cochera Classicos, specialised Mercedes Benz.
Experimental test
In addition, the commercial activity of this hall will be complemented by parallel activities: centralisation, sports performance, test capacity, presentation and competition.
Tests will also be carried out in classical cars and motorcycles in the appropriate area outside the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Maintaining a sports style
Maybe she'll be able to show that environmental security has no negative impact on sports style.
And that's why Mazda3 has a built-in stop and start-up system - also baptized as-Stop- which is a device that is currently available only with a petrol engine 2.0 150 horses.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by the good qualities that have been achieved as a whole.
Surface maintenance, vehicle operation, citizenship, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding at Mazda3.
The former seating places of the driver have outstanding ergonomics and are highly sophisticated.
The volunteer is also extremely friendly.
With tools and consoles, we will conclude that Mazda is continuing in Japan's trend in developing a futuristic design with many buttons and drivers and an excellent red and blue color.
This style partly reminds us of a style that also presents Honda Civic.
We can also say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contrasting with the complexity of German products and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to win.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who pass a very comfortable ride.
In addition, there is a need to mention the great condom space and regular shapes.
The system of automatic stop and start of the engine is currently available only with a petrol engine at two litres and 150 horse-powered assay manual.
This engine is really smooth. It's very nice, marked by a low-fat, its performance and its lower consumption.
Although this most demanding Mazda3 is in the version of diesel, all those who do not travel so many miles per year should not exclude this i-Stop with a petrol engine, as it is marked by greater comfort at driving and reduced consumption.
As far as equipment is concerned, the version chosen for testing is called Sportsve and includes a larger number of serial elements.
In a series of equipment, it is necessary to mention a particular system of monitoring of the train brakes (RVM), which prevents the cause of the dead function, control of breath and stability, control of speed, internal vision sensitive to light, deck computer with large screen, parking lights, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and wheels from 17palc shillings.
And if the equipment was not available, this version would be equipped with Pack Premium, for example 1,500 euros: two-exchange and audio BOSE system with CD holder, except for other parts.
End
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It shall be characterized in particular by the quality of the materials used, its operation and its high level of equipment.
And in addition to people who don't reach a larger number of miles per year, they can choose this i-Stop version, which is only with a petrol engine 2.0 and 150 horses.
The only non-exhaustive of this model is its highest price, which makes it €21.770 for the launch of Luxury and €23.270 for the tested version -Sportive-.
For this high price Mazda3 offers a high dose of rest for each day.
Luxury 'primary'
L.A. has a red blanket, fine as Penelope Cruz's hands, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars had more than ever spent themselves in new elegant and sexy models of 'Nine' characters. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose dark 'lady'.
Slib Fonpeek
Peek is extremely limited, only serves to view mail, without the possibility of viewing a particular type of attachment or surfing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of celebration in the United States when her Time magazine assessed her as one of the products of the year.
It's harder to see her outside, but that idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is marked by very low price and monthly payments, less than half of which are paid for the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began to offer two new devices: one is exclusively for Twitter, the other is based on a continuous free-of-charge data service, which, however, needs to be paid for Peek’s sixteenth share.
FonPeek, who was represented on Le Web yesterday, is a European version of the search and at the same time its third version.
He's just as limited as his American opponent, but it's a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price is approximately 12 euros a month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People travelling with smartphones already know what it means to come up with data services after crossing borders or to look out for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a phone connection) so they can watch mail.
The event with a real price rooming is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but my experience suggests that a person would need a doctor from physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read a miniature letter.
The European Commission continues to call for a reduction in roaming tariffs so that they can be made available for Europe as a whole, which still has no effect.
There is a fundamental concern here about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that a device such as FonPeek (is interesting that it still has the name Fon if it does not have Wifi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators start thinking differently and consider various offers that would compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offers bookkeeping and other online search.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and paid at the time of purchase, never after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen once in the case of FonPeek, it's about the possibility of buying with permanent access as Peek has already been put in the United States.
Not because I wanted to buy it.
I'm watching my phone mail, thank you.
I expect it because I think it's the best kind of consumer I've ever seen.
It would be interesting if this system could be used in computers.
A color that adores Michelle
The yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first ladies of the United States.
For the performance of the President Baracka Obama she chose clothes and bathed in this colour, and she also chose the same color when she delivered it at the second most significant moment of her life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: besides that it's about a similar color - glutted with three-effects - in both cases it's about a variety of complete - clothing, jacket and hat from the same substance- shaped with a large upper or upper.
At first glance it seemed that the first woman in the United States decided to go to the steps of the Asturias princess and wear a similar dress.
The fabric from which the clothing is made makes both models very different.
On the occasion of Michelle's entry into service, she used a large area in Oslo with pressure.
Amenities and supplements: green boots are medium-high bottom, similar to the current model, but in gold.
It also contains various ingredients: this timedrol, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have work problems related to maternity.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially in the women of young people who are willing to adopt a child.
This is the result of the study 'Fultility and career of Spanish women' which CSIC conducted in cooperation with the Institute of Women.
The study was attended by 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 and the results are unique: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labour market due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the number of children at the start of a partnership relationship according to whether they work or not and also by the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work for part-time or have no stable work, start living with a partner before birth and have more children in general.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, particularly in the public sector, have a partner relationship and have fewer offspring.
"The women between 35 and 49 years of stable employment have the first child on average 3.7 years from the beginning of their relationship with the partner. This figure is 4.1 in the case of women who have given up their stable employment most of their lives and therefore had to postpone their partner life and children's future.
The type of call also has a strong impact on maternal health, although less impact at the time of contact with the partner," explains Margarita Delgado, who is committed to research in CSIC.
Another factor affecting women’s age at the time of closure of their marriage is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher education levels are, the higher the age the women get married and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in age groups 35 to 49, women were born with primary and higher education at the age of 25,1 e.g. 32.1.
"There is still another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women are given basic education and are born before they find stable employment, while women are treated with secondary or higher education, give priority to obtaining stable employment, before marriage and the birth of the first child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger also deserves it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
Since the next year, the German heretic will become the form of various products of this sign under the universal word 'Because I stand for it'.
The representative of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant heretics at international level, adds to the other famous personalitiesL'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her they entered this selected group of Evangeline Lilly's heretics and Freida Pinto's' Millionaire'.
The Panamanian part of this landmark is also represented by the important characters: Patrick Dempsey ('Greyova anatomia') and Matthew Fox (Eggilin's partner in 'Dear').
Prices of British methods
Brits have a lot to talk about.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, previous and present - met at the annual price presentation held in London at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one's ever missed a meeting.

Poker Manuela Vicenta
Manuel Vicent provides thirty X-ray photographs of the writers he met in his literary life (and in some cases in ordinary life).
He does so in the feared and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), although he is looking for something similar to a core of personality.
The road brings excitement and Vicent doesn't save the streets or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reader’s benefit, even when it is read over and over again.
I'm going to introduce you to some of the stairs here.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, although spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as I feel, but it can't be called: life of the opposite sex, moral without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and never intelligence, something between weakness and ignorance, with a sensitive poetic humour, without any meaning, as if it were a knife that almost killed her."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been devoted to this woman for thirty years, cysolation, love and education, which is a spiritual height for reaching heaven's path of destruction."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssea was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight-footed peaks in universal literature that needs to be converted from the north side, from which the best watches are often seen."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
He's himself, he said he's the grandfather of a crew shipr, or else he's a son of a black man with a crocodile.
In both cases it was about a big dream."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up on the bridge a huge shout of this man from Munich to bring his call to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, running before him and calling for a future and swift talk to the Reds."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she cried and prayed: "My dear God, let me stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were the openings of Spencer's verses: "After the effort comes the dream,/after the storm of calmness,/after the war of rest,/after the full life of death."
About Virginia Wolf: "He also led his depression in his engagements.
The husband fully agreed to tell him that Edward VII was following her among the donkeys or that the birds were singing Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with neurotics whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martin Santos have to do than focus on Joyce on Baroness?
What else happened to Benet than to let Baro's weapon be repaired by Faulkner?
What is the matter with Cele instead of being celebrated for the praise of this man?"
Wrong Aggression
Last week my seventy-year-old mother passed our fourth, during the Fuenlabrad period, and a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 years of age had a cycle and our dog, a cross that was saved from a weight of up to six kilograms, without a single word that hit her twice and seriously.
Our frustration is greater because we see nothing funny in such aggression against the small and vulnerable animal that was also on the guide.
And to this shock, the old lady after the incident, when she met these individuals, began to fear her own safety, for such a demon possessed by an animal attacker is able to do the same for a woman, a child, an old man or anyone who is worse than himself.
It happened in five o'clock in the afternoon, usually in a quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been missing all day.
Of course, we have been concerned about the closest commissions, but we doubt that this is something, and so that we don't raise theological questions, we find these innocent victims to be Spanish people.
The explosion took us to make this reality known.
We do not understand what is happening to today’s youth when it comes to the suffering of defenseless animals that give us love, company, and friendship.
We don't understand where proper behavior is shared, respect for animals and humans.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helm
The producer of Michelin pneumatics in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Authority (Fesvial) launched a campaign to support the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as both of them have reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of the use of helmets because it is the only means to prevent head injury and death in the event of an accident when driving on a motorcycle.
The company Michelin points out that this campaign is part of its transport safety commitments, which "means more than design and manufacture more safe products", and has confirmed that it is trying to fulfil this objective, i.e. the form of an educational and information campaign.
This new campaign to support the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the word 'To be or not to be', is the first phase when more than 500 motorcycles are fixed up to get to the wider public.
Finally, Michelin warned that transport safety "is a permanent problem" of this company, which is the manufacturer of pneumatics for dual-vehicle vehicles and its main objective is to increase the safety of products.
Increased sales of light commercial vehicles
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles will begin to be remembered.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November meant an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and more, it was the first increase after 22 months of permanent accident, according to the number of parental organisations of Anfac and Ganvam sellers.
However, the available data is better to be included in the quarantine, as November 2008 is a very bad time for comparison and meant a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, regardless of the rise in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is less than 40% than in the previous accounting year.
Since January, 95.853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles belonging to the category of light commercial vehicles: personal cars derivatives, pick ups, supplies, less expensive cars and light trucks/submodules.
And they didn't lose any stamps, which are most damaging to the demand, even though they bought it by private persons, most of the purchases were carried out by smaller and medium-sized companies, and almost 100% of the cases relate to financing by third parties.
Other factors such as the cessation of activities or the continuation of the bad economic situation should be added to the restriction resulting from the closure of the bank’s resources.
In this situation, in contrast to personal vehicles, support for the purchase of 2000E was not too helpful.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention the persons undertaking on the biofuel list of small and medium-sized enterprises who are willing to buy a light commercial vehicle up to 3,5 tonnes of CO2 cold-exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Yesterday, Ganvam was reminded again that special attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (cyconies and buses).
The sales association estimates that in 2010 development will be similar to lead and that sales in personal vehicles and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The hand-held support system is already a necessary equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-locking system, this will also be done with the management of the stability of the ESP, assistable handrail systems, all of which will be required by the provision of European vehicles.
In fact, it is already part of the mandatory provision of all new self-propelled vehicles and light commercial vehicles, while in the rest there is a deadline for the removal of the deficiency, which is February 2011.
The EU-wide measures are aimed at increasing the protection of pedestrians, which is so effective that they can be used in many conflicts.
The auxiliary handwheel system increases pressure on the brakes in an emergency case, which the system will find out when the driver is down.
But it's not always possible to keep this pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the Bosch car manufacturers, three thirds of drivers who had an accident did not get the brake before the strike and half of them did not use the full force of the brake.
Up to 1,100 accidents
However, this aid requires the maximum speed system and the rapid distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU alone, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 fatal accidents related to pedestrians could occur annually.
The reduction of this figure will be even more significant-than the calculations would prevent one of the four accidents affecting persons-after the introduction of so-called smart hand mill systems.
In this case, vehicles will be equipped with a system which (through radar or cameras) captures obstacles and reports to drivers, except for easy braking.
If the driver reacts, he can increase pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond, and even if the driver is unable to prevent it, the device will act as a non-intensity to the brake and reduce the risk of damage to the minimum.
General Motors delivers a plan for Opel until winter
Nick Reilly, new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of the month of deep - probably 8 April - as told by Javier Ortega, an American producer warns that more time will be needed to complete the Opel recovery plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is working to ensure that each item of the plan is first agreed with the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will be first submitted to employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production industry is established, may be issued by the early 2010 deadline.
However, the GM ensures that the Saab sales decision should be taken in those days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American producer to take certain decisions first.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also had before obtained Volvo, but considered the possibility of a Dutch manufacturer of Skiper's sports vehicles, which is under the protection of the Russian Converg group.
If it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some of the assets of Saab Chinese Baic.
It will continue to decide to close Saab by the end of the year if its sale is not made.
Horse with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this quality model, engineers from Porsche used Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce weight by 80 kg, so the weight indicates only 1.275 kg.
On the basis of the first line, the automatic storage layer was in payment with manual control which reduced the weight by 21 kg; it continued to be used at the railway door, such as GT3, which means 15 kg less; the removal of air conditioning,13 reduction of fuel storage from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a reduction of other 7 kg; after the installation of other 12 kg sports seats, thanks to the 19palco’s five kilograms.
Finally, the removal of the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less, and the replacement of the door doors with the textile doors means another kilogram.
It is also offered with a double PDK transmission, one vehicle with a hand-held six-phase speed shield was tested, mainly on the second-class railways in California, on the mountain slopes with a lot of net loads.
His behavior can only be qualified as unreachable.
The reduction in weight does not mean that the vehicle is ineffective to the asphalt.
On the other hand, we have not tested such a small and easy model for a long time, which would at the same time provide such security in the movement of prisoners, even in high speeds.
It's a small atlet capable of playing muscle during a short ride after the necessary time, until we order it to sprint, waving, and reusing the engine...
Whatever we want, thanks to the procedure that is so communicative as precise, whatever we mark with our hands on the wheel, it's what the car does.
And he'll do it with surgery.
The sound of the engine by choice
The V6 boxer sound of 320 horses (of 10 more than Boxster S) is a very gift and it is possible to enable it to 'sport' and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was used in Panama.
Capacitating acceleration is brutal whether it is already in use or recovery.
The charges are firm, but they're not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the train that we're going through with Boxster Spyder was quite destroyed, but the car was well able to handle the demands.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; however, in some cases we have been struck by lightning and lightning even in the near future.
Finally, this ultra-annual vehicle is one of the most popular on the market, as it is more than just modifying Boxster S.
The car will be marketed in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bug Girl'
Friends Karla Lagerfelda, the icon of the Coco Cocoon series and the opportunity 'startette' on the 'business' views, the singer presents his face to the evil girl as he acts like his cables Chanel.

Bashconia has won in Israel
The workshop won a brilliant win in 82-91 at its host at the complicated Maccabi Electric game, despite a number of absences in Duska Ivanovice, and thus got to the head of its group after the great performance of Mirzy Teletovice, which with eight triple points was the best in the company (29 reviews).
The company Vitorie has been able to compensate for the significant incompatibility of Herrmann, Olesona, Huertase or Mikova with a large dose of recovery and collective work, although it had to endure to the end in order to win.
In addition, the vast accuracy of 16 triangles has contributed greatly to the final triumph.
The game started with the head for the blues that have been on the mark since the beginning.
That the first four goats for Vitori were from a distance, which already meant that they had stuck to Israel’s society very hard.
English and Teletovic belonged to the main shooter 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Albanian society decided for Baraca’s internal game and Elijah’s work, which was adopted by singing and singing on its original way back to increase the benefit before the start of the stop (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to be the best in his company with 13 points, although 'without six' in the evaluation of Splitter already meant that this would not be the best evening for Brazil.
But although the game was sharp until the stop, it was not decided in the least and the Maccabees wanted to remind Victoria that everyone in their game won't win, and 'Elías' could win.
Eidson and Pinini have definitely contributed to the return of 'gold' (50-49).
More inappropriate
Ivanovic's members, injured but not dead at all, needed a number of precise herries to collect rain, and then the Mirza Teletovic column was revealed, which was three-thirds behind him and with the help of English and Ribase returned the scores to the resting number (54-67), which reached local by the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Avalanches have been sitting in the last part and English and San Emerio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to prepare them for the results of the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their husband, did not give up and tried to keep society alive from three points (70-77).
Despite this and with Splitter released for Faul Sevanovic, they did not look back and defend themselves well, and although Israel approached the final minute (80-85), the game had already won aTel Aviv first in the season.
The injuries do not make it impossible for the Union to fight
The Union has played a significant role in Greece with Olympics and has abandoned the leadership of Group B in Eurolize, which has been marked by three attacks by the Union, but in particular by the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which has facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagian society is not divided between peace and friendship or competition, perhaps one of the most ill in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed Andalusans to sleep. Aggressive defense and three third points after each other, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillema Rubia, released the game from 12-18, minutes 9.
Olympias was surprised at the intensity of Unicia , although the arsenal of locals in the internal game with Bourusis, Vujci and Schortsanits, surrounded the score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between opponents with the USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek society began to function and demonstrated its movement in both areas where the absence of English beer due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez made it difficult for the Society of Unicia
Between the domestic players and the Lithuanian Linas Kleiss with the third points increased the benefit by 44-32, minutes 19.
Impossible to retrieve
The third was very aggressive by Olimpiacos, who, however, had lost 19, demonstrated movement and was even able to make a difference between the game in Malaga 66-48, a 27-minute walk that was conducted in the group.
Unicija tried to overcome the absence and the latest incompatibility of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last game.
Despite all of this, thanks to the leadership and the three-point Cook and Lewis' contribution, the Unicia left the hope of winning 66-57, minutes 31.
But it was practically impossible because Olympics proved it unstoppable by strengthening and moving in centimetres in their area.
Croatian Pivot Nikola Vujcic, proved the equivalent of avalerage 81-62, minutes 37, and Unicaja called and handed over the management of Olympics.
How much should you put into your profile on Facebook?
Facebook users can be contacted by a pay that is worthy of their profile, thanks to new applications Find, searchers with the largest number of classified ads from reality, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
Tool How much should you take? Calculated user fees on the basis of more than 140.000 job offers available in Spain, using a form available on Facebook where there are professions, years of experience, age and city where interests are to work first.
During the week that the application works, the searcher found that the Spanish employee was generally "feeling badly rewarded", explained in his report Albert Rivera responsible for the product Trovit.
According to data available to find their search engine in Great Britain and France, Spain is the highest payment.
The British programmer takes 45.226 euros gross annually and French 31.059, while Spain receives 24000.
The same driver has a fee of €34,247 a year in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, Spain is the highest number of jobs for the cleaning industry with €11.592 a year, followed by a salesman with €14.725 and a worker with €15.667.
The most sought-in employment online in the last three months are drivers, half-employed and social workers.
Brazil fixed the date of Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has established a term of detention for Manuel Zelayi at his embassy in Tegucigalp.
The President-in-Office shall leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when he has officially completed his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, the manager of the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed for TV Globo that "Mel" knows he has to leave the embassy where he has been hiding since September 21.
"It is known that on January 27th, after the end of his mandate, he must go and look for another shelter."
The station also quoted the former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the protection of the Brazilian government," Zelaya phonetic said.
After the elections of 29 November (when Porfirio Lobo was elected) Zelaya made sure that he was on the Brazilian embassy until winter.
However, this week he tried to find a shelter in Brazil.
The operation was finally wasted because Zelaya rejected the terms of the political asylum that he was trying to impose on him by the government "de facto", which President Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and varieties from the past year when the active inflation represented a dominant market burden, there was a uncertainty on the markets again, which should not be surprising because it is already a natural state in the environment where leaders make decisions about the future that they themselves do not know about.
The drug used by central banks for market stabilization was the delay in the direct purchase of assets and the indirect release of liquidity in the course of a close zero so that financial institutions can buy assets for calculation.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have already ended in practice, and without any doubt their unsound liquidity policy, begin to raise a bit of money in the environment as the Spanish Central Bank has done with its auction in the long term.
Investors are therefore concerned about the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are participating in the return of risk reduction.
The mobility of the boroughs and the division of debt companies has again received points, although they are still very far away from normal levels reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialise private risks, which once again affected public debt.
Once again, it is focusing on quality and the US, Japan and Germany have become the target of the selected investors, which has widened the differences between the euro area countries towards Germany.
This unstable Spanish was almost unstoppable, but at the time it came to Standard & Poor's and threatened a new revision of the fall in the qualification of the Spanish kingdom.
On the other hand, certain uncertainty is not useful in hiding moral risks that once again try to impose a conscience on those responsible for the global economic policy because of the deterioration of the negative effects of the employment limit when a new day of reflection should actually be announced.
However, the situation in Dubai represents the ethnic conflicts between the emies of power renewal in immigration, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that hides deficits, elections and new government is present.
He did so in Italy after Berluscon and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barrosov.
There is no reason for Ecofin to save Hungary from the failure of foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro Member State to fulfil its obligations.
However, it is logical that Ecofin should bring the Greek government to the point of putting its own citizens in a position of common responsibility, where there is a need for special measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are before the period of normalisation of the premium from the transitional risk, after some excess of the supported positions would be within the framework of the expectation.
In Spanish, while our differences in public debt will be raised as the debt of European companies, we should not be concerned.
If Europe's differences are decreasing and ours will continue to expand, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The relevance of Standard & Poor's is only anaecdota. When our previous indicators encourage most of the study services to go ahead with their renewal scenarios and revising their scenario to start in 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it is not a great hope for the Spanish economy to achieve this warning.
Again it seems that it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, despite the passing of "carefully, friends of drivers".

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán, as the first one yesterday, took part in the parliamentary seminar, where the Spanish energy strategy is currently underway in the next two decades.
Following his intervention following the presentation of President Gas Natural-Fenos, Rafaele Villasecy, Galán gave a number of comments on the proposal submitted by the subcommissions behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol of Spain, investment of EUR 50,000 million by 2020 and other 60,000 from this date by 2030 is needed if nuclear power is maintained, which are currently in operation.
If it hadn't happened, the necessary investments would not be 60,000 million or 95 billion.
Iberdrol is indeed considered to have to focus on investment in the next decade not to increase production capacity, despite distribution networks and international mergers
Since 2020, the issue has changed and needs to be increased.
Its offer focuses on the gas and wet electricity with the cooling mechanism and particularly on renewable energy.
In this case it is considered that there is a need for new 18,000 MWs, as well as other "supportable energy".
Galán, who is believed to be a woman of the law on a sustainable economy that was just adopted by the government, is in line with the line requested by the company, did not want to leave his life as a royal decree to support the consumption of national coal, which supports anti-climate policy.
In his view, "a clear long line" is in this sense, despite the "precise" measure, as President Iberdrol called it.
In any case, Galán is considered to be a long-term investment decision, since their monitoring is ongoing and a stable tax framework is needed for their initiation.
Railway won 'action' Aer Lingus on the 10th anniversary
The daughter of Ferrovial for ground services, Switzerland for Swiss sport, will play the role of the Irish Aer Lingus preferred company for cost services at 10 European airports where she is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels belong to the most important of them.
The agreement that has not yet fulfilled the economic terms shall be valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday the Protocol on Cooperation in the Development of the Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The Association proposes to invest 20 million by 2012, of which 50% belong to Ferrovial.
One of the medium-sized tasks will be the research of energy efficiency in the distance and airport.
Action moves on its first route to Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Action is fighting for its first remote concession in Australia, which is a market where it already works as an energy and water business.
The construction of the tunnel is estimated at $1,700 million in Australia (about €1,047 million).
Her rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The 5-km tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast became the closest opportunity for SeAcion to sit in this country as a construction and concessional remote undertaking.
The Council has before it has a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After the selection of public-private cooperation (PPP according to the original English) for further development of the project in the business plan protected by Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and implementation of the project.
It is expected that tenders will be submitted in May and the proposed investment will amount to $1,700 million (EUR 1,047 million) and in the last phase of the competition three companies with significant presence in European buildings.
The group called Transcity is led by Actiona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies and the second with its residence in Italy is one of the largest European specialists on the ground.
Against the Action Group, the Group of Northern Direct is in the game with British Laing O'Rourke, Australian Infrastructure Manager Transfield and the French Construction Group Bouygues.
The third and last group, which has passed the network, has the name LBRJV and shares the Australian capital Leighton (the daughter of the construction company Hochtief, represented by ACS), as well as the local Baulderstone (ownership of the German Bilfinger Berger) and a major company specializing in Razel’s civil buildings.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great construction and privatization, but it is not a clear difficulty to enter in a way other than through the acquisition of local construction companies.
In addition to Asian references, the strategies referred to by Hochtif or Bilfinger are still examples of Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS gained market position through its 30% share in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton quoted company.
Millions of assets
The action is based on the geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector in which it is already important to be involved through its energy suppliers' activities and in the retail trade.
In addition to the other assets, there is the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and leads a group of companies that set up and repair the relief facility in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use joint energy for access to the building and infrastructure.
The underground road that lies below the meth of the city of Brisbane, called the Northern Link, is connected to the western side of Toowong with the road around Kelvin Grove (see map) within 5 km of the tunnel. It is the largest action to reduce the traffic over Brisbane.
The schedule of local government plans for 2010 and the start of work on December of the following year.
Although this pleasant journey would be open in the last months of 2014, the full completion of the work is planned until 2016.
The tunnel began to project in 2005.
It will contain two holes in each direction, an electronic mesh system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane has already offered this order Hochtief
Australia continues to make a significant profit because yesterday it announced a contract with the government estimated to be 154 million.
The shared ACS provides its local Leighton branch infrastructure for the national network of wide-band cable from the optical train.
This situation allows for fast access to the Internet to 400,000 people and provides work to German companies for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company abandoned King George's building project of 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work had to begin first and Hochtief closed the sale of 129 million.
In Britain, specifically in Manchester, Laing O'Rourke will participate in the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC has been allocated a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, received the allocation of a tunnel building of 2.1 km for the distance in Slovenia of EUR 64.5 million.
The company received a contract a few days after work on the expansion of the tunnel in Bosruck (Rakowso) for 130 million.
This way Alpine strengthens its experience in building tunnels.
The start of work is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and the duration of implementation is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore got a promotion in Renfe.
Renfe has provided advertising and marketing services in the last two years by Ms. Rushmore's agency for about three million euros a year, informing the railway company.
The contract contains the possibility of extending for 12 months each year. Ms. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies represented in the race by Renfe, from which four of them came to the end, among which TBWA was responsible for making advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be looking after the design and production of the campaign.
63 million for France Télécom to boost competition
The regulatory authority for competition in France has imposed EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean, which belongs to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition between fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programmes being used at the end of the regulation.
This former French monopoly and the state company has been buying more than EUR 560 million since 1994 to prevent its competitors.
The case lodged yesterday was raised by de facto because the competition authority is considered to have allowed France Télécom a similar offence as in the past and thus to be reciprocity.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile side is still a star between other operators and has opened up internet applications to increase revenue that will not result from voice transfers.
From the start, trade with Orange applications will be active in France and Great Britain.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for entry into other countries such as Spain.
The game in the Champions League has brought 476.4 million Madrid and Barce from the beginning
The League of Masters has been a source of income for these clubs since its origin in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have been making 476.4 million since then, one of them makes the third and the fifth most educational club in competition.
The list looks like Manchester United.
The list looks like Manchester United.
To win the UEFA League of Masters does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for the large club.
To that end, the competition divided EUR 5,362.5 million between 105 companies (of which 12 Spanish) participated from the origin of the tournament in 1992/1993, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona came out of this department very well.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money he had received, and the only one with AC Milan who won three times the main price.
The present Catalan champion and the final victory of the lost Pohar Europe in 1992 is in the fifth category.
The list is led by Manchester United and Minichov Bayern, two companies that also counted the most money to participate in the past Lise masters.
And it's even though she lost both of them with Barço.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country that won the most money through the Championships, although it won the most title of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distributor
This seeming paradox is explained by a complex procedure for the distribution of the money used by UEFA.
In this accounting year, the authority that Michel Platini presides is planning to make 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of these UEFA funds, 413.1 million is paid on a fixed basis: each of the 20 clubs participating in the pre-classification car (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition to those who attended, only 3.8 million were held for their presence, other than 550,000 euros for each game that participates.
There is also a prize for winning (800,000 euros) and for winning (400,000 for each company). Eight finalists will get three million each; eight quarter finalists 3.3 million.
Each of the last four gets 4 million.
It's 9 million champions, while the second finalist is 5.2 million.
This will make a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Barça, on the other hand, won 2.5 million for victory in the European superpower in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments for 337.8 million.
This money is divided according to the relative values of each television market.
Spain is one of the main places and has four designated places.
The year-long champion will get 40% of the assigned money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid in accordance with the number of events that take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
The Nueva Rumas Group published yesterday the details of the offer of buying stock with which it wants to get a top place between 25% and 29,9% of the capital Sos.
This percentage is not required to make public tenders for purchases (optional) of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 for shares that would be paid in ten years and for which it would pay the rate for this discount1% annually.
Yesterday's share Sos finished trading at €1.85; so the offer Nueva Rumas evaluates the company by 18% under market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa price 1,50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Council.
The group of Jerezsk provides a 15-day period to inform shareholders of their interest in selling the stock.
The CMMV claimed that it was not informed of the offer, although Ruize Matease confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would be 611.7 million, while the capitalisation of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, he continues to change the structure of his conduct.
As an attempt to keep up with possible offers for purchases and balance the judicial performance of his former brothers, Jesus and Jaime Salazars, the choice of Mary Luisy Jordá as head of the internal audit was announced.
This decision shall be made by the first woman who has a high role in the food business.
It is a new establishment that will be directly subject to the group's president.
And it is not surprising because the company is still involved in the legal battle on data transfer over 230 million of Sos's brothers Salazar.
De facto cannot draw up the possibility that in the coming months Sos will release new funds
As regards Salazar's credit yesterday, the former members of the Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (the representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) told the National Court that they had approved 212 million transfers without knowing where they were assigned.
CMMV allows options for the exclusion of the Parent who participated Inversora Mer
yesterday, the National Commission for the Market of Precious Papers (CNMV) granted an exemption by Inversora Mer against Federica Paterinov on 9 October.
The supervisory authority explained that it allowed this operation, since it understood that its conditions were in accordance with the applicable standards and that it was deemed to be "sufficient" to clarify the contents of the brochures submitted after the amendments made on 2 December.
The CMMV explained that the offer was aimed at acquiring 550,008 shares of the Federica Pateriny at EUR 7,65 per share price, representing 8,95% of the company's capital created by 6,142,786 shares accepted for the sale of butter in Madrid and Bilbao.
It further explained that 5,592.778 million shares were withdrawn, which would not be able to be transferred in any way until the tender was closed which specified that the price was fixed by the Federic Paterin under the provisions of the applicable standards.
New car rating tools
These days, the storm and disaster are not just self-services.
Each day, thousands of cars that have suffered a certain event are withdrawn from the service where the expert must calculate damages and repair costs.
No reliable event is the same as calculating costs for work and working time can be long and complicated.
To calculate the cost of repairs from 20,000 to 30,000 euros, including parts and labour forces, can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, this would be a minute question.
That's why nearly 100% of researchers use this type of system.
The providers of services and solutions for calculating certain events and maintenance shall be entrusted with the collection of information provided by manufacturers to develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain Audatax, from the American Solar Group is a leading company; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of assessment and information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Work with data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, the Managing Director of Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 producers and importers and each provides information in another format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to grow, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been introduced in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
Once a new vehicle enters the market, these companies start working.
It's a very hot job because every one of the thousands of parts of the vehicle needs to be catalogued and set its price.
In addition to each model, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out, where it is possible to "swift" individual parts of tourist vehicles.
With regard to the model with massive sales, work can be ready for a week if the process is very fast.
In the case of a minority car, it may take three or four months. At present, Audadex has full information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models with information are Porsche, but for example not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the railway park, they exceed 99%.
For documentation and development of the database, Audadex has eight mediums distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each specializes in specific features.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics) working with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are collected and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this inconsistencies of information allows businesses to use and supply different products.
The most common use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to individual countries there are also tools to manage replacement parts or to calculate the sales or maintenance values of the car.
The only company that has a guide that informs the value of vehicles used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audadex is not offering it in our country, but in the United States it is.
With a view to products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get support that professionals can use in the sector.
This company offers ten different instruments, including the star product AudaPlus, the standard solution for assessing the reliable events for the researcher.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the costs of the parts, it shall also include time for correction calculated by the manufacturer or by the cook.
This tool shall be paid for each assessment.
The highest price is €5.75 for customers who use it at least 10 times a month.
Then every insurance that carries out thousands of estimates will compare its price with Audadex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow for the full identification of vehicles and devices with which they have come from the assembly line only on the basis of the first number of vehicles.
AudaGlass focuses on the glass of vehicles and AudaSubastas is an open service to the online professional sector, which allows for the production of vehicles with overall security.
His statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analysis or detecting deviations by character or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models have passed through the service due to accidents or how many serious events have taken place over a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
In addition, Gt Estimate sells, which is also intended for researchers and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official production times.
Gt Motive is a company of Innsa based in 1971 as a service provider and a solution to the assessment of damages, accidents or maintenance of cars
Gt Guia evaluation is her reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3,100 founders and 53 insurance companies.
The volume of turnover increased by 20% annually in the last three years and increased by EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of the long year, the process of internationalization of the installation of the office in Paris began.
Audadex was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to the resources of the company, 62% of her brother is responsible for Europe and 38% for North and South America. He works with 900 insurance and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The World Billing of Solar Group (Audatex, Sidex, Informationex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) is $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, our company is making 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than the lotion.
In 2005, Solera's group stood at $1,000 million and now its share is estimated at $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been landed on the bridge in New York and is included in the reference index Standard & Poor's.
Internet transport of hazardous vehicles
In October Solera group bought AutoOnline, an Internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after a certain event.
The operation proposed a reduction of EUR 59.5 million from 85% of the company's capital, which could increase by 15% next year.
The objective of the purchase was to provide more services with added value to customers with access to the international wholesale market.
This assessment and purchase and sale service is exclusively managed by professionals in the sector such as insurance, researchers, loans, services, sales of replacement parts and professional sellers who have to register before the start of the operation.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and runs more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, from 500,000 in Germany.
The main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The Web currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 buyers.
It handles 3,000 daily inserates and adds about 100 new inserates every day to the Spanish market.
According to Spanish law, the number of vehicles whose number of vehicles has been declared cannot be returned to service but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with a historical value may be allowed to operate even if they have been ordered after pre-treatment.
Number of services in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user will only receive a budget in four steps: identification of vehicles, search for work, creation of a budget for budget generation.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, in particular for the convincement of senior professionals who are more or less sustainable in the use of new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles including 666, 109 terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 supplies and 44 trucks.
A computer is needed for use with Internet connection.
After the identification of the model to be repaired using the number of the vehicle, a real graphic display of the model shall be displayed and then the required replacement parts shall be selected.
The user may include variable labour costs, charges or discounts and then print and pass on to customers.
AudaTaller is not an AudaPlus rating tool, although you are a reference directory.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is focusing on the service and does not include the calculation of the labour force.
The costs for the use of this instrument for sharing are EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
At the present time, the company Audatex is working to ensure that this view is three-dimensional.
This is the innovation that the mechanics welcome because it is possible, for example, to choose a door and turn it around to take the inner side.
