People's right triumph in Austria, together is 29%
The early elections in the Austrian Parliament have brought together according to the first close results, a significant weakening of both parties of the current great coalition and an express strengthening of the People's Right Party.
A number of strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (ODP), where the position of current President, Wilhelm Moreer, is seriously undermined.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), Head of the Government of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing his tripal return to national policy.
According to the results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with a 29.8 per cent vote, thus losing a 5.5 per cent vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still, the ODP has ended up losing 25.6 per cent, almost nine per cent of the votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the postwar war and especially for the populace who convened these earlier elections.
In early July, when the ODP emerged from the coalition, the populace had a considerable advantage in relation to preference to the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for allowing the Government to sail.
Already in the first response to the results there were speculations about the resignation of the party's president and, to date, vice-canceller, Wilhelm Moreer.
Observers believe that this could be achieved this Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party's presidency.
This development would clearly facilitate the path of the constant and closer starting point of electoral results, namely the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and ODP.
In view of the fact that the strengthening of both parties to the populist right - the Liberals (FPO) have won about 18 per cent and the BZO, 11 per cent of the votes - and that social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that it would be repeated in 1999 when the populists negotiated with the populists (then the FPO was a unit, but in 2005 BZO resigned) for a coalition government that had come to generate a penalty by the European Union.
This evolution clearly identifies Haider who has already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he has already taken his return to Vienna, to national policy.
The Green Party has also been able to reach Parliament although it has lost slightly and declined from the third to the fifth position between the Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly exceeded the limit of four hundred and therefore is not part of Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India can be frozen
If it is not possible to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India for illicit collection of scarabs, there could be a worsening of Czech-India relations, according to the Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This was demonstrated by the Minister in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this would not be solved then yes, then yes, it would be safe to arrive at this comfort," he said after the meeting organized by Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters it can be difficult to get the executive involved.
However, it was stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was free of charge and punished with a fine, the government could negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter was dealt with.
"Your problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kuchera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest courts.
Then you can request the exoneration of the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"It is advisable to appeal to the Supreme Court and then it would be possible for the guilty," the Czech diplomat chief said.
The only way to get into the matter is by getting the defendant a "legal competent support", the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support was already received by the Indian party.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg commented.
On the other hand, as the ČTK said, his colleague insisted that the Czech Republic considered the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a terrible mistake to jail and condemn these Czech scientists," he announced.
The Minister gave the answer to the question whether he had received the promise to deal with the matter from the Indian side.
"I've got enough promises," he just found.
A Czech archipelago is a fight in the bottom of the sea
I'm about an electronic wall map, which represents Australia surrounded by sea.
He does not care, however, about the continent but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it is also the marine fund that surrounds it.
At the same time, the region is as large as one continent," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosouosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the United Nations Division for Ocean and Sea Law.
Her head, Director of the Division, Czech attorney Václav Mikulka, continues the exhibition and sometimes complete.
Rule this talent and enthusiasm for work.
The Marine Fund has so far hidden a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Petroleum and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms are still carrying the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The background is larger than the firm ground
Coastal countries have now begun to dispute frequently the new territories under the sea.
According to the United Nations Treaty, these rights were applied in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is essentially what is called the Continental Borde, which is sometimes extended hundreds of miles from the coast of the country.
This has exclusive rights under the Treaty in all the resources of the Continental Board.
"Simply, by Continental Borde is understood as part of the marine fund and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the coast of the sea, and often, to the border of the two hundred miles of sea, that is, a purely economic area," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the delimitation of the outer limits of the Continental Board should be submitted with scientific documentation based on research and measures.
This is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal assistance committee.
The Commission has so far dealt with five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the three last countries mentioned have gone out," adds Mikulka.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a global impact as it was the first major expansion of its maritime domain.
However, it was also achieved by New Zealand - the seabed surface that gave the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, that is, almost six times more than the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pain in their study.
The gains learned from the use of the marine fund will be, as they promise, invaluable.
Other states are also making few requests.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the Montego Bay Treaty.
There, where the Continental Board ends, the region of the ocean fund declared by the Treaty as "common heritage of humanity".
Now here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right to exploitation in these areas is governed by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The marine fund, however, is no gold mine," said Director Mikulka with emphasis, adding "that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and their regime defined by contract."
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the marine fund belongs also to the Czech Republic.
It is divided with other countries of the then East Block within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a treaty as investors as well as other small states, called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to operate in the area of ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the islands of Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to investigate by the investor is something bigger than the old Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is an accident, it's about something as well as a marine Replica of the Tatras.
"A total extension of 75,000 square kilometres can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete floors containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concrete.
It reminds us of a little patata or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived Golem.
During the liberation of the hostages, the command of the German special forces was at the scene of action
The Government of Egypt had asked for assistance from Germany to resolve the crisis of hostages. The experts came.
When the situation became serious, the command of special forces was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are available on the conditions of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the rescue action, German special forces also participated indirectly.
Therefore, in the place of release, the German army specialists as well as GSG 9, the federal police aircraft squadron, the Federal Criminal Investigation Office, were also experts in the logistics of the technical welfare institution.
As ministers reported on Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, taking account of violent liberation, left their prisoners and fled.
The Government of Egypt accepted aid from Germany to use it as support in the area.
" Fortunately it didn't come at that time," said a spokesman from the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On September 19, in the south of Egypt, the settlers had kidnapped a group of 5 German, 5 Italian, a Romanian, and 8 Egyptian accompanying them.
After the kidnapping in the desert region of southern Egypt to the Rhines they deported them from one side to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers was unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible redemption payments.
While both healthy and safe people came to Cairo.
Steinmeier said the liberated reins were under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't say a word about the details of the liberation.
At first there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the "Build" newspaper, 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from Germany's air forces and arrive to Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives does not approve the rescue package
The first camera of the United States Congress failed with a large savings package of $700 billion for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very badly.
The United States House of Representatives rejected the Government ' s financial markets package with 227 votes against 206.
Despite all the calls by President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties, the majority of the programme was not reached with which the gap in the financial markets should be limited.
With a dramatic action, desperate defenders have still tried to convince critics to accept the large $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the democratic negotiations had asked Members to vote even though the plan is not so popular.
"It is difficult to get political approval to avoid something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
Already during the vote, the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 per cent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors who could fail the State rescue package.
The vote was suspended at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, it fell again.
Experts have other serious disturbances in international financial markets.
To allow the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the volume of sales of travel reservations for the next few months increased compared with last year - even the winter season in more than 30 per cent.
According to one study, despite the weakened community the desire to travel from Germany remains as before.
As reported on the month of the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, travel agencies recorded a volume of sales that is 31 per cent more than compared to the same period last year.
According to the investigation by the GfK Market Research Institute, reserves for the months of autumn had already risen in number.
Thus the volume of sales of travel agencies in October was almost 11 per cent more than in 2007, reported the DVR.
The results base are GfK's figures that are the information analyzed on reservations in 1200 travel agencies and which are computerized around the market.
The data collected are the travel reservations made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened rate of the dollar over all travel to the United States, there is a great demand, the DRW reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased almost to a third.
The preferred destination points of the Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also Germany's regions.
Most of all organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, travel costs are "better for the customer than during an individual journey".
Among other things, consumers can save money with advance booking discounts or All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the travel was well reserved, so that the volume of sales compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip, compared to last year, fell.
My first Octoberfest
The hits of the festivals under the sky open in the endless Balneario, the beer in leaves of a litre and the famous people dressed in traditional wedding garments by designers.
A start in a campaign shop.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She's a thief, the television moderater, and she wears a traditional beer dress.
I have dark color hair, I'm a student and my dress is already used.
But there's one thing that unites us: we're just in a campaign shop, the photographers have already stepped up to us and filled out their memory cards with the photos - it's very lisonier especially because I'm the first time in Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap beer dress seems to fulfill its function.
In fact, as a tourist in Octoberfest from northern Germany, my feeling of well-being with a traditional beer dress up to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Terrace Prado it's not that much.
Almost everyone wears traditional cow clothing or leather pants; no one seems to be giving up or feeling uncomfortable - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my front desk receives rare views on the side of a flat stand in chocolate.
A munique calls my attention to my front which I had dressed in wrong manner: "The left side is lonely, the middle is the virgin, on the right side is compromised, behind it is married."
Oh, my God, now I'm going back to the left.
"All right," he says laughing.
The others don't worry about many subtle methods to flirt and carry gors where it's written "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking them, their naked ass.
A young boy who behaves as an exhibitionist is called Bob, who is from England and is also the first time in Octoberfest.
He looks like "gorgeous", which he says with a very long "o".
I count it after putting his glass of beer on the side of him who just had to drink.
I put it right next to the fire door, most think it's an empty cube.
Then Bob is one of the famous people who know a lot about drinking.
Others are not very lucky and cannot consume so much alcohol.
About eight o'clock in the night, health groups run for the party place and have to worry about poor drinks.
Sanitarys appear each time in group - suddenly there are four people who carry coverts from one camp shop to another.
It works like most visitors: They get drunk, they get drunk.
You don't see who suffers from alcohol levels and is on the streets.
"They're those who can't do it anymore," said a nurse in reply to my question and disappeared in anguish.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
The 63-year-old peton he fell into the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in the Essex County.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that took place in Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under the suspicion of ill-treatment.
Since then, he has been set free under finance.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Before Turkey became a member of the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter the country.
In the eastern part of Bósforo, perhaps only 20 steps into Asia, is one of the most interesting remains of the destructive imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-renacentist style.
At least this is what the guides say.
The building is set to clock the end of the platforms and takes before two towers, one for each corner, similar to all a typical German assembly.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a little decadent.
But once the locker was over, there is no doubt about what the size of the company was the most western door.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German Consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a " latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that was cured up to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Her ferret roads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
Due to the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell under
the British rule and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a munitions train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
The Turkish sources commented that it was a Saturday.
Since then the station has been falling down and remained on the edge of history.
But today, this railway, entrance door to Anatolia and all the Eastern centers, it serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's will to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party in the Government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new policy of cooperation.
The Turkish Government maintains an excellent relationship with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah, Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went to a letter and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, with the aim of visiting one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten hours and a half later - after a journey of sacudas, which produced the fates of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, came to the Turkish capital - a new city, thought to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in the Turkish consensus
which has raised some suspicions in the West and, in particular, in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a development suburban, surrounded by medium-sized commercial centres and "power pastries" where middle-class managers in business - men and women - meet at the first hour of the morning to agree/business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was anomaly," he says.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the same time towards the East and the West.
This is not a case if it's not towards one or the other.
You have to do both things.
"But certainly at some point," I asked him, "would Turkey be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he replied, "I don't want to make that choice."
He then emphasized that almost everyone I have talked to so far had almost recalled me: the relations Turkey has not only with the Middle East but with the Caucasus region, and with all the Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my mind goes back to the two German ladies, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised would it be to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East, in large part, would be at the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting for the terminal the Ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I agree that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
There are not many doubts, then, which will be the continent to which this fascinating country should be requisitioned.
Memories: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: who was the music director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (as at 11 September) was responsible for the Philharmonic Orchestra of Guildford and the Coro.
As part of the city's musical project, the following year its magnificent choir of young people, Proteus, was founded.
It was supposed to be for the under 21 years, but when Proteus sang his final song in 1979, several of us were just 20 years old - we just refused to give it to the heart.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological variable of forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music that is present to him, whether it is magical or Messiah, whether it is not accompanied or full orchestrated.
The musical versatility produced by this young heart was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to that man's inspiration and enthusiasm for music that continued to be absolutely constant over the years.
Often everything told us to "let music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there in music.
That's all I have to sing!"
Its variant was always absolutely clear and precise, although never imputable, not too flowery.
Anyone who wasn't playing music, always ended up at an even greater level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been riding, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed – on the contrary, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "selled one or two very well-known war horses around the world."
We're gonna need a lot less.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his century by William Woodruff (September 25, 1946) he said that "in 1946 economic history studies were resumed in Oxford and in 1950 he won a scholarship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a degree title, one of master and one of doctors."
This is learned in a note by Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, during which he completed a doctoral thesis on the British coal industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
It took years between 1950 and 51 years in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman Bay, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to pass this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flame and Life" because his photographs in white and black, documental style are fantastic.
They called me attention to your simplicity and the force they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to catch magical moments."
Second rise for Honda supervents
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor had already counted on a large housing area, this new monovolume presents an even wider internal space.
However, there are refined mechanisms, which increase the comfort of driving and allow for more fuel storage.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz presents a very similar line to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, it should indicate an innovative design, a new platform, larger sizes and new mechanisms.
However, before analysing the new model, it must be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation was introduced into the market.
Therefore, one first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter period than the one employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, where Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Exactly in Japan, about a million jazz units have been sold since their launch.
The second market has been the Continental Old Age, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda expects this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007, the Japanese firm marketed a total of 83,000 jazz units, in 2009, estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would suggest an increase of 17 per cent in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda sales in Spain.
With regard to the new generation, the Spanish branch officials expect to sell 2,000 jazz units in a complete year.
Exactly the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to scale to a large extent the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand managers expect the year to end with a total of 22,000 commercialised units, which means 4,000 less than in 2007, a decrease of 16 per cent.
Despite this increase in Honda sales, its market share in Spain has increased by 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm is also expected to achieve 2% in 2010.
To achieve this Honda quota trusts the arrival of another new model.
This is the Insight, a hybrid of five doors and compact size - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company expects to commercialise around 200,000 units a year around the world.
By markets and according to estimates by the Japanese manufacturer, 50 per cent of the sales of Insight will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The market launch of the Insight is expected for the first months of the year, once its presentation is held in society in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its coats.
Its length rises to 3,90 metres (five inches more), its width to 1,69 meters (two inches more) and its distance between axles to 2,50 meters, which means an increase of five inches.
The height, in turn, did not vary and remained at 1.52 metres.
Along with increasing sizes, it also increases internal habitat.
This is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of a central fuel deposit, a solution also adopted in the former Jazz.
Also, the male capacity - which has a double base system - rises to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the female capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measures are version with engine 1.4, since Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as rear ladders or the possibility of mounting the panoramic crystal - is an improvement in access to rear seats.
And it's that the doors that give access to the second row present an 80-degree opening angle in front of the 67-degree first Jazz.
There are also new engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will have two gasoline propellers of 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves a lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refining and at the same time achieves a high pair throughout the engine system.
The first 1,2 litre mechanism has a power of 90 horses to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum of 114 Nm. to 4,900 rounds.
This propeller - which previously reached 78 horses - presents a cost of 5.3 litres and some 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
With regard to the previous propeller, which in the previous generation had earned 83 horses, it is now going to have 100.
This Jazz 1.4 out of 100 horses achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'beautiful car' that avoids collisions
To advance technology development for the prevention of Nissan accidents, it has been inspired this time, in nature, in particular, in the bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking as a basis the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which assumes the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers from Nissan Advanced Technical Centre Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development, BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan's four-area security shield.
This robot aims to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicle.
During their flight, each bee creates its own personal space in an oval manner that looks very much like the Nissan Security Squad.
But most important are the eyes of the bee, able to see with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To enjoy this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a laser locater (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles that are up to two metres away within a 180 degree radius before the BR23C, calculates the distance up to that object and sends a signal to a microprocessor of approach which, immediately, is translated into the prevention of collision.
"When you detect an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels into straight angle or larger to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasion manoeuvre is completely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot move up or down, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like the bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and acceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It is not necessary to store information or intuitive logic of previous manoeuvres, so it can work continuously with only a couple of dozens of KB memory.
This may surprise us, but we're not talking about memory gigas, or even memes."
This is the first step towards developing new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan vaccines will introduce into serial cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on the way.
Time before mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Treasure Department, in addition to having very liquid to do injections, is not lacking in engineering.
Before the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from embarking on empty mortgages in challenging settlement banks, they have created a threat and information game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
Either the "Hotel of Bad Credits" or the lakes.
The theoretical aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think about one, two and three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, what is probably your goal.
True, it has useful information, but not very detailed.
It is more a page for adolescents than a place for all the public.
What happens if the game is completed?
Because there's a bathroom inside the hotel.
Something's something, because if we buy a better house or we don't talk...
Morgan Stanley sells participation to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced his entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will pay nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong low rate of its cash.
A week after a provisional agreement had been concluded, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's regular shares at a unit price of $25.25, or a amount of $3,000 million.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a 10 % return and a $31,25 conversion price.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global operation would be carried out at a price per unit of $29, or 28 per cent above its current change.
Morgan Stanley's action, however, was 6.79 per cent to 23.07 dollars per person at 1700 GMT.
" This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the status of banking," explained Juan Mack, director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but he does pass under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's largest names to adopt a much more prudent behaviour than before.
The modalities presented last month also show that the agreement has been amended during the last days: last month, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, he explained to Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, " we thought that participation had been made up only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover them."
Taking into account the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its securities to Morgan Stanley 7% below its accounting value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of about 20 % of the benefit by action.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert within one year half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares if they are sold by more than 50 % above the conversion price, or at $47 more or less during a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that MUFG's capital will allow him to take investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
A group spokesman, however, refused to comment on the strategic drafts of the two new allies.
Following the investment in MUFG, Morgan Stanley should show a settlement ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan needed to ease his balance a lot since the end of August.
The last few weeks were overwhelming for the group, which saw its rate in bags down to half while the cost of security against a risk of defects over its debt disappeared.
This cost was delayed last month but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "survivor" of Wall Street's big investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's purchase, announced that he had raised $15,000 in part for Berkshire Hataway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this is Monday.
Refund the republic around socialism of the 21st century.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, for example from your colleagues and friends, was the third to vote on a draft for a new constitution.
The mission was carried out as 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results referring to 80% of the suffrage.
According to these results, the "no" received 28%, 7% of the suffrages were zero votes and 0.7% were white.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, half of the suffrage should be obtained.
On Sunday, two polls from electoral centres and a non-governmental organization report had announced a wide victory to "yes", estimated between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on Sunday night on Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The " Constitution has emerged dramatically " , it has been ensured, welcoming Ecuadorans headed by the government of Guayaquil to 280 kilometers south of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chavez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Michela Bachelet.
The elections, to be held in full peace, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), were referred to a text of 444 points that strengthened the " new socialism " defended by the President.
The draft Constitution implies an increase in State power over the economy by reservesing the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the foreign currency that sends its migrants.
The project, which was elected by Korea in 2006, also grants strengthened powers to the Head of State, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year mandates each and will have the possibility of dissociating the Assembly.
Korea had already announced that it would use this power and would require a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of the freedom of health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country 13.9 million people, with 50 per cent of the population living under the poverty threshold.
The ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end in the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 kidnapped persons have been released in Chad.
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the rapists of the eleven tourists and their eight followers captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived in Egypt's capital after the moon was set free in the afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by the special Egyptian forces in Chad.
All of them had a good look at their arrival at 1530 on a special plane at the Al-Maza military base, adjacent to El Cairo International Airport.
Some helicopters immediately transported them to the hospital of Maadi, a residential suburban of El Cairo, to be subjected to medical tests, so they were unable to speak to the press.
"There are good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On 19 September, they fell into the power of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a Safari in all lands in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and from then on they passed from one to another.
The group was composed of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Egyptian travel agency, under the organization of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, transported on board two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night before the Alba.
" An exchange of shots occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others had fled," said the officer who preserved the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "relampago" unit were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commands.
In Belgrade, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"It must be acknowledged that we have achieved this result through professionalism and the effectiveness of our men of the secret services, of the special forces," he said without entering into details.
He also reduced the payment of a ransom.
The former Sudanese army claimed that during a patrol an entire field on which the kidnappers were found, of which six were killed, the head of Chadian and two were arrested.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unit Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a statement immediately rejected by this group.
Letter - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is taking place on manchettes and is taking place in the current electoral campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will rise up to claim the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that die of hunger?
What policy will be taken to remind the federal government of its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don't we have real laws that actually preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did I know that the French government spent three and a half million euros to restore China’s castle in the valley of Loira?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of the heritage is part of the culture of the United States and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Historical societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers regrouped into 211 historical, heritage, archives and genetic societies are concerned about searching in history, saving with little money from private archives and preserving archaeological research.
These are often the shepherds of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and responsible fire their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
For when, is a monument for history and heritage?
The Governments of the Netherlands nationalize part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with nationalisation to the Belgian- Dutch bank Fortis, which is seen in the aftermath of the crisis in the North American market: the three countries will fully support this financial and insurance institution which also has business in Hungary.
At the end of this week, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held consultations at a higher level with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission responsible for economic competition.
Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the euro area crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has occurred in several oils over a year ago, so decisions taken with respect to the Bank can in some sense be considered as previous.
According to the decision taken on Sunday afternoon, the three States will purchase approximately half (49 per cent) of the property owned by the Bank in its area.
The Bank will certainly sell part of its business, including in particular the activities - mainly insurance - purchased last year by the Dutch A BN Amró.
Fortis' actions began a strong decline last week and for the second half of the week important signs of crisis were already seen in the institution.
However, analysts agree to point out that with its 85 000 employees this Bank is too large to allow it to rest.
The company's actions on Friday only decreased by 12 percent, which is the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January the value of the actions has decreased by more than two thirds.
Noting the current stock prices, the total value of the group's capital on the market is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company's executives this is not real.
The Bank's management imposed the collapse of Fortis' actions on the security of the North American market in relation to the adoption of the US package plan of 700 billion dollars.
Months of action have already shown a slight increase.
Friday they appointed Filip Dierckx as the new director general of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but no one has so far given a specific offer.
The Belgian government had already ensured that investors had no reason to worry, they would not lose their money.
There has been no panic among the Bank's customers so far, they have not invaded bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased lease companies.
Blue in the Gallin
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract when they see the purchase data.
Privacy policy experts fear that the market for personal data will become uncontrollable.
"There are personal data protection programmes, which in all cases lead to the approval of the person given.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, we "trust the gallinary to the iron" - quote the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the follow-up program for medical prescriptions.
Insurance companies rely on the price of insurance and the amount of compensation of the customer's health status and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
They previously sent the client to medical control and signed the contract with him knowing the results of the control.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer's identification number, the list of medicines bought in the last year and in the middle of the year and the program itself is getting the customer's disease and health status.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of pills to reduce cholesterol, it indicates that the blood fat level is practically inaccurately high, thus being included immediately in a higher risk category.
There are many versions of the programme, some even establish a number of risks, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has only something to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the programme's disadvantages, for example, some medicines are multi-use, for example certain substances are used to treat headaches as well as heat waves and even antidepressants.
This latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the first ones are not.
Special companies were established to consult and process these data, which, before receiving the necessary information from medicines, requested the patient's approval.
The authorities are already obliged to do so, although they have not received any compensation for the neglect so far.
Some companies have also recently developed the results of laboratory tests and combined them with drug consumption data to obtain more detailed information on the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to these data and at the same time it is increasingly difficult to control their use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but only applies to insurance companies and health services.
The Congress has already before it the draft law which provides the authority for the control of specialised companies for the provision of personal data.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: so he developed his programme, which will require the person's specific approval for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot refuse his approval, because unless the insurance companies sign the contract with him.
So gallins, despite all, are exposed to the good will of the bear.
Marsella's Global Menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
Since the European Union and India are mutually commercial partners, this issue in addition to other global problems dominated the order of the day of the ninth summit.
A French-Indian summit will also be held today, mainly on nuclear energy cooperation.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic development power that should have more votes and votes on international issues, Member States have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit launched yesterday in Marsella.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU turn-over President José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana, Chief Representative of Foreign Policy, received Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister with whom they reached a five-year agreement to double in five years, i.e. an increase of over EUR 1 billion, their trade exchange.
Given that the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an extremely ambitious objective.
Thus they legally harmonised the twenty-second civil aviation bilateral agreements with India, so that air transport can also fly in the future.
India wishes to sign the free trade treaty with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The objective is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only in the ninth place between the Union's trading partners.
The summit gave its attention to global issues.
Both sides condemned the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism - all forms of it - and urged the convening of a United Nations conference.
The conclusion of the Doha Trade Liberalization Round was also appreciated, although both parties had a great responsibility for their failure.
The EU confirmed its energy and climate programme, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce pollution emissions by at least twenty percent.
India also agrees with this, just as the next year's climate conference should reach a global agreement and reduce by 2050 the production of greenhouse gases by 50 per cent.
They also wanted to hamper the increase in food prices and supported the call for an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that the French companies will receive jobs of EUR 28 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian editors
Strong presence of Italian editors in the international sample of the book of Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian editors will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International sample of the book of Frankfurt is expected for this edition of more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries who will occupy 171,790 square metres of the sample with more than 403,000 titles in exhibition and with Turkey as a guest of honor.
He will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Property and Cultural Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government at the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with an Italian point - 264 square metres of exhibition space.
A press meeting will follow with the press in Room Structure at Buchmesse’s 5.0 flag: this will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives on the status of editors in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign authors' books gradually decreases over the total Italian production, in particular for adults and adolescents.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the millionaire disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane has been found, the millionaire disappeared on 3 September 2007 while flying over the wilderness of Nevada.
The caves have been found on an altitude of 3,000 metres, in the area of the Mammoth Lakes Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
There were no human remains inside the plane.
Commissioner Madera County, John Anderson, has identified the doubts that remained: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that this is about what Steve Fossett was flying the day of his disappearance" said at a press conference.
The Commissioner has stated that no human remains have been found on or around the plane.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been put to death in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) has informed that a few hours after the landing of the remains, a team of researchers who identified the device: Bellanca 8kcab itself was deployed since 3 September 2007, when Fossett fired Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada confin, some of Fossett's personal remains have been found by a couple near his Mammoth Lakes home.
It is two documents on the name of Fosset, the two issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash in cash and a subsidiary.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a role in history thanks to a long series of prizes.
In 2002, the sixth attempt had turned into the first Man to complete the world's turn into an aerostic globe: two single weeks of flight.
Three years later the world was turned into a plane and without stairs.
Among its records, it may also have flew up to 15445 meters high over the Andes, but with a doll.
Glak, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv out of the schemes with an original design and well established with defined lines and angles.
This is, in synthesis, glk the last born among truckers all over the land "compacts" of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a news window in this sector.
Subject to the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and non-conventional, the communication accompanying the launch of the south glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz exhibition rooms since next 17 October.
The advertising campaign accompanying the start of the new car launchs an independent communication mode through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi posters, which was discussed in three different phases, which dominated the central street of Milanese shopping, Avenue Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special gloves distributed on the Avenue How it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images will have the impression that the car goes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina8 the new glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be compensated in a single image.
Without any doubt Mercedes with this publicity is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automobile communication.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers? We will see.
is clear who are the Italian hooligans
In the Trivenet, there is a ban on access to sports events.
But who are these 150-200 girls and girls of which Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Others Italian" group that has been following the Italian National for years and that has so far, in fact, never created too many problems.
And they never met the rival fanatics either.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These from Sofia have been collected into a small group (a few units, in fact) of the Campania and Apulia.
They have flags of three colors where the city of origin of the soldiers appears: Saturday night they have been taken out so they can't be identified.
They're inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of Levski.
The Figc had made available 144 Italian fans for the party: all already with the names, which are easily controlled.
And the Minister of the Interior had already controlled them all: among those who had gone out to Sofia there was no one with a Daspo (a ban on access to sports events) at that time, no one had prevented him from attending a stadium.
Four Italian fanatics, who had formerly been criminal in stadiums, rejected the ticket and also the trip.
The Ministry of the Interior is now waiting to read the acts from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo (a ban on access to sports events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo (a ban on access to sports events) which prevents not only Italian stadiums but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans won't stand any longer at a stadium.
Good luck!
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others are added.
"We must immediately close this fire and not legitimize who behaves this way," they support the Ministry of the Interior.
Therefore, "open eye" particularly in view of the Lecce National Wednesday Party".
In Apulia there is also a small nucleus of Ultras Italia supporters.
Tomorrow, the Observatory will meet on Tuesday, the Cams which can also be included with an Aise section (external information and security agency, i.e. the secret service, which deals with problems at the stadiums itself.
"Do the hearts of Duce-Duce and the raised arm during Mameli's smile? In Bulgaria it is not a reality ...."
This is the thought (expressed in a slightly happy way) of Domenico Mazelli, director of the Ministry of the Interior (has taken the position previously taken by Francesco Tagliente and then by Felice Ferrizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste of public security where there is a nucleus of support from the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not difficult to celebrate the Duke but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics who have been ashamed.
"I do not make sociologist – add Observer No.1 – the reactions are attributed to the countries in which the fact occurs.
So far this group has been well behaved now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But we're also talking about the silhouettes to Mameli's hymn: they're also not a reality, but if they're not allowed to be educational..."
