I'd like to tell you about it later.
Baxtalo!
You're gonna have a cup of tea.
I'm going to make it a storyteller.

But the worst thing to do is to read it.
What then shall they do to him?
Are you sorry about the Internet?
What the hell are you doing?
I only let Tomestar get a camel.
I put Tomester on top of the cards.
I'm making ice cream for Tomes' mother.
I mean, I don't care about Tomesh's mother.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm speaking French less than Tom.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I've advised you that Tom's duty is to do you wrong.
He's got me a pack of woods.
He's got me this pack on Tom's neck with a tie.
And I'm gonna put you on Tom's neck with his throat.
He's got me on this shit, man.
I tried to do it, but Tom gave it up.
But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.
I asked him to let Tom leave me.
I or I'm just calling you Tomes.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
I didn't command him to do this thing.
If I miss you only Toms will regret you.
I was interested in Tom.
To Tomâ€™s surprise.
You've been coloring me or a jealous sarge about Tom.
To hell.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
If I don't know about Tom we're kidding you.
If you're sad about Tom's age.
If I don't care about Tom's sister, she's sad.
If there's no time for Tom's throat tar.
It's just that Toms and I drove you to the wall of your mother's house.
You know, I was just making you a cup of sugar.
I didn't think Tom would come back.
I wonder if you lied to Tom.
I thought Tom was a loser.
I was wondering if Tom would hurt me.
I wonder if you're mad at Tom.
I thought you were Tom's job.
I thought you were Tom's bitch.
I don't know if you're wondering about Tom.
I don't think Tom's been here.
I thought Tom was lying.
I'm gonna call you Tomes if I'm in trouble.
I'll let you go. I'll let you go.
You're an asshole, too.
You're a bitch, you're a bitch.
If thou wilt bind him, tell me.
It's a big body. It's a big body.
I heard Tom was dead.
I'm sorry, Toms gave you a little bit of akathe.
But let's just say I'm going to tell you something.
But I was afraid that Thomas would come to me.
I'm jealous of Tom's love.
I didn't know what Tom was trying to do.
I'm jealous and thinking and I'm simple.
For I know that this is he of whom I said, 'He is like a man who is born in the house of God.'
I don't know Tom at home.
I hope Tom's in Boston.
I was just pretending to fly to Tomes.
I asked for Tom's love.
I wanted Tom to be kidding me.
I know that Tom is doing this now.
For I know that this shall turn out to be so.
For I know that his will is, that, as many as are under the yoke shall carry him under his feet, they shall bear him up.
But I know that it is he which cometh to pass, that I may accuse him of these things.
I want to know what Tom would do.
I don't know what to do with Tom.
I don't know what Tom would do.
You're an old man about Tom. You're not Boston.
I love it, as Tom did.
I'm giving me a place in English.
I prayed for the war of the Cherkans.
I'm surprised Tom's akathe.
I'm either about a woman who's sick or Toms.
Let's have a good time.
But I'm sure Tom likes them.
But I am sure that it will be, even so, that it will turn out well with him.
But I am sure that it will be, even so, that it will turn out well with him.
But I am sure that it will be, even so, that it will be with him.
We're going to let the spirit of light go.
Xasarav's wall is in his head.
Incredible!
But I determined this to send him to you for this very purpose.
But I determined this to command him to come to you shortly.
I was worried about Tom.
I'm worried about Tom's waiting.
I am afraid that now, whatever you will do, I will do.
Interesting.
For I will not dare to speak of any thing except what I will say.
I fled from him, and said to him, 'Don't hold my peace, for I will not return to you.'"
I saw Toms and got off the bus.
But I determined this with myself, that I might know the cause why they were accused.
But I determined this with myself, that I would do it for Thomas.
What are you doing here?
Now I stand here to talk to Thomas.
You don't know about Tom's mother-in-law?
And he charged them that they should do this thing.
I think the English is a little light from Algeria.
I was wondering if you were gay about Tom.
But I think that it is possible for Timothy to be edified.
I was wondering if you'd have to wait for Tom's wedding.
But I think that it is enough for him that a certain man should be counted worthy of him.
I was wondering if you were driving Tom.
I was surprised at Tom you did it.
I was surprised at Tom's very funny.
I was wondering if you were gay about Tom.
But I think that it is good for him to be willing to do it.
But I think that it is enough for him that a certain man should be counted worthy of him.
But I think that it is possible for Timothy to be a widow to me.
But I think that it is good for him that he be ashamed.
But I think that it is possible for Timothy to be edified.
I told Thomas, that I was supposed to speak French.
And I commanded Thomas to come unto him.
I'm telling Tomes that I'm sorry about you.
You've been fucked up by a guy who's an asshole.
Like Tom, you've been able to tell me.
It wasn't Tom who made it.
I'm sorry about Toms. I'm sorry about you.
Let's do it.
I'm going through a lot of trouble.
But I determined this with myself, that I would do it for Thomas.
But I determined this to send him to you for this very purpose.
I'm tired of Tom's gambling me.
And I went to see Thomas, and so did he.
I didn't want to see Thomas.
I will therefore chastise him and release him."
I'm afraid Tom's got me.
But I will come to you when I come.
But I will come to you when I come.
I'm going to tell Tom about the wait.
Whether it be right in my eyes to give it to Thomas.
When he saw Tom's face.
I'm either sick of Toms.
I'll bet Toms' time is late.
That's right.
De Chaga!
Johamno!
Ashun!
Dikh!

Mary, you're an asshole.
Mary said to me, "Tomorrow is the way."
The wall of fen ajutissarta must have made you mad at me like a baby.

Whether about Tom or Mary, let's just have a party ball.
Whether it's Tom or Mary's got to take a ball.
Let's go!
But there was a certain man, which had a charge against him, that he should do this thing.
He was looking for a check or no construction.

And the explanation that Tom was interested.
And the explanation that Tom was interesting today.
The internet is big.
It was Tom who did it.
He who does the will of God remains forever.
And the police think they're holding their hands and leaving them.
The rest of your mind is about your hands and your neck.
And he put forth his hand, and took hold of the hand, and smote them.
You don't even have a hat.
Don't make him afraid.
Let's see why he brought you.
