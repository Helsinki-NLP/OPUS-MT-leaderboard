According to British media, U.S. Navy Deputy Minister for War, William Morlan, would say that even when the US Navy is revitalising its forces to respond increasingly to the growing concern of Russia in both Atlantic borders, the United States continues to expand its territory – the fifth floor extending its scope to include the Indian-Asian-Pacific region – as the focus of the Navy.
According to the British "Principal Protection Week" website, on 24 September, the United States placed central Russia as a strategic competitor in the new defence strategy that was published in the first year.
The United States Navy has then resumed its second round in order to directly oppose Russian activities.
It was reported that these movements raised some doubts and concerns among allies and analysts, who were concerned that the U.S. Navy might be away from marking the "Asian again" strategy of the Government of Obama.
But Morland would say that the United States Navy remains the focus of the West Pacific.
At a round table on 24 January 2018 organized by the National Asian Research Agency in Washington, U.S.A., he said: " There has been no significant change for us. "
Moran says: " The focus is still more balanced, moving more attention or whatever you want to describe it. "
But he admits that the United States is close to Europe.
He said, " We will continue to be concerned about the growth of the West Sea and balance what we can do. "
Although he noted that the overall policy on Russia was within the scope of the mandate of the Minister of Defence of the United States, he warned: " Russians may face the challenges of population and economics, but history proves that if we have a conflict with them, they will be very strong. "
Moran would say that as part of the re-operation of the United States against Russia, China and other competitors, the U.S. Navy is actively deploying troops as a " new combat model " , which would help to prevent the attackers from deploying US Navy troops or other assets at any given time and place.
He said: "Our Navy and the Marine Army support it -- a concept of unpredictable warfare, not once again appearing in the same place, almost as we did -- is our practice. "
It is reported that this new approach was the first attempt by the Hari Durumen Navy team, which early deployment of the combat group included visits to work on ports and patrolling areas that were normally adopted.
Moran said that the U.S. Navy was currently working to ensure that allies knew that these troops would remain in traditional regional patrols and that they would also address logistical and family communications issues for new deployment procedures.
The Australian Royal Navy Command will also make a statement in this event that Australia's army can work together with U.S. Navy combat groups.
He said that the situation would continue as Australia's Royal Navy plans to repurchasing 9 ships equipped with "Cuss" as a protection against the war system.
On 5 October, many airlines were reimbursed or reimbursed for fuel.
Yesterday, OCCA declared that since 5 October 2018, domestic aviation fuel would be additional 800 km (containing) for each of the passengers on the following routes and more than 800 km for each passenger.
As of 5 October 2018, OCCA announced that it would receive additional charges for domestic aviation fuel from 10 dollars/up to 20 kg/s and more than 800 km/s from 10 dollars/up to 30 dollars per passenger from 10 to 30 km/s per passenger from 10 km/s.
Children, the military police remain $10/person; children continue to be exempt.
According to the managing officer concerned, the air carrier has indicated in its notice that the receipt of fuel supplements as at the date of the original issue and that the fuel supplements are not reimbursed when they are replaced by customer votes.
This means that domestic airline customers who had voted before 5 October would not have to pay additional fuel if they were to change to 5 October (containing) if they were to be reimburseded by new standards.
Since 5 June 2018, several airlines, such as the OCCA, have recovered additional domestic fuel from 3 years of withdrawal, with a rate of $10 per person.
This time, the Oca Air Force had announced an increase in fuel consumption for the first time, as a journalist, and had not yet been informed of the progress made in 4 domestic aircraft.
It was also understood that Hong Kong Civil Aviation Service provided that air carriers could decide whether to collect additional fuel from them in November.
It was announced earlier on 27 September that additional fuel would be recovered on 2 November.
The Thai National Aviation Web site shows that all Thai-Thai-Taigon aircraft issued or reissued on or after 2 November would include additional fuel charges, long-term flights to Hong Kong and South-South Pacific regions, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India, African aircraft, additional fuel requirements at $652 and received 146.

Japan ' s five-year business week was worth $13 billion for investment in trust shares in China, reducing its largest business investment transaction due to pressure from China and the United States to trade.
In May 2016, in Tokyo, Japan, a man went to the Red Crescent Society headquarters.
The Red Cross said that the U.S. coal sector was high under trade shock flags and that it had suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
A number of heavy equipment manufacturers in Japan have been warned about the impact of trade fraud in Central America, such as the publication of the latest performance by telecommunications companies, and are now included in this series.
The United States and China have been threatened by the United States and the United States of America's President Tranquo, who, if unable to resolve the dispute, has to expand the scope of the taxation to a total of $50 billion in Chinese exports of United States goods.
Isuyoshi Hachimura, financial director of Isuyoshi, said that the future trade dispute could have a greater impact on China ' s economy.
The Ivorian trader and the Thai Abbey Group have invested US$100 billion in 2015 and has access to 20 per cent of its units.
Hachimura stated that the Ivorian business held a loss of $143.3 billion ($13 billion) for this part of the unit, as it was believed that the price of the Central Unit would not be reimbursed in the near future.
Ivorian business maintains a profit forecast for the financial year ended 31 March 2019 at around 5 billion days.
In July China added 25 per cent of import duties to the United States of America to counter the initiative in the Mosquito trade.
"Our livestock business has been attacked by the American trade molluscs," said the Ministry of the Red Cross.
He said that he had stopped his own financial transactions since September.
High-level speaker Pat Burke stated in his statement on Friday that the company was " restricted by internal policies and because of the lack of market opportunities " .

The annual benefits of maintaining red paper and paper production and the production of electronics have not changed over the years.
The four-week business week, published an increase of 16 per cent between April and September, stressing that "the United States and China's trade issues have led to a uncertainty of prospects " .
Three commercials are expected to receive annual benefits to record standards due to increases in mercury production and high commodity prices, such as oil and coal.
Three businessmen also announced a new business plan to work towards an increase of around 640 million days this year (US$ 79.8 billion) in the financial year as at 31 March 2022.
On 5 November, the new Internet electronics consolidated reports that the US mid-term vote has been taken into account.
On 4 November, President Tranup and the Democratic Party voted against their core voters.
Both parties pointed out that the voter voting rate would be key to the left-hand choice.
It was reported that, at 48 hours before the vote of the people of the United States, Tranun was widely attended by candidates from the community party, and former President Obama arrived in Indiana, where he was invited to the election by the Federal Assembly of Democrats (Joe Donnelly) to the polling station and finally appealed to the public before the election.
On 4 November, Tranun went to Mei, Georgia, as the candidate for the President of the Party, Brian Kemp, who said: " You have to go to the polling station on Tuesday, you have to vote. "
"It is unlikely that this election will be more clear. "
The political enthusiasm of the voters has increased to a high level, and some states have voted too often.
The President of the United States of America has been elected during the first term, and the seats of the national parliamentarians of his political party have often been reduced.
According to the New People's Movement published on "Washington Post" and the United States Broadcasting Network (ABC News) 4, while the elections of the Federal Assembly of Democrats remain favourable, the common party can benefit from the serious concern of economic assessment and security at the Tranun-U.S. border.
The census showed that voters like to vote in the House of Representatives of the Democratic People ' s Party more than those in the House of Commons, by 50 per cent to 43 per cent, but 14 per cent remain below.
Another public movement carried out by U.S. National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and the Wall Street Journal also shows that 7 per cent of the Democratic Party is still the leader of the party.
It was reported that Obama, in his position as Senator Donoli, said to the public: " If people don't speak the truth, if they don't represent anything else, it would certainly be bad.
When people tell only self-esteem lies, democracy can't work."
"Now the only way to stop the actions of these partners is by you and your vote. "
The most difficult elections have been faced by the Democratic Party in the Senate for decades, and the current joint party has more than 51 seats.
However, the choice of the House of Commons is more favourable, and the Democratic Party needs to gain 23 more seats in order to control the House of Commons with 435 seats.
According to analysts at the FuveThirtyExight.com website, the potential for democracy's public councils is 85% high.
The National Political Coalition was held in the Near Plenary, a seminar on key ideas on strengthening and improving people's political cooperation.
The National Political Association held a seminar on the importance of strengthening and improving the political cooperation of peoples in the Near Plenary, in Tokyo, from 29 to 30 days.
The Standing Committee of the Central Political Office, the President of the National Political Co-Chair, attended and spoke.
He stressed the importance of the recent General Assembly's review of the idea of strengthening and improving the political collaboration of peoples, as well as the role of people's political associations, objectives, responsibilities, and practical requirements in response to a series of directional, comprehensive and strategic issues, which pointed to strong thinking weapons for the work of modern-day people's political cooperation.
In order to take this important idea seriously, take into account its important meaning, its richness and spiritual nature, effectively making practical progress in learning, in order to learn concepts, to improve the quality of the work of armed promoters of politics, and to effectively carry out new missions of the new generation of peoples' political associations.
On 29-30 September, the National Political Coalition held a seminar on key ideas on strengthening and improving public political collaboration in Beijing.
He noted that since the 18th anniversary of the party's recent General Assembly, he has presented a series of new ideas on strengthening and improving public political cooperation, the first of which was a major channel of socialist consultation and a special consultative body, an important part of the national governance system, an important component of China's system of special arrangements, an expression of the characteristics and advantages of the new political party system, emphasising the correct handling of the relationship of the people's democracy, and emphasising the fact that it is well-conceived and that the people's affairs are the subject of public negotiations, demonstrating a logical link between the "government of China" and the political system of China, and that it is the most important result of the political consensus of the party.
He stressed that political associations at all levels, in terms of theoretical learning, were a tool to explore further weaknesses and weaknesses in the work of political collaboration, and called for a break-down in strengthening and improving their effectiveness.
In order to fully strengthen the construction of political partners parties, it is essential to ensure that central decision-making processes are deployed without compromising compliance with the policy-making work.
In order to strengthen the political orientation of thought and to improve the system, procedures and mechanisms for the implementation of the political orientation of the concept of capital and cohesive consensus " , in all aspects and processes of performance.
In order to ensure the full implementation of the Centre ' s mandate, it would be better to be obedient from the service parties and the national authorities, to improve the financial quality of construction and to enhance the effectiveness of performance.

In order to pursue in-depth learning in the 19th spirit of special socio-socialism in the new generation of China, the National Political Association has begun to undertake a comprehensive study of key ideas on strengthening and improving the work of people's political associations since May, gathering eight regional conferences and seven expert conferences, setting out 18 focused topics and six basic thematic topics, including 79.38,000 members of various levels, and 279,000 participants from the Department of the Agency for Education and Research, forming the remaining 36,000 study papers.
On 5 November, the People ' s Network of Beijing (the Royal Bank) began to focus more and more on patent development and related protection work, deepening the potential value of patents and becoming a market-led sovereign.
Similarly, a number of technological enterprises have experienced minor violations in terms of patent technology authorizations, such as patent technology use.
By the end of 2017, the defence from the province of Pratio, where three persons had been charged with patent violations, would be executed by the "Development of APP" Developers of Beijing Small Sciences Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Scientific Technology"), the Company of Businesses (hereinafter "Technology"), and the Trader of Internet Information Services in the Far East Pacific (hereinafter referred to as the West Pacific) against the Court of intellectual property rights of the State.
Three prosecutors requested a court order, and three accused immediately ceased manufacturing, selling, selling and using the special practices of the accused.
On 30 October 2018, the Chinese Judiciary Network published a " defence, a violation of the rights of a national court of patents, such as a small-scale limited company in Beijing " , and disclosed some of the cases in which the appellant was charged with a patent infringement.
The third complainant considered that "a vehicle service system based on a move-out terminal and the " patented patent rights and inventor" method, while the "dangerous" operation in the "APP" aircraft " throughout the process of operation, and the technical programme for the protection of patents in the case, constituted a violation of the patent.
However, during the Court ' s decision, the small-scale technology of the West Pacific was not considered suitable and provided free download of the APP ' s case on the web only and did not implement the case ' s expertise without direct or indirect violations and should not be included in the case.
Secondly, the case is not in the East in violation of the law.
In accordance with the rule of law, the violation of the jurisdiction of the court should be carried out in the place of full implementation of the technique of the award of the case and therefore requested the transfer of the case to the local court of the accused, namely the Beijing Court of intellectual property.
The Court of Informed Rights of the State considers that the accused has provided APP products for alleged rape on its network platform and that the accused is not inappropriate in the Pacific of the accused.
The accused is also located in the city of the state of the province, within the jurisdictional area of the Court of intellectual property of the state.
The defendant claimed that the case was transferred to the Beijing Court of intellectual property and, on the basis of insufficient grounds, rejected the objections made by the small-scale technical firm of the accused against the jurisdiction of the case and taken into account the costs incurred in the cases of jurisdiction.
Other proceedings in the present case have not yet been published, and the press will also pay close attention to the follow-up to the case of patent violations.
Visiting Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Science and Industrial Research Organization: outstanding results of scientific cooperation in Australia
" China ' s scientific technology has developed rapidly over the past few decades, and both Australia ' s countries have joined in the field of science and are able to achieve the desired results. "
The Australian Federal Science and Industrial Research Organization, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federation of Science and Industry Studies, Larari Mašel, in Beijing before receiving a new social journalist's visit, said that cooperation from climate change to "day" project, with cooperation in the field of science and technology in Australia, was an excellent tool.
As the largest national scientific research institution in the Australian Federation, CSIRO has obtained many innovative research results in areas such as oceans, energy, biology, materials and space.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with science institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"This is a long-term friendship, which includes the tradition of trust and long-term cooperation of partners."
In May this year, China ' s 500-metre-point satellite radio remote — " China ' s Day Eye " — was installed at the first 19-block L-point receiver on the international front.
This is currently the most advanced 19-block source receiver in the international world, developed jointly by middle Australian scientists.
Marshall stated that the successful development of the receivers was based on CSIRO ' s multi-year technical accumulation and that, following the launch of the FAST cycle, it would increase 5 to 6 times, while further scientific observation objectives would be developed.
"This is a force that CSIRO contributed to FAST."
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO has close cooperation with the Chinese Institute for Science and Technology in building a flat-rate range of satellites and developing new fuel technologies, which can reduce emissions.
" Previous scientific research is often a matter of over a hundred years, and there is a need for more scientific research efforts to solve the problem that lies ahead. "
In his view, two Australian countries were complementary in the field of scientific development, while both faced a range of challenges in development.
For example, extreme weather on a global scale has led to droughts and floods that have led to food shortages, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, population explosions, ageing and chronic illness are also a major challenge.
" Cooperation between the two countries in Australia in recent years is mainly aimed at solving these problems. "
He explained that CSIRO and the International South-South Pacific Research Centre for Ocean Science and Technology, which was built together with the National Institute for Ocean Science and Technology, focused on monitoring the phenomenon of El Niño and Laina, studying the relationship between them and extreme weather, and establishing emergency warning facilities; and CSIRO could also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
" In the current environment, technological innovation is difficult to complete on its own and requires a very high cost and a high number of challenges to be addressed, so cooperation is particularly important today. "
Marshall indicated that cooperation was closer to the potential for more fragmented progress, which was also the meaning of strengthening cooperation between the two parties in Australia within the "one-way " framework.
" Strengthening bilateral cooperation is primarily scientific cooperation for us. "
For example, in the case of Mahalalel, CSIRO has recently developed a gold mining law that is not used for pesticides, which is very serious because of traditional mining gold mining legislation against the environment, and many countries hope to find a gold mining method for environmental pollution.
"We are willing to introduce this technology into China, which is one of the results we have participated in "one way" cooperation. "
On 29 March 2018, the Co-operation Conference on Travelling Projects for Baby Sages in New York City was held, and the participants were also impressed by local food and a culture of local historical importance while enjoying the results of the development of the baby.

Some 500 media participants attended the conference.
The North East is alive and concerned about the National Development Board.
Industrial enterprises in the North-East region are more important, based on the acquisition of innovation for the North-East, and innovation is the pursuit of the future.
Whether it is possible to reinvigorate the dynamics of the old industrial base, release it, and stimulate the overall record.
The Korean Foreign Minister Liquor stated to the United Nations that the continued implementation of the sanctions would not be possible for Korea to abandon nuclear weapons on its own in such a case.
At the United Nations General Assembly, Lilongwe stated that last year Korea had adopted " very friendly practices " , including the cessation of missiles and nuclear testing, the elimination of nuclear testing sites and its commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we didn't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
" If we don't trust the United States, our national security will not be trusted, and in this case we will not be able to give up arms once and for all. "
Although Lilongwe was the time to repeat its complaint against the United States of America against "the phase" of nuclearization, his words were significant because it was not as in the past as in Korea, completely refused to nuclearize.
Lilongwe referred to the joint statement of 12 June Kinsain and Tranpu, which was at the time when Kinsain agreed to work towards nuclearization on the Korean peninsula, and Tranquil promised to protect the security of Korea.
Korea has been seeking to officially end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has stated that it must first abandon nuclear weapons.
The United States also refuses to relax its demands for international sanctions against Korea.
"The United States ' continued to ' nuclearization ' , and increased sanctions to achieve its objective in a high-pressure manner, even refusing to declare 'the end of the war ' , " Lilongwe stated.
"The idea that sanctions can cause us to complain is that we don't know what our people are dreaming about.
But the problem is that such persistent sanctions are deepening our mistrust. "
Lilongwe did not mention the second financial plan mentioned earlier this week in the United Nations by the President of the United States.
On the contrary, he stressed that China and the President of Korea had met three times in the past five months and said: " If the other party that went nuclear was Korea rather than Korea, nuclearization would not be so persistent. "
China declared that since 1 November 2018 it has reduced import duties for 1585 tax purposes.
Since this year, China has taken the initiative to reduce import duties.
This year, on 1 May, total import duties will be adjusted to zero for all conventional anticancer medicinal products and biodegradable biodegradable medicinal products, including anticancer medicinal products.
At the same time, the production of anticancer drugs has been significantly reduced and the import value of taxable income increases.
On 1 July, a reduction in the duty rate for 218 vehicles and spare parts.
After tax reductions, the Chinese vehicle-wide rate of taxation has been lower than the average level of developing countries and is in actual conformity with the Chinese car industry.
This reduction will promote industrial structural adjustment and resource optimisation, speed up excellence and help improve the quality of products and services, and is expected to contribute to a certain degree to vehicle price adjustment and make consumers more effective.
Consumer tax fell on 1 July for 1449 tax purposes.
Day-to-day consumption taxes are related to the need for a comfortable life for the people.
This tax reduction is not only large and strong but also 56 per cent on average.
Day-to-day consumption taxes directly benefit consumers and promote competitiveness in the domestic industry.
On 1 November, taxes will be imposed on mechanical electrical equipment for 1585 tax purposes, industrial goods such as spare parts and raw materials.
Appropriate reductions in import tariffs for domestically-industrial goods can attract more external resources, contribute to increasing effective domestic supply, contribute to industrial growth while helping businesses to adjust resources globally, reduce production costs, and reduce pressures on the domestic environment.
The Office of the Committee on Taxation of the State Office of China introduced a description of the managers of the previous four independent tax reductions and the third phase of the extension of the negotiations under the information technology agreement on 1 July this year will result in a reduction of China ' s overall rate of duty by 9.8% to 7.5 per cent last year.
The post-adjusted overall level of tariffs is slightly higher than the EU, which is lower than most developing countries, at the medium-lowest level, and is fundamentally aligned with the status and development phase of developing countries in China.
The Heads indicated that the overall level of duty as an important indicator of openness in the area of trade in goods in China should be adapted to the economic development phase in China and reflect contemporary characteristics.
China ' s global trade in goods has already had an increasingly open economic base, but there is still a gap between the quality and benefits of trade development and the developed economies and should therefore be adequately reduced in the overall level of duty.
Customs are a common means of protection, and tariff levels should be adapted to industrial competitiveness, encouraging good competition and excessive protection against industrial development and improving quality.
Tax rates are adjusted to take into account production needs and consumer needs.
Focusing on reducing domestic demand and contributing to the increase in commodity tax rates in industrial transformation, efforts to increase the import of special preferential products that are more focused on the population ' s needs, to increase the growing awareness of businesses and the public and to meet the increasing needs of industrial structures and consumer structures.
The reduction of tax forces takes into account the acceptable capacity of financial income and industrial development.
In specific options for the reduction of tax and tax levels, better coordination of two domestic markets is required, on both sides of the journey, to produce and consume two relations and to maintain a positive development trend in China ' s economic stability.
The Heads stressed that this year was the 40th anniversary of reform, and China's initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs was an important initiative to achieve high-quality development needs in China itself, contributing to the integrated use of two resources outside the international country, to promote the quality of the domestic supply system and to meet the needs of the population ' s consumption levels.
This action and initiative indicated that China would firmly support economic globalization and maintain the principle of free trade and the central multilateral trading system of WTO, continue to build on development motivation from the openness of the world and make China's development more beneficial to the world.
Serbia announced its entry into the highest level of equipment. The President of Séo will discuss the situation in Kosovo tomorrow.
The South-West Association appealed to the Office of the President of Serbia ' s Office that, given the way in which Kosovo ' s armed forces occupied the Gaza Strip under the control of Belgrade in the north of Kosovo, it ordered the Serbian President to enter the country ' s armed forces into the highest military situation.
On 29 September, the Minister of Defence of Serbia said that the Serbian army had entered the full-time equipment situation.
He stressed that Serbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as the orders issued by the U.S. Army remained valid, regardless of the direction in which the situation developed.
According to the Russian Federation report, on 29 September, Vuchić indicated that he had been informed of the current situation with other European parties, such as the United States, and would go to Moscow on 2 October to meet with the Russian President Putin and seek support on the issue of Kosovo.
When asked whether Serbia is in need of military support from Russia like Syria, Vuchić replied with a negative response: " I do not wish to experience a major military conflict on our territory. "
VUC also indicated that the military would enter into a comprehensive armed situation only to create a threat to prevent conflict, but it was also a clear warning: no violence would ever be tolerated in Kosovo.
As a result of the military's enhancement of the equipment situation, two major initiatives in Kosovo are related.
According to Serbia, the Albanians have recently been under massive arrest for generations of Serbs living in the region of the northern region of Kosovo, and these Serbs who have been arrested have not been subject to any law.
It is surprising that since 26 March this year, Al-Qaida has been arrested and arrested by the Kosovo Army, the head of the Kosovo and Metohija Office of the Government of Serbia, has continued to improve the situation in the region and has been subjected to unhindered arrest and expulsion from Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 armed police and attackers from the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Kosovo, which had previously been declared on their own day, occupied a position near the Gaza Strip, entering the ecological and sports centres near the northern edge of the Kosovo region, and blocked all roads near them, which had been controlled by Serbia.
Vuchić noted that this military risk action in Kosovo was carried out under the auspices of the Western States and that the operations of the Kosovo army had not previously notified Serbia of violations of Chapter IX of the Brussels Agreement and of military technical agreements between United Nations Council resolution 1244 and Seko.
Vuchić has spoken to the Secretary-General of the North York, St. George Beg, to criticize the false statements by Western countries on the issue of Kosovo.
The root cause of the conflict is the fact that hundreds of years of history between the two tribes of Seaa in the Kosovo region.
With regard to Kosovo ' s inheritance, the Serbs and the Arab have different words.
Serbia saw Kosovo as a national refuge and cultural haven, since Serbia had established its most powerful country here in the 12th century, and the Arab had only entered large numbers after the invasion of the Osman country and the fall of the army.
The Arab also maintained that the original tribe of Ilyrians who lived in Kosovo from 4 to 5 centuries ago were the ancestors of the Arab people, so Kosovo had been the territory of the Arab people since then.
The topical political division has resulted in a wide variety of nationalities, a strong conflict between religion and culture, and a strong struggle between Serbs and Arabs in the Kosovo region.
In 1912 the Kosovo Arabs first declared their independence from Albania.
After the first world war, a large number of Arab people living in the Balkan Peninsula moved to Turkey, and Serbs were significantly higher than they were, and the Serbs seemed to be “just taking their own land” and were regarded by the Arabs as a "Asserbiaism" and the two groups were amalgamized.
Kosovo became the " Firearm " of the Balkans.
In 1999, the armed conflict between the Albanian separatists of the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian Army and the police led to the bombing of the NATO army against the South Union comprising Serbia and Montenegro and the outbreak of the Kosovo war.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia.
Although Serbia will then communicate information on normalization of relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, it is not possible to sign a multilateral agreement with the benefit of the historical nation and the geopolitical dividend.
However, a month ago, Vuchić first made it clear that he had advocated the separation of Serbs and Arabs in Kosovo and that he had reopened the dispute.
The electrical communications are still being interrupted.
According to the figures published by UNCCD on the 30th of June, a severe earthquake and tsunami in the Sulawesi province of the country had resulted in 420 deaths.
According to William Rampangilei, head of the Indian Disaster Relief Agency, this figure is only the initial statistics of the city of Kupalu, the city of Central Sulawesi, about 80 km away, because of the lack of substantial rescue equipment, which has not yet been recovered by many of the city ' s hotels, shops and warehouses.
Local time, on 29 September 2018, Indonesia's Bar, a series of blast blasts destroyed by earthquakes and tsunamis.
The destruction of electricity and communications facilities continues to be an unconnected " island " , which cannot be estimated by the number of victims.
Meanwhile, the media reported that the number of people or thousands of people were claimed by the Vice-President of Indonesia to be dead.
Power interruptions, communication interruptions, road interruptions, airport damage... and disaster relief work after the sea.
Because of the power interruption, some hospitals and relief facilities in the city of Palu needed fuel generation.
The road to the city, however, was blocked by the mountain peaks, including the oil tankers, which were unable to access large vehicles and made fuel supply very tense.
The Ministry of Social Affairs of Indonesia stated that, because of road damage, the Ministry had not yet transported emergency relief areas such as beds, beds, shoes, clothing, food and household supplies from nearby areas.
Disaster relief materials transported from the capital of Jakarta are being transported through air carriers to disaster areas.
In view of the damage suffered by the Palu airport command boards and routes in the earthquake, all commercial flights have been stopped and military aircraft for the purpose of transporting relief materials and personnel have been dropped.
In Indonesia's relief policy, the integrated minister of law and security requested that electricity supply and airport business services be restored as soon as possible in order to ensure the operation of relief agencies such as the hospital and to enable more rescue personnel and volunteers to transport aid to disaster areas.
On 28 January, the Sulawesi Province of Indonesia continued to experience a number of severe earthquakes, resulting in an earthquake at 7:7 a.m. on the local level at 17.02 p.m., resulting in a major disaster in the city of Palu, Cúgara, and in the western part of the region.
In New Beijing on October 1st, the newsmagazine, as well as air-conditioned, air-conditioned, air-conditioned... ... ...In the near future, Beijing will continue to launch the most beautiful blue-day model, and will attract thousands of people from all over the social platform, and will be happy in continuing painting, saying, 'The Blue White Line,' between the United States and Beijing, is the best list ' .
Since August, Beijing has come to " the bluest sky " .
In Tokyo, people can always see or use a cell phone or take photos of a single anti-circuit camera.
On social platforms, such as M.O.S.S.A., you can always see the origins of your friends' head, the sky, the birds, and the birds... all buildings look different under the shadow of the blue sky.
There are net friends who say that such a "high-lighted boy" is the best city advertising in Beijing; and there are netizens who say that if such a weather is long gone, people will get better; there are more online friends who hope that "the blues will be more warmer and more warmer for the day in Beijing."
What's the day for the people of Beijing?
It is only because of the suffering of people living in this city who have suffered in the past, who are suffering from extreme weather, and in Beijing fighting " the Blue War " , which continues to improve the quality of the air, and the increase in the blue sky, which is seen in the eyes of the public as a source of joy and joy.
On the day of the national party, Beijing was a good day.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the vast majority of 35 air quality monitoring stations throughout the city showed the green "level superiors".
The "Most Bluest Sky" film show on social media platforms is still continuing.
Why is it so blue in Beijing recently?
According to the relevant authorities of the Beijing City Environmental Protection Agency, in August this year, Beijing's micro-organism (PM2.5) averages 35 micrometres/litres and has created the best record for a period of almost five years.
The actual volume of PM2.5 between September is more than the current number.
A major factor in the phenomenon of the "most blue skies" is the overall benefits of the recent climate conditions, and more importantly, Beijing's climate pollution management has been in progress over the past five years, with the continued release of environmental benefits and the reduction of total emissions of pollutants in the region, which have provided a basis for continuous improvement in air quality.
Beijing officially published and implemented " Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017 " in Beijing in 2013.
According to the plan, the official continued to guide non-heading operations to promote energy cleanup and pollution reduction efforts, with total fuel consumption of 4923 people.
Beijing has also become the first major cities to achieve global natural gas generation in China.
Data show that Beijing's PM2.5 average annual levels have decreased by 35.6 per cent between 2013 and 2017; air quality indicators have increased by 50 days; high-level levels have increased by 25 days; total number of re-infection days have decreased by 35 days and the rate of re-infection has declined significantly.
At the same time as continued air quality improvement, Beijing official analysis based on a new source of PM2.5 released in September this year ' s plan of action for " Combating the Three-year War against the Blue Age War " , combined with the current governance and pollution characteristics of oil-consuming vehicles, fuel-powered and operational organic governance areas, improved transport structures, industrial structures, energy structures and land-use structures, strengthened regional defence units, efforts to strengthen urban detail management, to fully promote green development, to make "the most blue sky" in Tokyo, not " as a source of wealth " , and to make it the backbone of people " .
During this year's golden week, the relevant sectors of the City Commission, business, urban administration, public security, etc. will strengthen enforcement checks on the "one day" market, combine tourism with "six" distortions, and, once the offender is verified, will be severely punished by law.
Yesterday morning, the city government convened a serious "day of holiday" and deployed specific actions aimed at increasing the "day of holiday".
It was revealed that black ballots, blackmails, blackmails, black cars, black cars, black shops, "six" interlinked "black" riots were launched in the city since 28 July.
To date, 39 complaints were received by "one day" throughout the city, 63 per cent by 63 per cent; since this year, 270 complaints by "one day" by the whole city have been received by 62 per cent.
In almost two months, the entire city has seen "black car" 248, 158 violations of travel operations, 29 closures of purchases "black shop" and the theater, 27 "13" persons " black society " , 27 " black" persons " , 260,000 "forcible advertising "for a day" , 3rd public holiday tickets, 1789 for violations of traffic law, 181 cases for officials, 448 million for reparation and 111 for traffic offences.
Under the rule of order, the illegal "day of the "day" is basically controlled, and the "day of the" market is in a stable position.
It has been reported that in recent years the city has continued to increase its governance over the illegal "one-day journey".
In 2016 and 2017, the City Tourism Commission received a "one-day" complaint of 1612 and 897, with a reduction of 79 per cent and 44 per cent respectively, but the "one-day" was still ongoing, often counter-blowing, and created a "six-black" distortion of mutual interest links such as black, black, black, black, black and black.
In particular, street illegal customers are " blacklisted " , " blacknet " , " blacknet " , " travel agency or non-trafficking company property " , " black company " , " black company " , " black company " , " black company " and " blackmail " without leading evidence or contravention of the law enforcement industry , " black" , and " black shop " , which is used to provide non-trafficking vehicles or a " illegal " tour" for a day " .
In this specific operation, the city continued to increase its regular inspection and mobile monitoring of illegal "one-day" journeys and to detect violations of evidence from a strict legal basis following a day-to-day " illicitly deployed and affected tourist routes.
Among them, "black car" and "black shop" have become two serious focusses in special operations.
It was reported that without a black car, an illegal "day of journey" could not be carried out, that the black car was easily discovered, stored and searched, and that it was a high-value fixed asset.
The relevant sector uses road traffic surveillance to explore the greater regulation of the road road traffic on the " one-day journey" line, using technology and technology tools such as defence, as well as the discovery of " black vehicle " .
The "black shop" purchase of travel goods has become a serious focus because of the limited number of sit-ins.
In order to strengthen the terror and fight against the illegal " single day " , the functional sectors are punished by severe penalties if they are found to be in violation of the law.
This year, in August of this year, the city has also held a seminar on the legal issues of serious illegal "day of spring " and on measures related to administrative penalties and criminal offences.
The City Tourism Commission indicated that more formal travel companies would be encouraged in the future to provide Beijing "one day " and to extend one day " a day" to further cover the living space "one day" of illegal tourism, and the current specific programme is also in the study.
In addition, the City Tourism Commission has continued to improve the mission ' s electronic programme information system to ensure that each team is integrated into the control of the electronic agenda platform.

Active treatment, up to 98 per cent of birth survival in China, 29 weeks and earlier, has reached the level of developed countries.
The National Children's Medical Centre at the Central Network on 30 September (Sustainment of Roxana) and the National Children's Medical Centre of the University of Rehabilitation revealed 30 days of the Children's Hospital, which introduced a way of improving the quality of early birth project in the head of the China NICU.
The results of the project showed that, with positive treatment, China ' s 29 weeks and earlier early birth survival rate reached 98 per cent at the developed country level, but there was still a greater improvement in the number of early childhood and early childhood survival rates.
For nearly 20 years, the Chinese Government has been concerned about the survival of new births.
At present, infant mortality rates in the above sea area have fallen to 3.71 grams, which is clearly lower than the national average, reaching the advanced level of developed countries.
"Increase the quality of early birth in China ' NCIU's project to improve the quality of life of early birth " has significantly increased the quality of early births through four years.
In his statement to the journalist, Professor Dr. Hung-Hung-Hungary, Department of Child Rehabilitation at the University of Rehabilitation (NICU), said that while improving early childhood survival, attention was focused on reducing the quality of early childhood survival, reducing the incidence of early birth, improving post-natal development and improving the overall endpoint of the child and the importance of improving the overall quality of life and quality of early birth, which was an important issue of the outer world and the concern of the New Child Sciences community, as well as the key issue of this project ' s concern.
"Probability of early births in China NICU" through four years of continuous efforts to acquire 33 weeks of national births and the following early births, resulting in a fall of 1/3 in early births and early births, while a significant decline in early birth and early birth rates has significantly increased the quality of early birth.
The project, through the establishment of a network of nationally-birth improved collaboration networks, introduces the idea of a quality improvement of collaboration, the deployment of 25 Chinese-China-wide cooperative hospitals, the establishment of a set of co-operative improvements in national conditions for early births, and improves the integrity of the level of child recovery, the system and effective co-operational quality improvement methods.
According to the project's experience, a guide for the treatment of new births is being developed at the United Nations Children's Fund at the Children's Hospital of the University of Redan, providing guidance and guidance for normal treatment of new births in China.
It was understood that in the "Probation of Prenatal Quality Project in China", the Child Hospital introduced EPIQ methods into the 19 provinces of the country 25 major NICUs to address early childhood infections in the nursing home of China.
Over the past 10 years, Canada has been making progress, with an increase in the number of early births in Canada, and an increase of approximately 1/3, one of Canada ' s best post-global births.
The EPIQ approach has been applied to all NICUs across Canada and has been adopted by six countries.
In the context of paediatric hospitals, the results of studies show that EPIQ is under 35 per cent of early childhood infections, while at the same time 20 per cent of the use of antibiotics.
In the future, the Child Hospital of the University of Redan will continue to extend and implement this approach to the national scope, with a view to reducing the overall incidence of early births and to improving the quality of survival of new births in the country.
Under the circumstances, there were differences and inequities in the levels of relief in the parts of China.
According to Professor Huang, as an important construction unit of the National Children ' s Medical Centre, the Child Hospital will play a leading role, covering several Western provinces, such as New York, U.S.A., Günther, and Sushi, with a view to gradually promoting the equalization and normalization of the new child's survival throughout the country.
It was understood that the United Nations Children's Fund at the Children's Hospital of the University of Redan is in the process of developing guidelines for the treatment of new births based on the experience gained by the project and providing guidance and guidance for normal treatment of new births in China.
It was revealed that, in 2019, the focal point was based on China's new birth co-operation network at the Children's Hospital of the University of Rehabilitation and that 63 United Nations hospitals were conducting a next phase of national quality improvement with a view to promoting the overall development of the level of child welfare in China.
The Director-General of the Commission on Marine Health said that the sea could become central cities of Asia Centre and not only represent research, but also the construction of the entire system of services. The quality of service and service results should be one place in Asia and represent the health level of China.
Cindefiance: "Hero memory " -- -- -- written on the fifth anniversary of the massacre.
On 30 September, at the age of 69, the Republic of Washington, we met on the fifth day of the anniversary of the arrival of the parties of equality and the leaders of the country to the Day of Peace, and attended the celebration of flowers to the people.
At this moment, wherever you are, please honor the wise.
It's a warm day. It's better to wake up.
It's a life of life after every tyrant's name.
They've got hot youth, they've got real love, they've got a close family.
However, because they firmly believe that "our belief is the truth of the universe " , in order to "resolute the suffering of the next generation " , they are willing to sacrifice everything for themselves.
"I'll live one day and cry for China one day."
Over time, the British set up a spirit path leading to the forward direction.
"Where do you come from, where do you go " to make a kind of person " , read English, don't find it hard to answer.
The most important thing is to build up a "Hero memory " in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the period of the revolution, there have been some 200,000 people who have been victims of national independence, peoples who are free and have the strength of the State to surrender.
For various reasons, many do not even have a name.
There are a lot of brilliant ideas about blood, living faith, remembering their geniuses and imparting their spirit are the foundation and soul of the people.
This "Hero-Memorial," without any damage or damage.
For a time, history has been inseparable, and popularized.
Scattering history, damaging practices, challenging justice, misjudged values and caused public awareness and caution throughout society.
It's too cold. He doesn't forget.
The act of touching the bottom line, which cannot be heard, must be braved in order to protect the dignity of the rule of law.
This year, on 1 May, the Heroes Protection Act was officially implemented.
From the practice of justice, the decisions of some cases are of great interest, both to the law to effectively preserve the glorious image of light and to release the hero and to respect the superior right of power.
A nation that has pursued cannot be heroized, and a nation that has a purpose cannot be taken for granted.
He's a hero. He's become a universal social consensus.
At present, there are millions of Memorial facilities in the country, and more than a million people visit the Grandfather's Garden every year.
The heart is the strongest stone.
To make a hero, to protect a hero, to learn a hero, to love the hero as he turns into the wind, to integrate the British spirit into the blood of the nation, a "Hero-Memorial" will suddenly stand in the middle of the universe, with people in the heart.
The road to Brussels on 28 September - in Italy's view of the EU's demand for a large-scale budget deficit plan to make the market more vulnerable to Italy on Friday, but if Italy maintains its ambitious objective, the EU may take a more proactive position.
The Italian Government ' s objective is to provide a three-year deficit equivalent to 2.4 per cent of GDP, which shows that there is no debt reduction in the face of the deficit requirement alone.
" We are not interested in the crisis between the Commission and Italy " , " because the EU's recommendations and sanctions may have little effect on Italy, he reacted cautiously.
EU officials and diplomats still wish to be officially submitted to the European Commission in October, before the Commission was formally presented, and the market forces would be able to convince Italy to adjust its budget plan.
After the Government announced its plan, the euro dropped to a minimum of nearly two weeks and Italy's debt rate reached and reached a maximum of three weeks.
If the objective of the deficit remains unchanged before the end of October, the Commission may reject the draft budget of Italy, which is something that the Committee has never done to any State.
At a meeting in the capital city of Latvia, the Vice-President of the European Commission for Implementation, East Brovsky, said that Italy ' s current financial plan " does not appear to be compatible with the Stability and Growth Convention " , which is the financial provisions of the EU.
But he didn't say what this would cause the EU to react.
The tenderer may submit an application to participate in this open tender before 26 October of this year.

China's Women's Post-Principal Class said that the entire race was not easy.
"We are prepared to be more complete, better web-based, more complete than Turkish military technology, we need to reduce mistakes and strive to win victory through our own initiative."
In the face of a well-known former teammates, the forces of the Turkish Wakif Bank were severely restricted at the first stage of the race, and then she began calling for a change and took a strong step in the past.

The Chinese Engineering Museum has been presented in a very good way.
New Zealand is China's most important breeding area, and according to the National Statistical Office statistics, in 2017 new breeding plants accounted for 35 million tons, representing 61 per cent of the national breeding area.
Since the introduction of land in China in 1982, more than 50 million tons of agricultural surface surfaces have been collected in new areas, using about 300,000 tons of land per year.
Of these, about 60 per cent of the soil cover is 100 per cent, and the soil cover is about 60 per cent of the new land use.
Unsaturated testing is carried out with a total capacity of 320 kilograms to 350 kilograms.
As the number of new landfills increases, the rate of land-based recovery remains low, the level of land-based residues increases gradually and a range of problems such as land-based destruction, which have a serious impact on sustainable agricultural development.
Fatigue not only causes serious contamination of soil but also has a significant impact on the quality of flowers.
Currently, over 1/3 of New Zealand has achieved mechanical extraction.
In 2017, about 14 million U.S. ammonia was absorbed.
A large number of soils have been collected during the process of the extraction of machinery, the breakdown of the soil and the complexity of the debris in the soil are difficult to clean during the process of the processing of the soil and cannot be fully cleaned during the follow-up process and seriously affect the quality of the soil products.
On 28 September, an open-ended exchange of views was held in New Zealand.
In order to try to address soil pollution, simplify cultivation techniques, improve the benefits of soil, and take over his team for eight years, implement "The 619" non-ferrous plants for new agricultural green development " .
The fruit is presented as an early development through innovative new methods of cultivation and development of new seedlings, seedlings, and seedlings " 619 " .
" The ‘Central 619’ has achieved a series of coding measures, such as non-explosive mechanical kits, improved in depth, non-ferrous materials, suitable for the radio spectrum selection, reasonable chemical control. "
Currently, Aksu, Curler, and Aral have established a free model base, up to 4800 square kilometres per square kilometre.
Unsaturated crops have been grown, and crops have been grown, cut, preserved, and improved.
The third agricultural artist from the Agricultural Section of the New York Ministry of Production and Construction said that, through a six-year study of non-ferrous cultivation techniques and models, the total production of non-ferrous metals could reach 320 square kilometres [350 sq km] or even higher.
"The promotion of non-ferrous cultivation technology is a great prospect. "
While it is believed that non-ferrous cultivation technology can now address the problem of soil pollution, there is still a gap between the cultivation of crops and the economic benefits.
"The persistence of the price of the fruit harvest will benefit from future expansion. "
He and his team will continue to carry out in-depth research and large-scale dissemination of applications for non-ferrous metals to strengthen this non-ferrous industry and to address the land pollution caused by landfills in the next step.

He said to the journalist, who had been visiting high school since Long Beach, that the former high school could only sit in the north of Hong Kong while traveling through the city again, change problems and costs, now sitting right in the centre of Ninthon, where children can eat lunch at home and feel very happy.
He said, "The ease of the "two-way" communication process is too much to imagine, " 10 minutes is not possible, both are over. "
The fast-paced train line, which connects the West Bank station on air transport, also became the first place for many transit passengers.
In the West Bank, she walked through the goldfields of Hong Kong, preparing for the arrival of a well-founded little girl and the monkeys from Hong Kong, who said to the journalist: "I was afraid not to fly so fast, but there's too much time left! "
The new United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, which was published on the first week of its publication, will retain the capacity of President Tranton to implement 25 per cent of the import-threading threat to imports, while at the same time allowing the use of vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico, which are essentially exempt from the payment of customs duties.
If Trannut is released for national security reasons for the acquisition of the so-called "232" tariffs for vehicles, Mexico and Canada will have an annual turnover of $26 million for the export of exemptions to the United States.
Pikas produced in both countries will be fully exempt from customs duties, in accordance with the subsidiary arrangements.
If Tranton is charged with motor vehicles, Mexico will receive $10.8 billion per year for the exemption of motor vehicles and Canada will receive $324 million.
The two quotas were far higher than the existing production levels of the two countries and provided growth space for both exports.
On Friday, 28 September - Mexico stated that, following a number of days of debate, the Government of Tranquo and Canada of the United States of America were working to resolve trade policy differences and that it was hoped that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would remain in the form of a tripartite agreement.
Despite the lack of details, the apparent progress mentioned above is sufficient to move Mexico and the Government of the United States to immediately stop publishing the text of the trade agreement to Canada for more time to accede to the agreement.
The Under-President of Mexico (Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador) said to the press in Mexico that the United States Government had introduced new counter-proposals to the Government of Canada and that he would continue to urge all three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Ildefonso Guajardo, Minister of Economics of Mexico, said that the time allowed for the submission of the text of the United States Trade Agreement to Mexico and the United States legislation had been delayed because of "very serious" attempts by the Government of Canada and the United States.
Guahardo said, " In the next 48 hours, we will know that we have reached a third-party agreement text, or we must publish both-party agreement texts. "
Guahardo said that his United States and Canadian fellow officials "required special requirements" to delay the publication of the text.
The speaker at the U.S. Trade Representative ' s Office (USTR) did not comment on the United States trade agreement text and the consultations with Canada.
Officials of the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada and the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs have not responded to requests for assessment of counter-proposals.
According to the media, in one of the conservation centres of the capital of Bellyia, South Africa, there are two small mice playing together and it is difficult to see any unusual place, but they are not really alone.
The University of Berlin declared: "This is a young man who has been born in a way that was used to be professionally - the first generation in the world. "
In the school, scientists are working to study the reproductive system of motherfucking Africans.
Gansworth, Director of the Institute for the Phytosanitary Studies at the University of Berlin, said that these two infants born on 25 August were once healthy and normal.
His team, after 18 months of intensive testing, finally reached this outbreak.
When Hanswent accepted a visit to the media, he said: " We collect sperm from a healthy human body. "
Next, when the number of hormones in the mother's body is reached, the study staff will be trained for it.
Ganswent stated: " Fortunately, the outcome is successful. "
He said that the researchers " tried several times, but it was important that they did not spend too much energy " .
He said that the above research had been reconfirmed by a reconnaissance that scientists wished to use this technology to rescue large-scale mammals from extinction.
The International Natural Protection Union noted that the species of bees had disappeared in 26 African countries and that the total number of surviving wild bees had decreased by 43 per cent over the past 20 years, with only some 20,000 heads.
Africa is listed as an endangered animal by this organization.
"If we don't do anything about this animal, they'll face a lot of trouble."
He stated that this new technology did not require that the eggs should be admitted to nutrition, but that as long as the embryos were inserted into pregnant mothers, they were the same as the practices of North America and Europe in respect of reproductive images.
Korea ' s exports fell by the greatest in September for two years, but the analysts reduced the number of working days and claimed that despite the rise in trade tensions in Central America, global demand for Korean goods remained strong.
Indeed, Korea's exports increased every day last month.
In addition, early disclosures of initial value data show that exports in the first few weeks prior to the holiday period have increased by two weeks.
Korea ' s exports in September and the largest since July 2016 have decreased by 5.7 per cent of the estimated decrease of 11 analysts over the road.
The initial value published on the week indicates that the export rate in September was $55.6 million, which was less than $512 million in August.
Despite the growing concern about the growing trade in the United States of America that may lead to other countries that are dependent on exports, in September Korea grew by 7.8 per cent to exports to China and continued to expand for 23 months.
Korea has dropped 11.8 per cent of its exports to the United States and has fallen by the sale of oil products.
The country's sales of fossil fuels and oil products abroad increased by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively, although the so-called "super-level cycle" of the market's concern may already have been seen.
" However, the impact of trade conflicts will be difficult to avoid, since Korea ' s exports are heavily dependent on the US and China markets. "
Imports decreased by 2.1 per cent to $408 million, or growth by 3.1 per cent from road surveys.
The trade surplus in September was $9.9 billion, which was higher than $69 million in August.
The Ministry of Industry claims that the United States and the EU will continue its global manufacturing industry, which is a useful factor for Korea ' s exports.
The declaration states that " the export prices resulting from the increase in oil prices will also benefit exports in the next half of the year. "
" However, the continued trade conflict between the United States and China, as well as the increase in post-U.S. market fluctuations, is all the negative pressure that exports face. "
On average, each working day in September exports increased to $26 billion and $2 billion in August.
This year, Korea collapsed from 24 to 26 September, resulting in only 19.5 working days in September and less than four working days last year.
Korea ' s exports increased by 4.7 per cent over the previous year.
According to the Project Manager's Index, Korea's manufacturing activities were resumed in September, but domesticized as a result of the decline from China and Japan's lists, which would lead to other export prospects.
Korean media criticized the United States for not giving up its sanctions.
Korea ' s paper " Working News " of 30 September, which criticized the United States ' s comment on the "consistent" approach to sanctions at the same time as seeking dialogue in the morning.
The article said that the United States of America ' s " 4th anniversary " of the non-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula was key to the implementation of the sanctions against the East " , stressing that the United States continued to implement the United Nations sanctions resolution.
In a joint statement by Singapore, the two parties committed themselves to establishing a new United States relationship that is consistent with the desire for peace prosperity for the peoples of the two countries of Korea.
One United States of America's increased sanctions force demands dialogue, which is undoubtedly contradictory.
The article said that, if a new Korean relationship was to be established, a lasting peace-building system in the Korean peninsula and the achievement of the full non-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula, trust in the construction should be put at the top of the building, starting from what could be done and gradually resolved.
The article also said that the United States should understand that sanctions did not interfere with the practice of Korea.
The article says that even "Northern Deveńsk" before "Kakasan" was also praised by the U.S. Army.
The National Interest magazine called the U.S. Navy opinion saying, "We'll meet a powerful potential opponent.
The current U.S. Army Commander General for the European Navy also has the honour of the "Northern Deveńsk" submarine.
He said: " This potential factor is very impressive. See the development of the Russian Navy and how resources are being used, and the main efforts it has made in research and development are to strengthen the team. "
However, the National Interest magazine continues to believe that the United States maintains its advantage over Russia in this area.
Vogo says: " I believe Western countries still have no claim for advantages. "
It was previously reported that the Russian Navy would include the canal of "Kakasan" in 2019.
"Kashan" , "New Siberia " , "Krasnoyarsk " , "Alhangersk " , "The multi-purpose submarines are the type of "whitewood-M" and the volume of water is 13800 tons, 520 metres below the ground floor, 64 people are prepared, 31 sections below the waterway, will carry watermines, fishmines and "foul" and "mash" missiles.

No threat to the United States!
EU or will reach agreement with Iran on the purchase of oil
The Government of the United States had announced that in November a new round of sanctions would be reopened against Iran, and it even urged other countries to reduce imports of oil into Iran.
However, it seems the U.S. allies didn't listen.
According to the U.S. "New York Times " report, on 29 September, Iran's Minister for Foreign Affairs Zarif was informed that despite the threat of sanctions against any State that deals with Iran, Tehran was approaching an agreement on the sale of oil.
The core purpose of the agreement is to try to create a new payment mechanism, which is to replace US$ transactions by a cheap or current price.
The purpose of this approach is to move across the United States and prevent the United States from preventing financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is committed to the promotion of the agreement, some French and British officials are also concerned that if the agreement can be reached, it would be the most open opposition between the EU and the United States of America to withdraw the nuclear agreement.
The American media claim that in an hour of interview, Zarif's words are more optimistic than they have been in recent months.
Since the agreement has the ability to "disappear" American traditional allies, the United States has effectively broken down its efforts to reduce Iran's income.
" This will ensure that we sell and benefit from oil " , Zariv believes that States have the legitimate right to trade with Iran in accordance with the agreement reached in 2015.
Prior to the day of the EU Foreign Policy Officer, Erica Moguerini also stated that " no sovereign State or organization can accept the decision of any other person and can trade with anyone " .
However, she also predicted that a number of financial instruments could be taken by U.S. leaders before the United States Government launched its next sanctions in November with a view to dealing with commercial banks, traders and States in Tehran.
This year, in May this year, the United States Government declared unilaterally withdrawing from the INU agreement and stated that it could not permanently prohibit the production of nuclear fuels by Iran.
The United States subsequently threatened to prohibit companies that bought Iran oil and other goods from operating in the United States.
This threat has led to the withdrawal of some companies from Tehran, Iran's currency.
Businesses such as air passenger companies and French oil pipelines have eliminated millions of dollars ' worth of investment for I.
British and French officials have stated that the United States Government may " take over " .
However, according to a recent Turkish media report, the United States sanctions do not seem to have had a significant impact on Iran ' s oil exports.
The Minister for Oil of Iran endorsed the fact that no other country could stop buying Iranian oil except Korea.
Zarif and President Luhani of Iran believe that a series of American acts are intended to "instrument" Iran in violation of the agreement.
Zarif also felt indifferent to a series of U.S. oral attacks when it was asked whether the United States would exert a growing financial pressure on the current Iranian government, and he even laughed, "It is a more effective strategy of government, which is the real purpose of the United States. "

The journalists learned from the National Health Commission, and my country's malnutrition rate for young children has declined significantly over the decades.
In this regard, experts have noted that the most important concept of maintaining health is " disease-free " , a major development of scientific health and rational diets.
In accordance with the " Central Information and Explanation of Health Education for Young People in China (2018 ) " , the maintenance of health is key to reasonable nutrition and science campaigns.
Overweight, weight loss and weight loss are not good for health.
The health behind the "little bear" doesn't ignore it.
The China Centre for Disease Prevention and Health Control has stressed that overweight adolescents are prone to normal development, negative effects on their mental, behaviour, awareness and intelligence, even leading to high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood pressure.
At the same time, adolescent obesity will be more likely to continue to persist to adulthood and increase the risk of high blood pressure and chronic diseases such as diabetes.
He stressed that the food and health testing of the Chinese population in 2010-2012 showed that my country's 6-17-year-old adolescent was 9.6 per cent, the pregnancy rate was 6.4 per cent, and both were 16 per cent.
At the same time, adolescent pregnancies are higher than women and cities are higher than rural characteristics, and obesity rates are significantly higher in recent decades.
How can adolescents cope with obesity?
The Deputy Director of the Research Centre for Health and Health Promotion of the National Sports Directorate-General noted that the main causes of adolescent pregnancy are excessive and insufficient physical activity.
For such a simple pregnancy, the scientific movement should focus on reasonable food control.
The emphasis is on maintaining health, which is the most important concept of " disease control " , one of which is the importance of the full-fledged Copenhagen education for schools, parents and students, which is a widespread threat to pregnancy and raising awareness of the prevention of adolescents.
Young people should be regularly examined and monitored for high levels of growth development indicators, and early findings of scientific judgements on the occurrence of obesity and pregnancy in order to take timely interventions.
For adolescents who have already become pregnant, it is strongly recommended that, in addition to the promotion of food and movement in science, adolescents should avoid the use of hunger or half-life treatment to control and reduce body weight, and that they should not be deliberately used to reduce pregnancy.

On 5 November, on the way through the old house, the Japanese Prime Minister of the Black Land indicated that it was aware that the long-term implementation of the overcrowding monetary policy could undermine the financial institutions' interest rate and could undermine the stability of the banking system in the country.
However, he indicated that, given the uncertainty of low inflation and the uncertainty of foreign economies, Japan needed to maintain its large-scale incentive plan and to pay close attention to the benefits of its policy.
" The Japanese Centre fully recognizes that under the continuing money-laundering, financial institutions will be increasingly affected by the power of the financial institutions, " in a speech by the People ' s Republic of Montenegro on behalf of the leaders of businesses.
He said that if financial institutions were more actively taking risks in order to compensate for the impact of low interest rates over the years, and when serious negative shocks occurred, the banking system could be active.
" While these risks are not high at present, the Centre will focus on developments and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures " , he said.
The record of the Japan Central Conference, which was published earlier this week, shows that the Committee on Central Policy discussed the growing cost of long-term relaxation policies at its September meeting.
The record of the meeting shows that if the economy continues to expand, " the future of Japan ' s centre has more pluralistic space in policy. "
The record of the meeting showed that another member stated that, given its limitations during the policy period, the Committee should discuss how long Japan ' s centre could sustain policies.
The East Bank claims that Japan will assess the financial risks posed by the policy of relaxation, while taking into account the uncertainty surrounding Japan ' s economic prospects, which may affect global needs due to trade patterns and increasing protectionism in Central America.
" The impact of such problems on Japan ' s economy is temporary, " claims the East Bank.
" But how the issue continues, the impact on Japan ' s economy may be significant," he added.
" There is a need for a strong monetary reconciliation policy to be pursued on an ongoing basis, while considering positive and negative effects in a balanced manner " .
Despite the increase in the cost of promotional plans, as long as the long-term low rate of interest rate increases the benefit of financial institutions, the decline has forced Japan ' s capital to maintain the plan.
Japan ' s monthly monetary policy is maintained; the risks posed by global trade disputes are excluded from the possibility of recent rise in the Black Sea.

In this context, correct areas of misconscientiousness, undermines the thinking of entrepreneurs, puts businesses at the heart of development, and encourages the Government to develop, with market confidence and development expectations, with particular profound realities.
The conference once again stressed the important conclusion of "Three unchanged": "The status and role of the non-public economy in our economic development has not changed!"
From the in-depth promotion of simple political empowerment, the establishment of a power-listing system to a legal governance environment that protects the legitimate interests of entrepreneurs in the workplace, the creation of a fair competitive market environment, the creation of a society-wide respect for entrepreneurs, and in recent years, the importance of the central party for entrepreneurs, before the system's security forces are empty.
The Conference has made it more clear to support policy initiatives for the development of six major aspects of civil enterprises and to launch a series of operational actions aimed at "lightly advanced" civil enterprises.
All of this is very encouraging to business groups and more to society.
Deployment, the approach is defined, and the key is to implement.
To continue to build a better development environment for the civil sector, to help civil society enterprises address development difficulties, to contribute to achieving China's economic transition level; to make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, to feel safe in legitimate business, to respect and promote innovation and create potential in social life.
China ' s economic entry into the process of high-quality development requires more entrepreneurs to provide more space and performance for entrepreneurs.
We have reason to believe that with further deepening reform and overcoming obstacles, the civil economy will be confronted with better development prospects and development opportunities and will move towards a broader stage.

The U.S. Department of State subsequently stated that it would visit Korea in October to promote the implementation of Singapore's commitment to the Singapore Summit.
From the beginning of this year to the present year, Korea has broken the lines of dialogue between strong ice openers, Korea, the leaders of the United States, continue to continue the situation and the major trends in the peninsula, and the principles of the dialogue to address the question of the peninsula can also be strengthened.
First, the fact that "the nature of the question of the peninsula is a matter of security" has not changed, that it is good to achieve peace on the peninsula, that is, to balance the legitimate security concerns of the parties rather than focusing on peer pressure.
Secondly, in the dialogue to achieve the non-nuclearization of the peninsula, the various parties differed from the steps and ways of achieving the non-nuclearization of the semi-nuclearized island, and since there was a long lack of political confidence between the United States, the "who was the first to come" was the age-based attitude.

In contrast, Russian Foreign Minister Raffrov stressed the principle of " to respond to action " , which he noted: " The downward trend of sanctions should be the same as the step taken by Korea on the path towards a gradual withdrawal of nuclear weapons " .
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to be fully, fully and accurately implementing the Council's resolutions, but not to be pressured into implementing sanctions and promoting political solutions are the requirements of the Council's resolutions, which are indistinguishable and not just one.
In view of the positive progress made in the current relationship with the United States, as expressed by the Chinese State officials and the Foreign Minister, China believes that it is important for the Council to take into account the need for due consideration of the introduction of counter-terrorism clauses, thereby encouraging Korea and the parties concerned to take a greater step towards non-nuclearization.
Recalling the past, every step in the process of nuclear non-nuclearization and peace requires that all parties show sufficient political courage.
At present, the international community is increasingly looking forward to the promotion of political solutions to the peninsula, with particular political commitment, political determination, commitment to resolve difficult issues, continued progress towards a balanced approach, and progress towards the process of non-nuclearization with the establishment of a peace mechanism on the peninsula and the establishment of permanent peace on the peninsula.

However, the risk of the outbreak of a comprehensive trade war has been countered by the business prospects of enterprises, which may threaten business capital expenditure.
Live capital expenditure is a clear point in Japan's economy.
The survey raised questions about the economic expansion of Japan ' s central health line that would contribute to the acceleration of inflation to 2 per cent targets, although there is evidence that enterprises are gradually transferring costs to customers.
" In the event of the concern of the global trade war, the confidence of the manufacturers in export slows down and the poor production of the factory has slowed down, " the Director General of the Institute for Agricultural Central Research, South-Westphalia, said.
"Faith is still high, and since the profits of companies are improving and rising prices, I don't think that faith will continue to decline."
The short-term survey showed that the large-scale production-producing scenario was falling from 21 to 19 months ago, to a further deterioration in the third season.
The market's average value is 22.
The large non-conformity indicators of climate judgment decreased from 24 to 22 in September from June to 22 for the first time for eight seasons.
The road survey is on 22nd.
The survey showed that the large manufacturing and non-industrial benchmarks were stable in December.
Investors are not interested in the short-term business assessment index, which is based on the daily unit index.N225 increases to 27-year high points, helping to improve the future of Japanese business exports due to the continuing value of the day.
Capital expenditure is stable.
Despite the low confidence of enterprises, the latest short-term outlook shows a sound plan of enterprise capital expenditure, benefiting from renewable energy and increasing labour shortages against machine makers and automated investment in response to population ageing.
The central short-term short-term survey shows that large-scale enterprises are planning to increase their current capital expenditure by 13.4 per cent in March 2019.
The previous short-term survey was 13.6 per cent.
The South-Weapon stated that this financial year's capital expenditure is rising by 8.5 per cent, near the pace of the economic times of Japan.
He said, " Given that small enterprises have increased their expected gains from now on, capital expenditure continues to grow in space, which is largely dependent on the impact of trade wars on confidence in enterprises. "
A short-term survey shows that the capacity of enterprises to relocate costs is increased and that the number of large enterprises is positive 7, a high point for decades, which is an encouraging sign of progress towards Japan ' s efforts to combat inflation.
The number of indicators for measuring the employment situation of large enterprises and the burden of 23 which has been at the lowest level since 1992 is marked by a trend in the employment market.
Benefiting from firm expenditure on health, Japan ' s second economic year has been counter-suspending since 1 March this year.
However, the rise in trade patterns during the summer and the disruption of supply chains to natural disasters depended on the economic prospects of exports in Japan.
In the case of United States dollars, the rate of imports of services is 16.4 per cent.

Many institutions predict the price of oil will significantly increase and achieve " three-fold " .
The car owners who plan to drive out of the car may be able to fill in the car before the price is paid.
According to data from the census estimates, domestic oil is expected to be approximately 190 per tonne and 220 per tonne of the capital statement.

The domestic oil price is linked to the international oil price, which has continued to be investigated since the current round of international oil prices, after the fall in the amount of $80 per tonne of Brent oil.
As at 28 September, the United States of America received US$ 1.13 for the original oil supply and reported $73.25/pack.
The amount of US$ 1.0,2,72/tonne from the Brent oil supply.
" From the international situation, the US sanctions Iran has increased its tensions, the overall trend of oil prices, followed by a clear rejection of growth, market confidence and the steady movement of oil prices. "
In fact, it has been said that there is a need for more information about the future.
In terms of retail sales, current oil in Beijing, the oil price for oil stations 92 and 95 is 7.66 per cent and 8.15 per cent respectively.

First-school students made a mistake by the teacher's body, which involved the removal of the annual evaluation quality in the new network.
In response to the fact that "the first-year-old student was being punished by a teacher" incident, the official report of the New York City Board of Directors of the Ninth District reported yesterday that the fact that the case of students of the foreign language school RoXX has been confirmed has been transferred from the teacher's post and that the school is subject to an annual "equational " rating" qualification.
There were parents in the past, who reflected the widespread concern of the first six-year-old girl in the school because of having made a mistake in the field of mathematics at school.
Subsequently, the Social Affairs Agency of the New Southeast Region of Mining was set up a group of investigators in schools to investigate the relevant personnel, ask them to collect evidence and to transfer the teachers concerned from their place of school.
Last year, the official release of the Cincinnian New District Control Commission, Microbo, reported that there was a fact that RoXX, a master of foreign language school in China, was actually a criminal student.
After the study, the " one vote " , which was considered at the end of the year of primary foreign language school in Chechnya, was rejected.
It was also reported and claimed that a collective dialogue was held with the Administrative Branch of the Ministry of Foreign Language Schools in the state of Chechnya, which dealt with the management and division leaders according to the relevant provisions; the transfer of teachers to the teacher's position of RoXX and the serious treatment under the relevant provisions; the commissioning of a small foreign language school in the State of Xiao to conduct a thorough inspection and to take effective measures to eliminate such incidents.
At the same time, schools need to initiate communication with students ' parents and to deal with good follow-up work.
69th International Space Agency Open-up Network in Germany
New York Society did not come to the screen at the 69th International Space Agency on 1 October in Germany on 1 October and attended by more than 6300 astronomers from around the world, space agencies and business representatives, experts and youth students.
The President of the International Space Federation, Jean-Ef Legal, made a statement at the opening session that the global space industry was no longer a minority country and institutions, and that this year the number of participants increased significantly, indicating that more and more institutions and individuals are participating in it.
He called upon States to strengthen cooperation and innovation and to promote the development of space industry together.
The Deputy Minister for Industry and Information Affairs of China presented China ' s space plan in the presence of the National Space Agency, and indicated that China would expand international cooperation in the field of space and contribute to human space affairs.
China Space Technology Group companies, relevant agencies such as China Space Science Group companies and some representatives of civil enterprises have demonstrated the latest achievements in China's space, including various transport rockets, satellites and space technology applications products.
The International Space Conference has been held once a year since 1950 and is the largest meeting in the world's aviation environment.
The General Assembly has been co-organized for five days by the International Space Federation, the International Space Sciences Institute, the Mei University Centre for Science and Micro-Scientific Research, such as the International Space Law Institute.
According to a press release by China on Friday, 5 November, China's foreign trade centre had shown that China's foreign trade situation was still complex and 80.6 per cent of the companies expected to export year-on-yearly over the previous year or to maintain balance.
However, given the continued rising costs of integrated elements such as domestic materials, labour force, and the increased external environment of Central America's trade molluscs, the company's view is that the export situation is not pleasant for the next year.
At the 124th Chamber of Public Information closed press release, the Under-Secretary-General for Communications, a press speaker, stated that China ' s Deputy Chief of Foreign Trade Centre ' s Deputy Chief of the China Trade Centre had shown that the number and export volume of the purchasers from outside the Chamber was slightly lower than the number of participants.
The current buyers reached 189,812 persons from 215 countries and regions, with a decrease of 1.11 per cent.
Exports amounting to $2064.94 million (consisting $298.6 million), falling by 1%.
From the market , Japan , the Ten Asian States , the " Golden Four " , Korea accounted for 74.4 per cent , 11.4 per cent , 7.2 per cent , 2.5 per cent , the traditional markets , such as the United States , Australia , Canada and the EU , decreased 30.3 per cent , 8.9 per cent , 7.3 per cent , 0.8 per cent .
Industrially, transport tools, mechanical equipment, construction and packaging materials, electronic consumer goods and information products, protective equipment increased by 24.8 per cent, 21.1 per cent, 20.0 per cent, 15.1 per cent, and 7.6 per cent, clothing and household appliances by 13.0 per cent, 6.7 per cent.
The military indicated that, as a result of China's external trade rain chart and windmarks, the current situation and export data of broadband buyers showed that China's foreign trade development continued to face many uncertainties over the next year.
However, as the in-depth progress made towards structural reform and the ongoing policy measures in recent countries and local landlocked countries, such as “six stability”, new developments in foreign trade in China are accelerating, and business diversification is constantly making new progress, which are an important and powerful condition for foreign trade development.
" The integrated factors that are expected to maintain a stable growth in Chinese exports throughout the year and increase in quality and efficiency. "
The Chinese Customs Office published that the price of exports in September was 14.5 per cent higher than the growth, imports were 14.3 per cent higher than in September, trade was approximately $316.9 million, and exports were at the highest since February of this year.
Despite the continued rise in trade patterns in Central America, China's export performance in September remained extremely high, with the need to be abroad, the value of export price for the people's currency before the United States tax is added, or the main factors of interest, has also shown some degree of comparability in China's foreign trade, but the fight against confidence in the Central American trade, and the failure of the industrial chain to break down, and the analysis of Chinese foreign trade challenges may appear in four quarters or next year.
A road survey showed that the United States Fund, which recommended increased cash retention in September, continued to maintain a cautious position, with the introduction of the latest round of import tariffs in the United States and China and that there was no calm sign of the dispute.
However, according to the 12 management recommendations of the Fund involved in this survey, the increase in North America ' s assets has been at the highest since June 2017 and the fall in the euro area, particularly in the emerging markets.
The global stock adjustment is 56.6 per cent , the debt ratio is 35.5 per cent , which is basically consistent with the previous month ' s survey.
Its most obvious change is that the cash ratio rose to 5.1 per cent, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager of a large fund company stated that " some economic data have led to market confidence, but trade wars are still the greatest concerns, so it is best to be prepared to enter the market when it comes back. "
However, in September the Fund managed the best shares, in particular the United States shares, even if the United States shares were considered to be high.
Today, in China's open-label sea, the first major national exhibition on the subject of imports — China's International Import Museum, which is expected to officially take the screen off from the world.
An event is like a window, which gives the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through this "window " , people see " open China " at the highest level; thanks to the "open China " window at the entrance , they welcome the victory between the world and the "open reform" of China.
" For a country, open as if it had been broken down, although it would have been a time of pain, it would have changed into a new life. "
A summary of the road to open access was provided by the close-to-pearl Repubblika Ping, which gave an important reason for China ' s "Why It Is Possible".
Recalling the 40 years of reform, it was difficult to reach China, the Great Lakes of the World Market, despite the drought and storms, to continue to face all the risk challenges and to be free from internal energy and to continue to increase competitiveness.
It can be said that China has been able to explain the values and meaning of openness with its own sincere achievements.
At the beginning of the new history, a major decision-making initiative by China to launch a new high-level open-air initiative to open the world market in support of economic globalization and trade liberalization was the real action by China to show "the open door of China will not be closed and only the strong and clear will" will be enhanced.
In contrast, the country's " demand " , the largest sure and best response to China ' s wider and wider scope, is to develop an open economy at the deeper level.
More importantly, the current global trade order has reached a cross-border route.
Some countries have built a high wall of trade protectionism, repatriated the path of unilateralism, increased the international community's concern about the prospects for free trade, and added a number of uncertainty to the ever-increasing world economy.
In the context of such a period of time, this summit of Cyprus represented China's protection of free trade, making the world see an open market and sharing the confidence of China itself and China in the future.
Get out of here. Get out of here.
China's greed, the hold of the world, has not only contributed to its development but also brought to the countries and regions of the world a " Chinese opportunity " .
In recent years China has provided a series of international public products to promote and promote " one-way " , to launch the creation of a " single road " , to set up a " fast-paced " vehicle " , to provide real-state export markets, development opportunities and jobs and to enable companies to combine China ' s " fast-growing " vehicle " .
It is also a public product such as a large global trading cooperation platform.
On this platform, more than 130 companies from more than 3,000 countries and regions with a variety of quality products and services highlight a new step in China's market.
In addition to national enterprises, domestic consumers benefit.
Through the development of this "choice improvement" platform, multi-channel quality supplies have been provided for consumer upgrades to meet the needs of the peoples for individualization, diversification and diversification of consumption needs.
As China’s open door expands, it is becoming more and more popular and it is becoming more stable in its use.
From a more objective point of view, the significance of the forum has gone beyond the scope of economic and trade, but in the future, it is open, inclusive, well-balanced, balanced and shared ideas that form a common consensus in response to today's challenges.
The world is good, China is good; China is good, the world is better.
We look forward to the future of the World Cup for beauty and satisfaction; we look forward to the bright future of the world's "open China" and the higher-level "opening world" community for human life.

More than nine percent of Brazilian women's voters claimed that the presidential candidate did not consider women's needs.
According to the South American News Network, recent data published by the Institute of National Geographic Studies in Brazil (IBGE) show that more than 90 per cent of Brazilian women do not consider women ' s needs to be considered by the presidential candidate.
It is reported that the number of women in Brazil has now reached 10.7 million and that if women from all parts of Brazil are gathered together into a country, the population of that country will be ranked global 13 and more than twice the national population of Spain.
In Brazil, the number of female voters is 52 per cent of the total number of voters and 48 per cent of men are 48 per cent, although women are very high among voters, only 10 per cent are women in Brazil's national parliaments.
Of the 193 countries in the world, the participation of Brazilian women in politics is only 154, higher than in the Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of human rights struggle, women in Brazil have not been able to obtain their own rights.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori (Natalia Mori) noted that this phenomenon was due to the effects of the common role of ancient patriarchal societies, racism and capitalism.
"Politicals should be democratically democratic of civil rights, identity, access to public products and the same society as many social groups.
A study previously conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Car Studies (Locometiva) also noted that 94 per cent of Brazilian women did not think that political people who had been elected could not represent their rights, 90 per cent of Brazilian women did not agree with the decisions made by politicians and 93 per cent of women did not agree with the current government ' s governance policy.
"We need to reverse the problem of women's representation in Parliament, and the political system of Brazil is still affected by inequality. To date, there are serious gender, class and racial discrimination in the political area of Brazil.
Although women ' s rights are inadequate, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
According to the survey, 76 per cent of women felt that they could be represented in the democratic elections and 72 per cent of women were interested in politics.
In addition, 55 per cent of women believe that democracy is the best way to bring women under less prejudice.

The T2 airport was officially opened on 30 days.
The ECOWAS record noted that the new airport could meet the needs of 12 million passengers per year after the opening of the new airport and build new air traffic preferences in the woods, making it important for further improvement of the broadband network, the shipping of the seas, the waterway and the entrance to the "four" modern system of transport.
This year, it is estimated that 9 million people will be killed by tourists in the jungle.
The T2 International Airport and the plant expansion project of the T2 airport are a major public benefit project for the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Basilica Self-Government Region, as well as a landmark project for the international tourism site of the Forest.
The project was launched in December 2015, with a construction of 100,000 square metres, total investment of $32.58 million, with an annual growth of 12 million after start-up and a decrease of 1012 million and a demand for 950 million tons of mail.
On that day, two hundred flights arrived at T2 International Airport in Berlin.
The design of the new airport is sensitive to the rain forests of the mountains, and it is seen as a "mountain of water", a view of the "London Park" and the houses of the northern population.
It is reported that the new airport in Berlin can meet the high-speed flow of almost 4,000 people every hour to enter ports and apply intelligently separated systems, secure the platform, identify the airport, and plan a wide range of business areas such as food, goods, tax and recreation.
As the growth in Asia and the emerging markets in Europe cannot be encouraging, the United States is increasingly becoming the main driver of global economic growth.
On 23 September 2018, New Jersey, U.S.A., a warehouse truck stopped inside the port.
However, as the current growth in the United States has benefited from a reduction in the financial incentive for tax, the country ' s economy has also been deeply concerned by the outside world.
"As the United States returns to full employment, the economy is at its worst. "
He said that the only problem was when it would happen and that he seemed that he might not move on.
Despite a positive outlook on the economic prospects of the United States before the end of this year, the Bank recognized that it was more difficult to predict for longer periods of time.
" In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost the potential for economic growth, the current growth encouraged by financial policy will be difficult to follow, " says economists in a study.
" While there is no investment growth, the economic risk of land undermining in 2020 will rise," they said.
A series of business surveys will show that major economies are at the economic cycle stage at the end of the third season.
The Eurozone and the United States manufacturing surveys, which will be published next week, will be concerned and the third will be published.
However, the focus of the next week will be on the United States non-agricultural employment data that will be published in the next five weeks, which will provide guidance on whether the labour market in question is moving towards a significant increase in wages.
Its importance is not only because of its purchasing capacity for profits and consumers for businesses but also because of the increase in wages or the rise in overall inflation, which may cause the officials of the United States Federal Reserve Commission (USF/FED).
" The pay will be taken into consideration, as it may increase significantly over the previous month.
The increase in the same period may not be three per cent over September, but we can expect a break in the following month, "The International Group of Economicists (ING) of the Netherlands wrote in a study.
While the release of vacations in China and other parts of Asia has led to clear weekly data under the region, the European Political Office may be a source of market fluctuations.
The Italian Government's financial commitment to the EU before it was taken into account will have to decide quickly whether other EU Member States would be strongly opposed to that decision in Italy.
As Britain's return to Europe enters a key stage, the British Conservative Party may also fire its fourth annual meeting in Berlin.
At the same time, the concerns of the emerging markets are not very likely to be reduced as the presidential elections are scheduled at the end of next week in Brazil.

The head of this moon centre said they were the only one of all five-star moon centres in the city of Giazin, which had been certified by the B level.
" Although some customers do not initially understand the meaning of B certification, it is important for long-term enterprise development to benefit customers through certification of the process that forces firm standards. "
The Deputy Director-General of the National Markets Controls Division confirmed that the certification of services is based on customer awareness and that a new type of certification system for quality management and service performance is an important component of national quality infrastructure, which is a key component of quality improvement services and has a positive role to play in enhancing international competitiveness of Chinese services.
Since the beginning of 2004, my country has experienced a lack of and progressive development of service certification projects, such as financial services certificates, maternity care certificates, post-marketing services certificates, e-commerce certificates, health services certificates with certain effects, etc.

In other words, if the price is restored, the first impact of its collapse will be on the people who are working in the city during the high season, but it is expected that there will be an urgent decline in prices such as during the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and that there will be very little opportunity for the citizens to reduce the price of the sale industry.
In a briefing to the High-level Board of Governors at the Legislative Conference on the Status of Tendhage, it was stated that, if it was recognized that the city had entered the downturn cycle, it could be allowed to continue on time.

Systemic red blood cells are a long-lasting and multicellular disease, which has been called " maladies " in the past.
Due to its inconsistencies, it is difficult to resolve doubts and lack effective treatment methods.
In recent years, the United Nations Group of Directors of the Institute of Life Sciences of the University of Chicago and the Center for the Prevention of Immunization of the People's Hospital of Beijing have found that there is an increased incidence of systemic erythema, which is involved in the transmission of immunization B cells.
In short, two groups have confirmed that one of the most unusual immunities in the human body is the underlying cause of systemic red blood cell disease.
According to one of the authors of the article, the North American People ' s Hospital has reported that the group has collected and conducted studies of systemic red blood cell patients, such as close to 2000 and has found that there has been a significant increase in the incidence and severity of
Several research methods, such as animal testing and testing, have been identified by 600,000 groups of these immunizers, which have changed their way of detecting active immunization signals, and have contributed to the spread of B cells by various mechanisms of self-resistance.
The journalists were aware that the two groups were strong and well equipped to make their own advantages and to achieve a close link between basic research and bed application.
The Group is committed to the identification of B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-
" This study is one of the results of two teams' multi-year cooperation, and it is also the first time that the academic community has recognized in the mechanism that immune proteins will often develop systemic red cells, setting a solid basis for further academia studies and sleep-related treatment.

It's not short, it's legal.
Lawyer's wearing the head of the court?
The news was really exciting, and it blew up in the legal circle.
The Law of the City of Fountain later applied for a fine of $500 for the lawyer concerned and recommended in writing that the City Law Association deal with investigations.
And according to the New China News, the city council of the former state of Hong Kong issued a formal statement that the conduct of the two lawyers did not involve violations of law and that they were not punished under the law.
It is reported by many that the treatment of the city council in Hong Kong is not short-term or contradictory, but has been approved by the state court.
Together with events that may have caused tension within the legal community, it was finally well resolved.
The reverse, from a more complete truth, is also based on the same type of co-operation between the lawyer's head and the defendant's vehicle and the same type of murder, but not on the same basis, which is only evidenced by the evidence round of evidence and without fear of the "risk security of the court".
The decision on whether or not the act of counsel is illegal and four very important details need to be taken: for one thing, the local court has not been able to contact the judge; for one thing, the entire head has not been raped or misused; for the other, the lawyer has been publicly convicted and apologized to the court for the first time.
In combination with these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyer concerned has nothing to do with bringing the court to trial, just to protect himself.
After clarifying the whole fact, the City Council of Hong Kong did not waterproof it but decided to refrain from punishment.
This decision was also tested by facts and law.
In the absence of a court permit, it would be easy to cause insecurity and misunderstanding as a weapon of control.
In view of security and caution, the previous penalties and judicial recommendations of the House of Commons are also ineligible.
In order to protect the dignity of lawyers, to prevent the personal court from having failed lawyers, the highest law was issued in 2014 " the rules for the security of the judicial police of the Court of People ' s Court " , setting out the principles that the court does not need to conduct personal security checks.
Since the issue of the rule, a wide range of lawyers have been acting in a way that has rarely been affected by incidents of security at the Tribunal ' s safety due to the security of the breach.
In such very special cases as the United States, there is no difficulty in eliminating misunderstanding if one has respect for one another, understanding, and understanding.
The Law Association, as a self-law organization in the counsel industry, carries on a double mission to punish and guarantee illegality.
In the past, individual law enforcement organizations have been more focused on punishment, lack of security, and are suffering from infectious diseases.
However, the decision of the United States Law Association, whether from the process or from the outcome, is worthy of commendation and has set a pattern for more law-making.
Since 1 October, what tax benefits will affect our wallet?
The New York Times Act on 1 October will be implemented on 1 January 2019 for the benefit of the general public as soon as possible of reduced tax benefits by 1 October and will take place first on the basis of the 5000 points of reference received by the taxpayers from 1 October and apply the new tax rate table.
What are the benefits of being together with the new settlement?
Good I: The tax cuts paid by payers are clear
After 1 October, taxable taxpayers were able to remove the basic reduction costs of $5,000/month and apply a new tax rate table, most taxable persons had different levels of tax reductions, particularly those with low income.
According to the tax reduction table for different income groups, the decrease of the monthly income after "three-risk" is shown to be 8,000 dollars, 10000 dollars, 20000 dollars, 50000 dollars, and the tax rate should be adjusted by 90 dollars, 290 dollars, 1590 dollars, 9090 points, and 73.9% respectively, 61.1%, 49.0%, 18.8% respectively.
It is worth noting that for reasons of the holiday season, a new basic reduction of costs and tax rates could be applied by the units which were due to be issued by law at the end of September.
In order to do so, the tax sector-based contracting client software that has been used uniformly has provided the corresponding tax function, but the corresponding tax is still to be reported during the statutory reporting period.
Good two: the low rate record is clear.
In addition to raising points, a new tax rate table will be applied from 1 October.
The current salary, which has been paid, has not changed, but has changed significantly, 3 per cent, 10 per cent, 20 per cent, and 25 per cent, and 35 per cent, and 45 per cent of these three higher rates remain unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the rates of taxes received from production operations, with a maximum rate of 35 per cent higher than $100,000 to $5 million.
This means that individual businessmen will benefit from tax change.
" From an early point of view of the individual tax reduction estimates for senior managers, the benefits of tax reform, particularly those of low-income groups, will be clearly evident. "

According to the press report, the Canadian Government ' s website, France and the United States of America, which published a joint statement by the Foreign Minister of Canada on behalf of Latvia, has reached a triangular trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico, which will be called " USMCA " (the United States of America Agreement).
Earlier, Canada's CTV News television station had called on high-level United States news users to resolve their differences and reach agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
" Washington Post " refers to the information received by two informed persons that the agreement reached by the United States and Canada on 30 September would retain the North American Self-Trade Agreement as a Tripartite Trade Agreement and the new agreement would be signed by the Heads of State within two months.
The statement states: " Today, Canada, the United States and Mexico have agreed to a new trade agreement — the USMCA (USMCA), the " three-country agreement" will provide high-standard trade agreements for our workers, farmers and companies, which will promote a more free market, fairer trade and more sustainable economic growth. The agreement will strengthen the middle-income level, create high-paying opportunities and create new opportunities for about 50 million people. "
It was reported that the current Free Trade Agreement was signed by the United States, Mexico and Canada in 1994.
After the announcement of the President of Tranunpur, the plan was to re-examine the agreement and sign a new agreement.
The negotiation process has been initiated by three countries since 2017.
As a result of the earlier outbreaks of Xerxes' disease before the death of H.E., the local election resulted in the publication of the results of the first day of June, which was successful in opposing the U.S. base migration plan.
This election was held on 30 September, with a result that 39.66.3 million votes were taken together, the most important of which was the historic vote in the country, and more than 8 million votes were voted against by the main voter.
There are four candidates participating in this election, 63.24 per cent of the vote, down from 0.89 per cent in 2014 than in 2014.
On 1 May, the city indicated to the media that the results of the elections showed that the people of the Republic of Korea did not want to let the President know what was before his life and that he would inherit the will of the President and continue to work towards the Government of Japan and the Government of the United States of America against the U.S. base travel plan and the closure of the inter-day base.
The U.S. military base has been in the wild city of Sukong, and has been sick since. The Government of Japan has previously agreed to move it to the border areas of the city of refuge, but the people of Shuang are strongly opposed and hope that it will be completely excavated.
On the other hand, with regard to a highly opposed migration plan and the request for the removal of the coastal archipelago to fill the seabed, the City of Khi indicated that he had not, at first, been in a position to stand up and divide the central government, hoping that the parties could exchange their views fully and demonstrated their intention to be resolved through consultations.
The Prime Minister of Japan expressed his concern to the media at 3 p.m. that this outcome would be taken seriously and that efforts would be made to revive the flow and reduce the base burden.
At a press conference on 1 day, the Chief of Staff, Japan, stated that there had been no change in the Government ' s approach to the move to the United States military base as soon as possible.
At the same time, he expressed his desire to talk to the city.
The city will be officially informed on 4 May.
Since the mid-2000s, as China's demand for oil has grown, it has grown to grow more and more crops in Paul Thomas, North Dakota, U.S.A.
This change reached the highest peak this year, which he produced in 5,000 pounds [1,600 kg] of copper and reached an unprecedented size.
But Thomas and many farmers like him planned to transfer food from the former U.S. agricultural area: rice and corn in 2019.
This year American farmers grow more than half a ton of corn and for the first time in 35 years.
It is therefore planned to transfer other food crops because, in the context of the start of the trade war against China, U.S. farmers are facing difficulties.
China usually buys about 60 per cent of U.S. exports of cotton, but in recent months almost zero purchases of U.S. cotton have resulted in a decline in the price of cotton to 10 years.
Thomas intends to increase the size of the next year and hopes to increase a number by reducing the dependence on crops dependent on China's needs.
Thomas said that the big price of beer " brought us a painful fight " .
He said that there was no need to buy China, the present price of cotton near its farm was $7.10 per litre, while the required cost was $8.50.
This year, American farmers create high levels of high-quality seed plants and are expected to produce high-quality records.
At such a time when it was easy to get hit, they had a fight for trade.
In July, China added import tariffs to the United States of America for imports of Chinese goods.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will publish the first forecasting report on crops for the coming year, which will include an assessment of the impact of tariffs.
It is expected that the forecast will confirm the expectation that civil institutions will reduce the presence of largepox.
According to a road-based report, Information Economics is expected to increase by 4 to 9.7 million pounds (37.5 million kilograms) in 2019 and to reduce by 7 to 8 million pounds (7 to 8.3 million pounds).
Information is also expected to increase by 4%.
This year, the gross fines that were raised before the implementation of the reimbursable tariffs increased to 896 million pounds and increased by about 10 million pounds.
Since 2008, there has been less than 5 million pounds [5 million pounds], up to 89.1 million pounds [4.7.8 million pounds] of corn plants this year, reaching a minimum rate of nearly 100 years.
Aron Carlson, head of the Ilynoi State Coat Plant Association, collects a total of 3,600 pounds [300 kg] of plants from his home, which he will use nearly half of this year to grow crops, but plans for a reduction in the future.
He said that there could be a 20 per cent increase in the farm where he lived in northern Illinois, where he grew up to 20 per cent; the state was the largest state in the United States of America.
The growth rate of the seeds is lower than that of wheat, but the need is less than that of wheat, which is generally lower than that of wheat.
A farmer's transfer to the final value meter may increase costs, but it will benefit some businesses, including Andersons Incl.
Andersons, Executive Director Pat Bowe, points out that he is expected to have a turnover of mercury that will benefit from dehydration.
Biar is expected to benefit from a farmer's transformation.

New York International Time Review: Protecting multilateralism and China's knowledge
Under the unilateral revolutionary movement, international rules and multilateral order were violated.
To some extent, unilateralism and multilateralism have entered a critical period.
As a responsible major country, China has a large position, a shared concept and a powerful action in the broad way, and together with the international community to maintain multilateralism and to promote the continuation of multilateralism.
Faced with new challenges in the new situation, China sent a clear voice on the development direction and ways of multilateralism.
As the Secretary-General and the Minister for Foreign Affairs had said in the general debate of the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, modern multilateralism should continue to work together to overcome the goal of cooperation on the basis of a rule-based order with a view to fair justice and to lead effective action.
At the same time, China called for the construction of the United Nations core, for North-South cooperation, for additional global development cooperation bodies for South-South cooperation, and for the creation of a cooperative community for human life.
China ' s thoughts and voices reflect the leading voice of the international community.
As stated by the 73rd President of the General Assembly, Espinosa, under the current situation, " the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and maintain an international system based on rules " .
The President of the International Monetary Fund, Lagad, said that the international community should continue to maintain the multilateral trading system and maintain international trade rules through consultations to resolve differences.
In recent years, a number of emerging markets and groups of developing countries have played a greater role in international major multilateral mechanisms in providing new development forces for anti-competitive multilateralism.
Standing at this level, China's advocacy for building a large family rather than a small circle of co-building, and maintaining a multilateralismal concept such as that of the conquerors, in line with the age-old flood, is a response to global challenges and a solution to the world's difficulties, representing the common demand of most countries in the world.
There's a forward-looking idea, a more realistic approach.
China's "one-way" initiative has become the largest international cooperation platform.
China ' s joint " one-way " , the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the International and Regional Cooperation Initiative " 16+1 " , promotes cooperation in the international region and complements existing international systems and order and contributes to innovation for multilateral cooperation and contributes to a more equitable approach to development in order to promote international order.
China ' s actions are increasingly powerful at this multilateral United Nations stage as international defenders and practitioners of multilateralism.
Round international hotspots, climate change response, participation in peacekeeping operations, massive poverty alleviation and assistance to other countries in the implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.
As Secretary-General of the United Nations said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the world's "trust deficit" has been intensified, nationalism and anghast trend is the most urgent time in the world for multilateral cooperation.
In such historical contexts, the international community needs to step up, concocted into action, firmly protecting multilateralism and promoting the construction of a community for human life.

A quick review of this video is being made: this is the first day of the Memorial of the Protection of the Heroes of My Nation.
Five years ago, the Memorial Day was established in the spring of the country, showing the great events of the Chinese people from the difficult way to the desert, and we need to warn the moment: " Where are we from? Where are we going? "
The book of Near Pépé notes with deep appreciation that " abandoning tradition, disappearing is basically like breaking your soul apart " .
"Don't forget about the future. "
We still worship the hero, remember the Lord, to remember history forever, to continue with the spirit of wisdom, to gather together the powerful forces of the return of the people.
A quick review indicates that Britain is the capital of the nation.
Honorable Lord and High Priest, it is to make our glory glorious, holy, eternal memory worthy of our sincere praise.
According to incomplete statistics, there are about 2000 million people who are victims of national independence, people's freedom and national strength, and people's lives are being blessed with courage.

Every year, countless people flock to the garden of honor, allowing us to experience the profound sentiments of the populace and feel the excitement generated by the rise in national blood.
He's a hero. He's a hero. He's a hero. He's a hero. He's a hero. He's a hero.
Finally, it was concluded that today, in China's new era of special socialism, we can tell the British under the sky that a strong China is rising east, and the Chinese people's huge resurgent dreams are becoming real in our hands.
Let us move forward with the spirit of wisdom, towards the grand goal!

The fifth "Sustained Moon" came to focus on the problem of disability in youth education -- a new network.
In recent years, the issue of adolescent education in China has been discussed widely, but the challenges remain difficult for young people ' s education.
In recent days, a workshop on comprehensive education and practical strategies for disabled persons was held in Beijing.
How to conduct sexual education for disabled children and young people as an important topic of this seminar.
The "Special Knowledge of Disabled Children and Young People in China, attitudes and behaviour reports" presented evidence that children with disabilities are more likely to suffer sexual harassment and sexual abuse than are healthy children.
In the case of disabled children, adolescents are also more concerned about "sexual protection" in society.
The seminar aims to provide support from family support, school education and institutional services in three areas of the promotion of comprehensive education for disabled children and adolescents in China, from the source of support for disabled children and adolescents, and to give them the right to love as their neighbors.
Experts believe that China ' s public awareness of disability groups has long remained at an insufficient level.
The effects of traditional views on disabled people, especially disabled children and adolescents, are still not sufficiently profound in China.
In recent years, however, with the support of UNESCO and the public, there has been a happy development of sexual and reproductive health education for Chinese persons with disabilities throughout the entire cycle.
The "report" shows that obstacles, barriers to vision, hearings, mental and physical barriers to children and young people's access to sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relations may be more difficult than common ones, but in general, they have made it easier to accelerate and enrich development.
"Comprehensive School of Education for Persons with Disabilities and Practice Seminar" is organized by the Public Welfare Foundation of the Overseas Sea, the UNESCO Office of the United Nations Office at Vienna, the International Union of Disabled Persons (France) Office of the United Nations Population Fund in Beijing, and the United Nations Office at Headquarters, with the support of the United Nations High Strategy for Health Canada, with a view to discussing gender-based and reproductive health education practices and ways to promote policy makers in the field of special education and integration of education, educators, researchers, social services organizations and stakeholders; and the right to health of children and young people with disabilities to comprehensive education; wide-ranging exchanges on domestic disability and youth education, strategies, challenges and resources, as well as on how to develop comprehensive education on the future of disability and youth, and the development of support networks.
On 30 September - The Chinese Central Bank's publication of net data on short-term flows of foreign assets revealed that as at the end of August this year, foreign currency was zero for the remaining 12 months of the long-term long-term contract and cargo contracts.
This previous data show that as at the end of August last year, foreign currency had been held at $60.44 million for the current long-term contract and freight contracts, which remained unchanged for the fourth month; an empty capital size of SDR 42.76 million was estimated at the end of August.
After that, the distance from the central line has always been zero.
The central line first published the data at the end of March 2016; data show that foreign currency in the central line at the end of February 2016 amounted to more than $24.38 million for the current long-term contract and freight contract, with an empty head of $289 million.
The data published at the end of October of the same year, the net increase of $164.1 billion to $453.1 billion was first reported.
The Central Bank has previously indicated that the long-term and long-term capital of foreign currency reflects in particular the conduct of the foreign exchange securities exchange operations carried out with the commercial bank, which will continue to provide long-term insurance products in accordance with the principle of necessity, with a smaller impact on future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of 20 September this year, K158 cars were on their way to the wall of a third-party joint school car in Chechnya.
One of the grandparents who bought a car without a ticket, she took her seat: " Take a picture " .
Two hours of driving and one hour of driving took him off.
Finally, a man's passenger in the car doesn't look down and pick up a giant.
From the point of view of the fact that, although most of the latter were condemned by the public, convicted by the public sector, and even included in the list of honest faiths, the public still felt that "no objection " was not possible: why could it not be punished?
Why can't the place stop its immorality or even illegal acts, but then be punished?
And why is it that only a man's passenger "sees the wrong way" to raise it?
The main reason for this is that only on long-distance vehicles have multiple police and short-distance vehicles are not generally available; even if there are multiple-deck police, the police are concerned about the possible non-reactivation of residents and do not take compulsory exit measures.
The incident of the massacres made it clear that it was necessary for the fugitives to be forced to leave their places of detention and even to be punished.
This requires that our motorcycling police be bold to take strong measures at the right time and that without police vehicles be set up as soon as possible in order to ensure that they stop and combat violations at the right time.
On 1 October, on the first day of the holiday, the President of the country went to the North Ouagadougou Self-Government of the North Sea to increase his vehicle along the coast.

"At the time of entry into the control line there was a thousand vehicles, which were expected to arrive at about 15 hours in the North Sea after contact with 120 emergency vehicles. "
The Chief Chief of the North Sea Police reported on the need for an ambulance on the road from the Danube River, and on the road to the coastal shore, to prevent double-tracked vehicles that have already entered the railway line, to be sent to the police an hour earlier on the road, the last three points of control of the vehicle, and to remind all approved crew members of the road to open the wrong road for rescue vehicles.
Subsequently, the civilian civilian police were encouraged to temporarily stop the vehicle from entering the control line, which led to the arrival of 120 emergency vehicles.
At 15 hours, a U.S. rescue vehicle entered the North Sea, and the North Sea sent a police car on its way to the control line.
It was understood that only one vehicle could be adopted in the area around the lake and that the civilian police had taken temporary control of these sites and had guaranteed 120 emergency ambulances successfully.
When the village of Teneri was reached, there was a road that could not be misinformed, which would result in prior contact with the two village commissions, borrow the village road and prevent social vehicles from entering.
"From the North River police to 120 emergency ambulances to access 302 regular roads only 40 minutes. "
The report states that, according to the normal situation, it takes four hours for the whole time.
"This arrangement has succeeded in getting valuable treatment time for patients."
It was reported that at 1720 hours patients were sent to the hospital for rescue.

"This money was taken from the passenger clothes."
The police pointed to a broken outer pocket saying: "They broke up here and stole 800 of a Beijing passenger, and when we caught them, the money just got into their own pockets. "
The reporters realized that in order to get these two people, the police had enough clothes for an hour and finally caught one while they were doing their case.
Two suspects are currently receiving a police review.
The issue is simple for the public police.
"The more the thief gets caught, the more their eyes, the more they see, the different behaviour and the more common passengers, the more they like to be among people, not hiding away from people. "
The police also told reporters that suspects often had no purpose in driving, and that they liked to swim at the parking lot and that they would end up on the road only after finding the object of the undercar crash.
"These are all stories of experience, so it's been a long time, of course. "
In addition, the police also pointed out that " the best thing to do is to put things out of clothes and get them out of hand. "

In recent years, this report (True Journalist Liquor) has had many instances of improper school dances.
To that end, the Ministry of Education announced that new national markings were required to be carried out at the primary school-based level of materials used after 1 November this year.
Compulsory national standards "Academic-based field of materials-based movements " were organized by the Ministry of Education, 26 institutes and testing agencies were involved in drafting, during more than two years of revisions, during which more than 100 expert meetings were held, as well as country-wide field surveys, sample testing, and the collection of countless evidence of hundreds of business products on the market.
On the basis of the 2005 mark, the press found that the new country ' s brands not only became " national standards " as " national mandatory standards " , but also increased many elements, including rigid requirements, physical capacity, ageing capacity, non-metallic content requirements, the protection of the content of high-temperatures, the level of material that is harmful to surface components, and the level of non-solid and solid materials that are harmful.
In particular, it is worth noting that the new country has limited the potential harmful substances in the construction of the school yard corridors and has increased from 7 to 18 from the originals and has provided for the operational limits for post-construction vehicles according to domestic standards.
For example, "the volume of harmful substances and the requirements for the release of harmful substances in present-type and pre-preventable-type components" clearly provides for the release of substances not exceeding 5 mg/litres, not exceeding 0.4 mg/litres, not exceeding 7 mg/litres, not exceeding 0.1 mg/litres and not above 3 levels of nitrogen.

Dining and Juju are friends of the team and friends, both of whom are familiar with each other’s technical skills.
Whether they're ready or they're hot before the game, they're both like a picture.
In the decision-making process, at least two of them have indicated that they have completed the competition.
But there is a greater degree of competition between tinnitus and rain, known as lightning.
In the first place, the experience of the Great Lakes is a three-way process, followed by a 3-phase failure of rainwater.
Later, there began to be an increase in the failure of the attack, and Tinni took the opportunity to take the lead at 3 o'clock 9:5 and at 10:6 p.m.
Dinny is still using the game at 11:9.
In the second place, the failure of Juju's rain continued to be high, thanks to the advantage between them at 6:1 a.m.
In the event of a fall of 2.7, it is based on a change of 2 minutes, and then the use of an attack will be divided into 8:9.
At 2 o'clock, T'inn won another round.
Thirdly, the two of us have to get up at 3:3 p.m.
Dinn then failed to increase the three-point link during the attack, but she then used the three-point line to track up to 6 degrees.
The rain is twice as good as it can be, and at 10:8 a.m.
But Dinn's attack was violent, and four minutes later, he took the third floor.
In the fourth floor, we got a 4.2 in front of the rain.
However, the latter showed a very strong state of attack, and four minutes later the rain stopped.
After a pause, the rain came back to a few conditions, and it would gradually be 8 feet [8.8 m].
It's a good time, Dinny's got no handshake, two minutes to get to the race.
As the rain comes down on the ball, Tinni's 4:0 against the enemy.
In the past month, Tinny won a public contest in Bulgaria and ended her 14-month-long championship, which ended, although she claimed that she had not set the goal of fighting this race before, but in the final half of the morning, Tinny said that she had completed her mission.
She expressed her satisfaction at her presentation: "It is important for every movement.
I didn't think of it before, just saying one place to go and decide whether to do it or not."
When the sister who was fighting in the capital received a card from her sister Juju, who did not complete her defense goal, about whether the people who saw her enthusiasm were going to make her feel like her, she said: "I think that the whole struggle I can deal with in the face of pressure is very great today, leading to the fact that she has not always found a show. "
Employed rural consumption, based on the standardized mechanism ' s clean-up market, leading health consumption needs and increasing access to agricultural consumption.
Data show that the potential for continued release of consumption of rural residents, the increase in the volume of local consumption for the first half of the year is 10.5 per cent and an increase in urban growth by 1.3 per cent.
In a village in the western part of a poor village, there was only one hotel in the village, and some goods seemed to have met, "Ginnfish" called "Giln Oil", "Wanji" became "Wanji" and "Sunji" goods.
In recent years, similar phenomena have appeared, some rural fake brand names, called near, packaged in the same way, have proved to be deceptive and inevitable.
A consumer survey report published in one Western city shows that rural merchants are serious about overcrowding and that 66 per cent of users have bought over-cooked goods under the urban line, of which over half the food is consumed.
The sector in question manages the rural market, year-on-year strikes, and why is the "Leagan" still going on?
In contrast to urban markets, the awareness of agricultural rights is relatively weak, as well as a number of rural areas, where control forces are limited enough to allow counterfeit goods to produce soil.
A commodity has a multi-heading price, a sectoral control price, a controlled production, a market, a functional shift, a year-on-year holiday, a focus on controlling a wind, a short walk away from the wind, a slow departure, an end to the old vacation, and a new holiday.
The lack of long-term control mechanisms, the difficulties of the rural market, the low cost of violations, and the high interest rate have led to the trafficking of some illegal traders into the brains of " mountain-based " and some rural areas become " waste markets " .
From winter to small health, large-scale farmers are focusing on developmental consumption.
Earlier in the day, the Central Party, the State Department, issued " a number of comments on improving the capacity of the consumer system for the further development of the consumer potential of the population " , which proposed the promotion of the increase in consumption of rural people with a view to enabling large-scale farmers to use " willing " consumption " and to make rural consumption more attractive.
In one way, there is a need for deeper reform, the elimination of multiple market regulation, multiple management of barriers, which are due to constraints, health-care security, product quality monitoring networks, and constant pressure on rural leave and the space for sale.
On the other hand, in order to increase law enforcement efforts to combat the " hairy bloodline " regulation, it is essential not to allow counterfeits to thrive in rural areas.
The severe punishment of farmers should not be a reason for the creation of counterfeit goods, but should be a matter of strict responsibility for the sector concerned, for which there is a low level of control, for which there is a need to take responsibility, for which there is no hiding place for counterfeiters.
Ensuring strict market access, rigorous quality review of producer operators, local market flows, direct access to products, clear roads, source sources, general thinking, secure business of legitimate vendors, and secure the security of farmers.
Active rural consumption needs to be guided by health needs.
With increased consumption, many farmers are not only looking for food, food, and a high quality life such as culture and health, but are unable to place rural markets with "low-quality " " price" pictures.
This needs to promote the expansion of e-commerce to large rural areas, the promotion of trade in electronic commerce, the combination of industrial development platforms and online trading platforms, and support the development of new patterns of consumption in rural markets; the creation of institutional links between trade flows and leisure agriculture, rural tourism and product processing; the healthy rural modern communications network system, the optimization of storage facilities resources and the effective reduction of rural transport costs.
The creation of a clean and market-friendly environment for rural farms, which keeps farmers from worrying about their consumption, has increased their rural consumption and has contributed to the awareness and happiness of farmers ' consumption.

This tax is mainly related to textile materials; stone materials, rubber, cotton; parts of iron and steel products; electrical equipment and parts thereof, such as metal processing machines, ironing machines, mechanical machinery, electrical equipment, electrical equipment, paperboards, etc.; resource goods and primary processing products such as non-metallic minerals, non-chemical materials, wood materials and paper products, precious stones.
At the same time, with the overall level of duty, in particular drugs, the daily rate of duty on imports of goods is reduced by the rate of duty on imports of goods.

The Committee from the State Bureau of Taxation was aware that since this year, following a continuous self-government adjustment, my country ' s overall rate of duty would fall from 9.8 per cent to 7.5 per cent last year and averaged to 23 per cent.
The appropriate reduction of tariffs is conducive to the promotion of the development of external trade balance, the promotion of higher levels of external openness, and the integrated use of two domestic resources in the international country and the promotion of structural reforms in the country.
The Committee ' s relevant officials indicated that this year was the 40th anniversary of reform and that the initiative to reduce the overall level of tariffs was to implement the practical action of the Secretary-General for the implementation of an important spirit of speech in the Asia Forum, as well as to increase openness on the basis of my country ' s own high-quality development, and to promote major import expansion initiatives, which indicated that China would not move towards a mutually beneficial open strategy, while enhancing its own development momentum, also making China's development better and better for the world.
On 29 September, the regional public goods card for agricultural products will be issued in the South-West district of Gandhi Province.
Red Army memes, black beads, mountain goats singing black sheep, hard teasing paper, handcuffs, handcuffs... ...and a full set of beautiful agricultural products on the show, they have a common card called "crowds."

The district border between the province of Zhangin Province and the " Chinese " Chinese " Chinese " film of " Chinese " , as " National Food Production " , has been a long and resource-increasing " .
The sheep's meat, honey's drink, cheese's face, the sweetest place to eat is more than the tastes he's ever thought of when he's hungry.
As the urbanization level in China grew, the urban population grew rapidly, and a large number of rural young people left the countryside began to live in urban areas.
China's Agricultural Card Study expert says well: "Now the city's life is fast and stressful, and more and more people are beginning to forget the life of the village for a little while, but, 'The most beautiful memory is village ', 'the roundabout' card design is named after the circumstances and the noises of the people who live outside. "
The weather conditions are special, the weather is long, the night temperature varies, and the special low-food conditions are unique.
There are more than 20 types of small-scale farm produce in the country, which is the main food source in China, which produces a quality in front of the country.
The King Lee was the daughter of a circuit girl who was in heaven who, as a volunteer, attended the presentation, she said: "The most beautiful family of the family, the most beautiful tastes of the family, the 'circuits' of ours have grown up to be so beautiful, remember, and remember the most beautiful food there, hoping that the 'crowds' card will go further and bigger. "
Dr. Güngen, researcher at the National Food and Material Reserve Institute of Sciences, said that by testing data for more than 900 indicators of the group, there was an increase in the quality of the raw materials and the preference of agricultural products such as black and white, and that many organic substances of the pasta were higher than standard data, and that the "survivors" had an advantage in the domestic high-temperature food market.
The Committee on the Environment notes that, through the release of "circuit" cards, it can further enhance the quality, standardization and scale up the level of innovation, contribute to the production of good overall images of CFP products and speedy increase in knowledge, competitiveness and added value.

Korea's first joint visit to the port in 65 years
The Ministry of National Defence confirmed that Korea had launched a joint survey on Hanun and Al-Qaida into the marine waters of the sea that day.
The initiative is an early preparation for ensuring the free navigation of both civil ships.
A communication from the Ministry of National Defence to the media that day revealed that it had been the first joint survey of Hong Kong entering the sea since the conclusion of the Korean War Stop Agreement in 1953.
Korea has signed a military agreement in September this year, agreeing that a joint visit will take place in the area of water such as the sea since November to ensure environmental protection for the water area and to develop tourism.
In October, Korea planned a joint water-related survey at the General Military Conference.
On 5 November, a joint visit to the Korean waters area was officially launched.
The joint mission is composed of 20 members of the Korean army, including experts.
According to the Ministry of National Defence of Korea, both parties were not carrying weapons during this investigation and were prohibited from using words that encouraged each other.
" Since there is no military demarcation near the sea, the region has been an emergency high point, but through joint visits, it will become a new zone of peace in the future. "
This area of the Korea Joint Research Area, the Director-General, approximately 70 km, totals some 280 square kilometres.
The Ministry of National Defence of Korea introduced that Korea would only conduct a survey of 6 ships at sea depth, providing basic information for the navigation of the water security area; after completion of the investigation, it would provide a guide map for the civilian ship only.
In October 2007, Korea held a summit meeting in San Juan and reached an agreement on the common use of Hunan and Al-Zin in the sea, but the follow-up to the negotiations was tense because of the situation on the peninsula.
In accordance with the military agreement signed by Korea in September, future ships need to be notified to each other only before they can travel in the common water zone.
On 5 November, the new Central Internet e-mail was released on 4 November, according to the Chinese Embassy website in Mongolia. In recent years, Chinese citizens have disappeared during tourism.
It was understood that two blue-day rescue team members, on 19 October, two of whom indicated that they had contacted their domestic friends to enter the mountains near Kusugul Lake, and had lost contact with them by sharing their location through micro-conference, which seemed to have gone unnoticed.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of legitimate rights and security of citizens in Mongolia and the protection and assistance of consultants.
Following the lack of information from the two visitors mentioned above, the station immediately launched a premise of emergency response, tried to take the money-saving time and to carry out its full work.
The mission maintained close contact with the family of the party, assisted the family immediately to report to the police and provided a translation list for the family to choose.
At the first time, the Mission met with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mongolia, the Chief of Police, the Chief of Emergency Administration, informed the relevant information, requested Montaparta to be rescued as soon as possible and to maintain close contact with Montaine during the search and to ensure that the latest progress was made in time.
At the same time, the mission assisted families to launch search in Monbo and to launch a wide range of active participation in the finders in Monwa and central finance companies, provide effective guidance, and provide relevant assistance to numerous blue-day relief teams assisting Lummon.
Under the great impetus of the embassy, Montague sent relief teams for the first time and committed to the elimination of rescue costs.
The Directorate-General of the Police and the Directorate-General for Emergency Situations directed the full rescue of the Police and Emergency Services of Kusugar Province.
Because of the fact that the Kusuguil Lake is located in northern Mongolia and the Russian border, it is far from the area, far from the area, and far from the people, the transport and communications are too scarce, and currently Mongolia is in severe cold, temperatures below 20 degrees Fahrenheit [20 ° C], the local police and emergency sectors have had a great deal of difficulty, almost all of the police are mobilized, and local shepherds, such as by horse mackerel, walking, visiting and visiting the two people, have been rescued around the lengths of the day.
At the same time, with regard to the special situation in the pastoral area, Montaine has been sending out searchers through the radio cycle for several days.
The staff of the National Blue Rescue Team have also been active in the rescue with Montapart.
The security of the two missing people has always touched our hearts.
Two of them have been missing for over ten days so far, allowing the settlement to continue to receive some lines, but they have not been found, and the rescue operation is still under pressure.
The mission will always be "in principle" and will continue to pay constant attention to this matter, encourage the Montaparte to continue to seek its full salvation and provide maximum assistance to the family of the party.
The Embassy called on Monrovia and Entrepreneurs to contact China ' s Embassy in Mongolia for the first time if they are aware of the relevant guidelines.
